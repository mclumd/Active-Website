        One major ongoing application of active logics is that of building a "conversationally 
        adequate" dialogue agent (see paper on <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/doc/conversational-adequacy/ver1_ss.html">Conversational 
        Adequacy</a> -- one can view such an agent as having the ability to learn 
        in McCarthy's sense of advice-taking, via conversation). 
      <p>We have accomplished the following goals (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/etai.ps">research 
        report</a>):
      <ol>
        <li> process a few simple queries via voice input, requiring the use of 
          negative introspection, in the context of the Rochester TRAINS system 
          rewritten to employ active logic. 
        <li> handle apparent contradictions as in "Send the Boston train to NYC... 
          [here the system does something]... No, send the Boston train to NYC" 
          where the system has misunderstood the first request and so the user 
          says "no" and repeats the same request. This requires the system to 
          recognize that "no" refers to the systems response rather than to the 
          user's first request. 
      </ol>
      <p>The long-range research plan envisions the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> understand and generate spelling in metadialogue ("The word I am 
          saying is spelled 'xyz'...") 
        <li> definitions and/or definitional queries ("What does the word 'xyz' 
          mean?") 
        <li> more general metadialogue: You said, I said, you meant, I meant, 
          etc 
        <li> reasoning about the physical and social worlds 
        <li> focus, attention and memory 
        <li> conversational adequacy
      </ol>
