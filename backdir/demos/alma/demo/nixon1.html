<h3> Nixon's pacifism I </h3>
<br>

<h4> Things to note </h4>
<ul>
<li> The formulas to deal with contradictions are identical to those
for the tweety example.
<li> We know the following at step 1.
<ul>
<li> Formula 0: nixon is a republican.
<li> Formula 1: nixon is a quaker.
<li> Formula quakersdoves: quakers are usually pacifists.
<li> Formula republicanhawks: republicans are usually not pacifists.
</ul>
<li> Note that we do not have any preference between these two
defaults. 
<li> At step 2 we conclude both that nixon is a pacifist and that he
is not a pacifist.
<li> This is detected and at step 3 we assert that there is a
contradiction, and that the contradictands are distrusted. At this
point, ALma has no opinion about whether Nixon is a pacifist.
<li> At step 4 the same contradiction resolution mechanism as for the
Tweety example kicks in.
<li> But since we do not have any preference, we cannot resolve the
contradiction and we still do not have any opinion of Nixon's
pacifism.
<li> 
</ul>
