<h4> Things to note </h4>
<ul>
<li> The history file, when loaded will be at the last step. Click on
|&lt to get to the first step.
<li> Click on &gt&gt to see the next step.
<li> At step 1 you see the contents of the database initially. We know
that
<ul>
<li> Formula 0: penguins are birds
<li> Formula birdsfly: birds usually fly
<li> Formula penguinsdontfly: penguins don't ususally fly
<li> Formual 1: we prefer the penguinsdontfly default to the birdsfly
one
<li> The rest of the formulas tell us about how to use this preference
together with information about the derivation of the formulas to
resolve conflicts.
</ul>
<li> At step 3 we add formula 10: tweety is a bird.
<li> This results in formula 12: tweety flies at step 4
<li> At step 6 we add formula 15: tweety is a penguin.
<li> At step 7 we therefore conclude that tweety does not fly.
<li> At step 8 we notice that this causes a contradiction and we
distrust formulas 18 and 12. This results in the system not knowing
whether tweety flies.
<li> At step 9 we start processing the contradiction to attempt a
resolution.
<li> At step 10 we find which defaults were used to derive the
contradictands. 
<li> From this information and the preference for penguinsdontfly, we
conclude that tweety does not fly and add this as formula 30.
