<h3>Simple alarm example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
Whenever it is time 10, we assert lunch.

<br>
<a href="../histories/simple_alarm_1.pl"> Alma specification</a>
<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> At step 1, Alma contains the description of the domain and the
fact that the time is 1.
<li> Nothing happens until now(10). At this point the antecedent of
the formula is satisfied and
<li> At step 11, lunch is asserted.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
lunch is asserted one step later than we intended because of the time
to reason about this. We could, of course, have taken that into
account in the specification formula. More interesting though would be
to have Alma realize itself that it has to start the reasoning earlier
