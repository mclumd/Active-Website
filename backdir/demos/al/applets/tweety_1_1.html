<h3>Tweety 1.1 example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
This example illustrates one way to represent and use default
information in active logic. The approach is to treat defaults just as
implications. This results in contradictions if the default should not
have been applied. We resolve contradictions by preferring the more
preferred default. See Tweety 2.* for an alternative approach.

<a href="../histories/tweety_1.pl"> Alma specification</a>
<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> The domain specification includes the following facts:
<ul>
<li> Penguins are birds.
<li> Penguins don't fly. 
<li> Birds fly.
<li> We prefer penguinsdontfly to birdfly.
<li> Formulas 2 to 5 specify how to resolve contradictions using the
preference above.
</ul>
<li> At step 4 we add that Tweety is a bird.
<li> At step 5 Alma concludes that Tweety flies.
<li> At step 11 we add that Tweety is a penguin.
<li> At step 12 we have both that Tweety flies and that it does not.
<li> This results in a contradiction and distrust formulas being added
in step 13.
<li> At step 14, the parents of the contradictands are computed.
<li> These are asserted into the KB at step 15.
<li> And at step 16, Alma decides to prefer that Tweety does not fly
based on the preference.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
The metainformation about the derivations of the formulas that is
maintainted by ALma is used in the axioms to determine which
contradictand to prefer. 
<br>
There are situations that are problematic for this simple approach to
defaults.
