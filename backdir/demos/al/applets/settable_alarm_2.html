<h3>Settable alarm II example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
The objective is similar to that of settable alarm I, but we specify
it differently. This time we say: if lunch is at T, then add a formula
that will assert lunch whenever it is T. THe difference here is that
the now has a constant argument so that we do not instantiate several
copies of the formula as in settable alarm I.

<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> Initially nothing happens since the antecedent of the formula is
lunch_at(X) and Alma does not know that.
<li> At step 4 we assert that lunch is at 12.
<li> This results, at step 6, in an assertion that whenever it is 12,
then we should assert that it is lunch time.
<li> Nothing happens until time 12.
<li> At time 13, lunch appears in the KB.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
Compare with Settable alarm I.
