  <LI>At step 1, Alma contains the description of the domain and the fact that 
  the time is 1. 
  <LI>Nothing happens until now(10). At this point the antecedent of the formula 
  is satisfied and 
  <LI>At step 11, lunch is asserted. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H4>Note:</H4>lunch is asserted one step later than we intended because of the 
time to reason about this. We could, of course, have taken that into account in 
the specification formula. More interesting though would be to have Alma realize 
itself that it has to start the reasoning earlier
