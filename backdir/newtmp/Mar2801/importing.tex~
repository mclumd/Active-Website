In this paper we hope to have supported the view that (explicit)
reasoning can be advantageous wherever there is uncertainty.  The
underlying idea is that by having a suitable reasoning component
attached to a procedural algorithm, that very algorithm becomes able
to monitor itself in real time, thereby affording certain protections
such as recognizing and correcting errors, and allowing for a kind of
learning for future error-advoidance.

In our view, this should apply almost across the board, not only to AI
programs, or to automated theorem-provers, but also to operating
systems.  Imagine an OS that...
