To create a new web page linked from the home ALMECOM page
(or any other of our pages), do this:

1. create your_page_name.shtml as a blank file

2. insert at the TOP of that file the line (*exactly this way*):

<!--#include virtual="include.shtml"-->

3. Insert *after* that line whatever you want to appear on your
page.  The line above (from 2.) will automatically read the
standard ALMECOM banner and sidebar into your page when it is
viewed.
