While it is planning, a reasoner spends time formulating plans and reasoning
about them. If the planning involves deadlines, then the reasoner needs to
take into account the time it takes to plan and also the time it takes to
take into account the time it is taking. Active logic enables us to design
planners that treat all aspects of planning as deadline coupled.
<p>

A long term aim of this work is to model a flexible reasoner with a large
database of knowledge, planning in deadline situations. Related areas are:
<ul>

Temporal projection.

<li>
Ramification.

<li>
Plan interaction.

<li>
Metaplanning.

</ul>
