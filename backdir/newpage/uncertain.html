      <p>It is easy to produce examples of applications that would benefit from 
        the addition of a reasoning component; from a system which could appropriately 
        adjust conditions on a manufacturing line to maintain quality, to one 
        which could help travelers make sensible vacation plans, what is desired 
        is a combination of the benefits of a human expert, able to apply knowledge 
        and experience to novel situations, and a computer, able to do this more 
        quickly, for more users, with less expense than the expert. However, the 
        real world is dynamic, complex, and not completely knowable. Its state 
        changes constantly and sometimes even drastically, complete modeling of 
        even its most narrow aspects is often computationally intractable, and 
        new things are always being discovered. Thus, any model of the world, 
        if it is to remain accurate<a href="#1">[1]</a>, must itself be capable 
        of dynamic responses to the world; further, because no model is complete, 
        any use to which the model is put (e.g. to serve as the basis for predictions, 
        or for the derivation of facts not currently represented in the model) 
        will produce uncertain results. Changes in, and discoveries about the 
        world will require not just revision of the model, but may require reconsideration 
        of any predictions, conclusions or generalizations in which the revised 
        beliefs played a role; such changes may even require alterations in the 
        methods or rules by which these derivations were generated. </p>

      <p>Responses to these issues fall into roughly two categories: those that 
        favor work with simplified models (e.g. microworlds, or formal domains 
        like mathematics), and those who favor work with simplified reasoners 
        (e.g. heuristics, or subsumption-architecture based robotics). Each approach 
        has advantages; the former can allow the application of rigorous, certain, 
        and theoretically justifiable methods; the latter can perform in real 
        (or realistic) environments. Of course, it will always be true that both 
        approaches are required, and preferences for one over the other will generally 
        be relative to the problem domain, but the division roughly corresponds 
        to one between formal and implementational research into machine reasoning. 
        This division is itself not completely firm: there are implementational 
        studies based on (formal or informal) theories (e.g., CYC, SOAR, OSCAR) 
        [Lenat and Guha, 1990; Lenat et. al., 1990], and there are theories framed 
        with attention toward implementation (e.g., predicate circumscription). 
        Formal/theoretical work tends to focus on very narrow problems (and even 
        on very special cases of very narrow problems) while trying to get them 
        "right" in a very strict sense. In contrast, implementational work tends 
        to aim at fairly broad ranges of behavior, with the focus less on getting 
        it "right" than with getting it to "work" within some acceptable range 
        of performance. It is sometimes urged that this gap is intrinsic to the 
        topic: intelligence is not a unitary thing for which there will be a single 
        theory, but rather a "society" of sub intelligences?some algorithmic and 
        strictly rule-governed, others heuristic and inexact, still others based 
        on reactivity and pattern-recognition?whose overall behavior cannot be 
        reduced to useful characterizing and predictive principles. </p>
      <p>Active Logic is a formal architecture that is more closely tied to implementational 
        constraints than is usual for formalisms, and which has been used to solve 
        a number of commonsense problems in a unified manner. In particular, Active 
        Logic seeks to apply theoretically justifiable, principled (logic-based) 
        methods of reasoning to dynamic, uncertain?and to this extent real-world?contexts. 
        [<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/dissertations/drapkin_thesis.ps.Z">Elgot- 
        Drapkin, 1988</a>; <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/survey_paper.ps">Elgot-Drapkin, 
        et. al., 1988</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/jetai.ps">Elgot-Drapkin 
        and Perlis, 1990</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/doc/MAnderson01.pdf">Bhatia, 
        et. al. 2001</a>] Instead of aiming at optimal solutions to isolated, 
        well-specified and temporally narrow problems, active logic was developed 
        to permit satisfying solutions to under-specified and temporally extended 
        problems, much closer to real-world needs. </p>
      <p>In order to bridge this gap, however, we need to be aware of the challenges 
        that face a logic-based formalism if it is to be applied to real-world 
        contexts; we need to know, that is, how the problem of uncertainty will 
        express itself. Two aspects of the problem of uncertainty in logic are 
        worth mentioning in particular: the <b>consistency check problem</b>, 
        and the <b>swamping problem</b>. </p>

      <p>One obvious way to deal with uncertainty and incomplete knowledge is 
        to make assumptions: in the absence of opposing evidence, assume such 
        and such, e.g. if it is a bird, assume it can fly. This is sometimes called 
        default reasoning. However, the situation is not so straightforward, because 
        (assuming that we want to maintain a consistent knowledge base) we will 
        need to check to see if the default assumption is in fact consistent with 
        our current knowledge state. This means not only must its negation not 
        appear in our belief set, but?and here's the rub?that negation must not 
        be logically entailed by those beliefs. But there is no general procedure 
        for determining whether a given belief is consistent with any given set 
        of beliefs; more generally, there is no procedure to determine whether 
        any given set of beliefs is itself consistent. This is the <b>consistency 
        check problem</b>. This problem has two consequences which are worth stating 
        more explicitly: (1) For any sufficiently complex knowledge base which 
        was not produced by logical rules from a database known to be consistent, 
        and/or to which non- entailed facts are to be added, it will not be possible 
        to know whether it is consistent, nor to use principled methods to maintain 
        consistency. Contradictions are in this sense practically inevitable. 
        (2) It is not possible to know, for any given proposition, whether that 
        proposition is derivable from current knowledge. But traditional approaches 
        to common sense reasoning operate on a broad sense of "know" or "believes", 
        such that it can be said that an agent knows what is currently in its 
        belief set, as well as anything derivable from that set. But since it 
        is not possible to predict (or to know) what an agent does, or does not 
        "know" on the basis of current beliefs, one must wait until processing 
        is complete (until one has produced the set of all derivable theorems) 
        to discover what the agent knows. Not only is this not cognitively plausible, 
        but under conditions of uncertainty, in which formulas are periodically 
        added to and removed from the knowledge base, there can never be a time 
        when processing is complete. </p>
      <p>This brings us to the <b>swamping problem</b>. In addition to the obvious 
        reasons for wanting to maintain consistency (if we are to query our knowledge 
        base, we would generally prefer to get an answer, and not an answer and 
        its negation), there is another, more theoretical reason: from a contradiction, 
        everything follows. More technically, given a contradiction, all well 
        formed formulas (wff's) are entailed as theorems. This is the swamping 
        problem, for it means that a knowledge base that contains a contradiction 
        will eventually contain all possible propositions. This would seem to 
        hamper its usefulness as a knowledge base, not to mention occupy a good 
        deal of memory. However, it is worth noting that this is a practical problem 
        only in so far as it is imagined that our interest is exclusively in the 
        end- state of the reasoning system, for all implementations of standard 
        logic draw conclusions in steps, and it may be some time before any given 
        knowledge base is effectively swamped; time enough to detect and address 
        the problem. What is wanted, then, for real-world applications, is a model 
        of logical reasoning that can: </p>
      <p>(1) continue to reason in the presence of contradictions (since they 
        are inevitable)</p>
      <p> (2) be able to detect contradictions, curtail nonsensical inferences, 
        and initiate repairs </p>

      <p>(3) shift the evaluative focus from some final future state of knowledge, 
        to the current contents of the knowledge base. </p>
      <p>Active Logic is designed to meet these desiderata. </p>
      <p>Motivated in part by the thought that human reasoning takes place step-wise, 
        in time?and that this feature supports human mental flexibility?Active 
        Logic works by combining inference rules with a constantly evolving measure 
        of time (a "Now") that can itself be referenced in those rules. As an 
        example, from <i>Now (t)</i>?the time is now "t"?one infers <i>Now (t+1)</i>, 
        for the fact of an inference implies that time (at least one 'time-step') 
        has passed. All the inference rules in Active Logic work temporally in 
        this way: at each time-step all possible one step inferences are made, 
        and only propositions derived at time t are available for inferences at 
        time <i>t+1</i>. There are special persistence rules so that every theorem 
        a present at time <i>t</i> implies itself at time <i>t+1</i>; likewise 
        there are special rules so that if the knowledge base contains both a 
        theorem <i>a</i> and its negation <i>?a</i>, these theorems and their 
        consequences are "distrusted" so they are neither carried forward themselves 
        nor used in further inference.<a href="#2">[2]</a> </p>

      <p>From these features come others, most notably: </p>
      <p>- A given knowledge base is only considered to be in an inconsistent 
        state if it contains a theorem and its negation. </p>
      <p>- Contradictory information can be detected and used to curtail nonsensical 
        inferences as well as to initiate repairs. This removes the swamping problem 
        as an issue. </p>
      <p>- Because contradiction handling takes place in the same context as all 
        reasoning, all the information in the knowledge base can be brought to 
        bear on the process of resolving a contradiction. </p>
      <p>- The consistency check required by default reasoning can be characterized 
        in terms of lookups to see whether one has information (directly) contrary 
        to the default. </p>
      <p>- Ignorance-assessment amounts a lookup, at time t, of what was known 
        prior to t. </p>

      <p>- Reasoning can be kept current, i.e., inferences can be triggered to 
        occur when they should, and this is done declaratively, so that is also 
        under control of (easily modifiable) inferences. </p>
      <p>- At any given time, propositions can be added or removed from the knowledge 
        base without requiring a (in any case practically impossible) consistency 
        check. </p>
      <p>- The fact that the reasoning process explicitly takes place in time 
        offers a natural framework for reasoning in time-sensitive contexts (as 
        many industrial applications will be); for instance, the fact that the 
        reasoning takes time can itself be a reason for preferring non-optimal 
        (but easily computable) solutions; likewise, strategies for reasoning 
        or acting can be changed as deadlines approach in light of those approaching 
        deadlines. To put it more generally: reasoning in time is a natural way 
        to implement reasoning about time. </p>
