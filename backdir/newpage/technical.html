      <p>Active Logic is a kind of "step logic," which was developed in <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/dissertations/drapkin_thesis.ps.Z">[Elgot-Drapkin, 
        1988]</a> as formal mechanism for modeling the ongoing process of reasoning. 
        Unlike traditional logical formalisms, a step-logic does not calculate 
        a final set of conclusions which can be drawn from an initial set of facts, 
        but rather monitors the ever-changing set of conclusions as time goes 
        on. Such logics were introduced in order to achieve a number of related 
        goals: more realistic representation and reasoning about time; the ability 
        to reason with and about inconsistency, and the ability to reason about 
        the reasoning process itself. These goals remain central in work we report 
        here; in addition we examine issues involving natural language, multi-agent 
        cooperation and autonomous agency. We start by presenting a fairly abstract 
        definition of an active logic. Such logic is closely linked to an inference 
        engine. </p>

      <p>An <b>active logic</b> consists of a formal language (typically first-order) 
        and inference rules, such that the application of a rule depends not only 
        on what formulas have (or have not) been proven so far (this is also true 
        of static logics) but also on what formulas are in the "current" belief 
        set. Not every previously proven formula need be current. In general the 
        current beliefs are only a subset of all formulas proven so far: each 
        is believed when first proven but some may subsequently have been rejected. 
      </p>
      <p>Active Logics all have the following characteristics: </p>
      <p>-They are situated in time, </p>
      <p>-They maintain a history, </p>
      <p>-They tolerate contradictions, </p>

      <p>-They enable meta-reasoning to be done. </p>
      <p>Based on the above definition, active logics are a family of inference 
        engines that incorporate a history of their own reasoning as they run. 
        Thus at any time <i>t</i>, an active logic has a record of its reasoning 
        at all times prior to <i>t</i>, and it also knows that the current time 
        is <i>t</i>. As it continues to reason from time <i>t</i>, that reasoning 
        is also recorded in the history, marked at time <i>t+1</i> as having occurred 
        at time <i>t</i>. Thus an active logic records the passage of time in 
        discrete steps, and the "current" time slides forward as the system runs. 
        It is convenient to regard its current inferences as occurring in a working 
        memory, that is then transferred to the history (or long-term memory) 
        in the next time-step. Thus, an active logic has time-sensitive inference 
        rules and consequently time-sensitive inferences. </p>

      <p>In active logics the current time is itself noted in the working memory-<i>Now(t)</i>-and 
        this changes to <i>Now(t+1)</i> one step later. (A time-step should be 
        thought of as very fast, perhaps 0.1 sec in correspondence with performance 
        of elementary cognitive tasks by humans). Thus active logics "ground" 
        <i>Now</i> in terms of real time-passage during reasoning. </p>
      <p>These characteristics make active logics suitable for use in various 
        domains including time situated planning and execution <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/prac7.ps">[Purang, 
        et. al., 1999]</a>; reasoning about other agents <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/know-ign.ps">[Kraus 
        and Perlis, 1989]</a>; reasoning about dialog <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/lang/mnm-si.ps.Z">[Perlis, 
        et. al., 1998</a>; <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/etai.ps">Traum, 
        et. al., forthcoming]</a>, including updating and using discourse context 
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/papers/lang/ci97.ps.Z">[Gurney, 
        1997]</a>; and autonomous agency <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/doc/WRAC/sevendays.pdf">[Chong, 
        et. al., 2001]</a>. </p>
