Some Problems with Traditional AI.
</font>
<p>


Critics of AI often remark that AI programs are "stupid"-they
do not "really" understand anything, and thus are easily thrown
into disarray and made useless. To some extent this criticism is
well-taken: most AI systems "break" when conditions vary even 
slightly outside of very narrow "safe" bounds. A "smart" agent
should be flexible enough able to take in stride lots of different
kinds of incoming information: contradictions, nonsense, change
of topic, ambiguity, and so on. Yet when the "safe" bounds are
violated, systems tend not to be able to provide reasonable behaviors, 
such as recognizing that they cannot correctly parse the input, or
that a contradiction has occurred, or that a belief must be revised. 
In effect, systems often lack "common sense" when faced with 
situations not anticipated by their designers.

<p>

However, this is not an essential defect of computational systems.
Indeed many researchers are working in the area of automated
commonsense reasoning. The idea our group is pursuing is that by
making a system include detailed information about its own history, 
it can be made much more  robust under varied conditions: misidentifications,
contradictions, conflicting advice, context shifts, new words, new
meanings for old words, belief revision, tight deadlines, and 
ambiguities. In short, if a system has information about its own past, 
it then might be able to analyze what it has been doing, recognize 
trouble, and make decisions as to whether it needs to alter any of
its past behavior.

What are Active Logics?
</font>
<p>


Active logics are a family of inference engines, that incorporate 
a history of their own reasoning
as they run. Thus at any time <i>T</i>, an active logic has a record of
its reasoning at all times prior to <i>T</i>, and it also knows that the
current time is <i>T</i>. As it continues to reason from time <i>T</i>, that
reasoning is also recorded in the history, marked at time <i>T+1</i> as
having occurred at time <i>T</i>. Thus an active logic records the passage
of time in discrete steps, and the "current" time slides forward
as the system runs. It is convenient to regard its current inferences
as occurring in a working memory, that is then transferred to the
history (or long-term memory) in the next time-step.

<p>

The key aspect that makes such logics different from traditional
temporal logics and from simple archival "dumps": in active logics 
the current time is itself noted in the working memory-<i>Now(T)</i>-and 
this changes to <i>Now(T+1)</i> one step later. (A time-step should be thought 
of as very fast, perhaps 0.1 sec in correspondence with performance of 
elementary cognitive tasks by humans). Thus active logics "ground" <i>Now</i>
in terms of real time-passage during reasoning.
