Problems with AI.

Critics of AI often remark that AI programs are "stupid"-they
do not "really" understand anything, and thus are easily thrown
into disarray and made useless. To some extent this criticism is
well-taken: most AI systems "break" when conditions vary even 
slightly outside of very narrow "safe" bounds. A "smart" agent
should be flexible enough able to take in stride lots of different
kinds of incoming information: contradictions, nonsense, change
of topic, ambiguity, and so on. Yet when the "safe" bounds are
violated, systems tend not to be able to provide reasonable behaviors, 
such as recognizing that they cannot correctly parse the input, or
that a contradiction has occurred, or that a belief must be revised. 
In effect, systems often lack "common sense" when faced with 
situations not anticipated by their designers.

<p>

However, this is not an essential defect of computational systems.
Indeed many researchers are working in the area of automated
commonsense reasoning. The idea our group is pursuing is that by
making a system include detailed information about its own history, 
it can be made much more  robust under varied conditions: misidentifications,
contradictions, conflicting advice, context shifts, new words, new
meanings for old words, belief revision, tight deadlines, and 
ambiguities. In short, if a system has information about its own past, 
it then might be able to analyze what it has been doing, recognize 
trouble, and make decisions as to whether it needs to alter any of
its past behavior.
