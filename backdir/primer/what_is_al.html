What is an Active Logic?

<br>

Active logics are a family of inference engines, that incorporate 
a history of their own reasoning
as they run. Thus at any time <i>T</i>, an active logic has a record of
its reasoning at all times prior to <i>T</i>, and it also knows that the
current time is <i>T</i>. As it continues to reason from time <i>T</i>, that
reasoning is also recorded in the history, marked at time <i>T+1</i> as
having occurred at time <i>T</i>. Thus an active logic records the passage
of time in discrete steps, and the "current" time slides forward
as the system runs. It is convenient to regard its current inferences
as occurring in a working memory, that is then transferred to the
history (or long-term memory) in the next time-step.

<p>

The key aspect that makes such logics different from traditional
temporal logics and from simple archival "dumps": in active logics 
the current time is itself noted in the working memory-<i>Now(T)</i>-and 
this changes to <i>Now(T+1)</i> one step later. (A time-step should be thought 
of as very fast, perhaps 0.1 sec in correspondence with performance of 
elementary cognitive tasks by humans). Thus active logics "ground" <i>Now</i>
in terms of real time-passage during reasoning.
