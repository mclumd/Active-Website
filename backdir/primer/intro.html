Introduction to Active Logics.

<p>
The idea we have been pursuing is that by
making a system include detailed information about its own history, 
it can be made much more  robust under varied conditions: misidentifications,
contradictions, conflicting advice, context shifts, new words, new
meanings for old words, belief revision, tight deadlines, and 
ambiguities. In short, if a system has information about its own past, 
it then might be able to analyze what it has been doing, recognize 
trouble, and make decisions as to whether it needs to alter any of
its past behavior.
<p>
We have been designing a new family of inference engines, called
<em>active logics</em>, that incorporate a history of their own reasoning
as they run. At any time T, an active logic has a record of
its reasoning at all times prior to T, and it also knows that the
current time is T. As it continues to reason from time T, that
reasoning is also recorded in the history, marked at time T+1 as
having occurred at time T. Thus an active logic records the passage
of time in discrete steps, and the ``current'' time slides forward
as the system runs. It is convenient to regard its current inferences
as occurring in a working memory, that is then transferred to the
history (or long-term memory) in the next time-step.
<p>
There is a key aspect that makes such logics different from traditional
temporal logics and from simple archival ``dumps'': in active logics 
the current time is itself noted in the working memory <em>NOW(T) </em>and 
this changes to <em>NOW(T+1)</em> one step later. (A time-step should be thought 
of as very fast, perhaps 0.1 sec in correspondence with performance of 
elementary cognitive tasks by humans). Thus active logics ``ground'' <em>NOW</em> 
in terms of real time-passage during reasoning. In particular, inference 
rules can take the current time into account; so an active logic is a
blend of syntax and semantics: there is a "real" value of <em>NOW</em> given in
a canonical model with a clock, and this (changing) value influences the 
inferences that are drawn.
<p>
With this notion of history, we have been performing various experiments 
in automated commonsense reasoning, aimed at a variety of complementary
automated capabilities, including the following topics:
