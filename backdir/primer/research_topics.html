Our research involves the integration of several of the following list
of interrelated topics in active logics.
<ul>
<li>
	 situated reasoning (time and space)
<li>
	 symbol-grounding 
<li>
	 error-detection and recovery
<li>
	 cognitive modeling
<li>
	 advice-taking
<li>
	 changing one's mind
<li>
	 formalization of discourse
<li>
	 memory limitations
<li>
	 commonsense reasoning/problem-solving
<li>
	 language change
<li>
	 learning
<li>
	 using the past as a guide to the present
</ul>

The broad theme is the design of agents with "common sense": ones 
that are not necessarily very good at any particular task but that 
are able to maintain a focus, an assessment of what the task or topic 
is, or that it has changed, or that it is not clear, that help is
needed, that the task should be given up, etc. A familiar human
setting is that of trying to follow an expert discourse, or perhaps
a discourse in a foregin language, and missing a lot of the details:
the agent knows that it is not following well, and that there are
things it can try to deal with this (asking questions, getting a
translator, giving up altogether).
