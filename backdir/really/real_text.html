How is active logic about this, you ask?
<p>
Well, let's see what must be running around Alice's mind:
<p>
First, the March Hare says: "The roses are not in the fridge". Alice
naturally thinks that there is some fridge and some roses that 
the Hare is talking about, and that these roses are not in that fridge. Maybe
the roses are elsewhere-like in the Hatter's hat.
<p>
Then the Mad Hatter says that the reason the roses are not in the fridge is
that there are no roses!!
<p>
Now, Alice is momentarily confused. This is what she has in her mind:
<p>
1. there are roses <p>
2. there is a fridge <p>
3. these roses are not in that fridge <p>
4. there are no roses <p>

There is something wrong here. How can 1 and 4 be true at the same time?
<p>
Alice needs to think hard now (that's why she looks puzzled). Which of the
two is true? 1 was not said by the Hare, Alice assumed it was true to make
sense of what the Hare said (This is a 
<a href="/projects/active/presup/presup.html">
presupposition
</a>
 ).
4 was asserted by the Hatter. And 4 makes
the Hare's sentence make sense: there are no roses, so it cannot be true that
the roses are in the fridge. A bit odd, but perfectly reasonable.
<p>
Alice concludes that it is likely that 1 was a wrong assumption for her to
make so she rejects that and keeps 4.
<p>
Now everything's fine. Alice is not confused anymore. What she has in her
mind now is:
<p>
1. there is a fridge <p>
2. there are no roses <p>
3. there are no roses in that fridge <p>

Active logic gives a way to model this type of thing. Traditional logics tend
to roll over and die when they see a contradiction, but active logic does not.
It lets you look back, reason about the cause of the contradiction and resolve
it in some way.
<p>
If you want to know more about the fridge and roses story, 
<a href="/projects/active/papers/ijcai95.ps"> here </a>
is a paper on
that. Or you might want to go to an 
<a href="/projects/active/primer/new_intro.html">
introduction  </a> on active logic.
