ADEQUACY<br>
</span></b><br>
<br>
<i>Our long-range aim is to design and
implement common sense in a computer</i>.<br>
<br>
Common sense in a computer
is a bit hard to define, but the idea we are aiming at is comparable to
human-level common sense (often understood as distinct from expert or special
cleverness).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For
instance, solving
the mutilated checkerboard problem takes a special clever insight, and thus is
not what we have in mind. But note that much of the AI community would not draw
the definitional lines as we have; for that reason, we sometimes use the
expression ``cognitive adequacy'' to refer to our conception.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is intended to suggest a kind of
general-purpose reasoning ability that will serve the agent to ``get along''
(learning as it goes) in a wide and unpredicted range of environments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consequently, one hallmark of common sense
is the ability to recognize, and initiate appropriate responses to, novelty, error,
and confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Examples of such
responses include learning from mistakes, aligning action with reasoning and
vice versa, and seeking (and taking) advice.<br>
<br>
A closely related
hallmark is the ability to reason about anything whatever (that is brought to
one's attention). This does not mean being clever about it, or knowing much about
it, or being able to draw significant conclusions; it can mean as little as
realizing that the topic is not understood, asking for more information, and
learning appropriately from whatever advice is given.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>That may seem like very little, if our model is to have clever
solutions to tricky problems. But consider this: virtually no AI programs
exhibit even that ``little'' amount of elementary common sense; they are not
able to know when they are confused, let alone seek -- and use – clarifying data.
On the other hand, cleverness -- in highly limited domains and for tightly
specified representations -- has been built into many programs, a kind of
``idiot savantry'' that fails utterly when outside those narrow
strictures.<br>
<br>
One large piece of what is needed for cognitive adequacy
then appears to be what we call ``perturbation tolerance'': the ability to keep
going adequately when subjected to unanticipated changes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thisincludes changes to the knowledge base (KB);
e.g. the changes might introduce inconsistencies, or make a goal impossible or
ambiguous. Worse, the knowledge representation (KR) system might change (new terms,
new meanings for old terms, different notational conventions, etc), especially
if other agents are involved; and of course there are typos (missing
parentheses and the like) that appear to defy any prearranged methodology.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And there are changes to physical sensors and
effectors, and how things in the world work.<br>
<br>
Then what is it to
``keep going adequately'' in the face of such changes?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among other things, this will require (i)
never ``hanging'' or ``breaking''; (ii) recognizing when there is a difficulty
to be addressed; (iii) making an assessment of options to deal with the difficulty;
(iv) choosing and putting an option into action.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Such a suite of abilities will require keeping track of one's own
history of activity, including one's own past reasoning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such an agent will then, in Nilsson's
phrase, have a lifetime of its own, and keeping track of its own processes and
history will allow it to look back at what it is doing and use that knowledge
to guide its upcoming behavior.<br>
<br>
People tend to do this well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We think there is strong evidence as to how,
and we have a specific hypothesis about it and how to build it in a
computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a nutshell, we propose
what we call the metacognitive loop---that allows a reasoning agent to note,
and attempt to correct, errors in real time---as the essential distinguishing
feature of cognitive adequacy, including perturbation tolerance. And we claim that
the state of the art is very nearly where it needs to be, to allow this to be
designed and implemented.<br>
