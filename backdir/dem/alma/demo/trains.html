<h4> Things to note </h4>
<ul>
<li>
This example is meant to illustrate that Alma is not limited to small
tiny examples. In this case we have a total of 4374 formulas in the
database. 
<li>
Please give enough time for the history to load. It takes a while. The
last step is 1808.
<li> At step 74, we get a message from the Trains system that
indicates the start of a session.
<li> At step 257 there is a noisy input that is ignored.
<li> At step 605 the user asks: "Where are the trains?" The list of
train locations is output by step 644.
<li> At step 773 the user says: "Send the Washington train to Toronto"
and the system does that.
<li> At step 1095 the user says: "Send the Charleston train to
Toronto" and the system does that.
<li> At step 1314 the user says: "Send the Toronto train to Montreal",
meaning to send the train that originated from Charleston but the system 
chooses to send the train that originated from Washington instead. The
system interprets both of these to be "the Toronto train" and picks
one arbitrarily.
<li> At step 1474 the user says: "No" because the system sent the
wrong train. The system undoes the last operation. 
<li> At step 1612 the user repeats: "Send the Toronto train to
Montreal". This time the system picks the other train since its first
choice was not correct. This satisfies the user's initial intention.
</ul>
