<a href="../alma.html">Alma</a> (and <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/">active logic</a> in
general)  is a versatile reasoning tool that has
been applied to many problems. This page illustrates some of these
applications by means of episodes of reasoning in Alma.

<h4> What is there to view?</h4> 

It is currently not possible to run Alma across the web. Presenting
the final state of the KB after the reasoning is not very helpful
because the reasoning in Alma depends on the state of the KB at each
time step.
<p>
Alma however, can write history files that record every addition and
deletion to the database at each step. This is what we display
here. Accompanying the history in each example is an account of the
events of interest in the reasoning.
<p>
The history is presented in an applet that allows one to move through
the steps and see how the reasoning happened. In this way we preserve
the dynamic character of reasoning in Alma.

<h4> How to view the examples</h4> 

The interface is intuitive enough, but a manual is available <a
href="../Alma/gi/userguide.html">here</a>. 
<p>
Some suggestions:
<ul>
<li> The applet will load the history file, and stop at the last step. Click on
|&lt to get to the first step.
<li> Click on &gt&gt to see the next step.
<li> There might be some error messages about the scrollbar. These can
be ignored.
</ul>
