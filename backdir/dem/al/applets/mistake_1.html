<h3> Mistake example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
In this example, Alma makes a mistake in its reasoning, discovers that
it made a mistake and changes its mind, and asserts those times that
it was mistaken.
<br>
Alma knows that:
<ul>
<li> Birds fly.
<li> Penguins don't fly.
<li> We prefer the latter to the former.
<li> Only birds that breed in Antarctica are penguins, skuas or
petrels.
<li> Petrels do not dive to 150 feet.
<li> Skuas do not dive to 150 feet.
<li> Tweety is a bird.
<li> Tweety breeds in Antarctica.
<li> Tweety dives to 150 feet.
</ul>
From this information, Alma first infers that Tweety flies. A few
steps later, Alma infers that Tweety is a penguin and does not
fly. This causes a contradiction that is resolved in favor of Tweety
not flying. Then Alma looks back at its reasoning to find the times
that it was mistaken about Tweety flying. This is asserted as <pre>
mistake(flies(tweety), T)</pre>

<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> At step 1, all the informationis known.
<li> At step 2, Alma derives that Tweety flies.
<li> At step 5, Alma finds that Tweety is a penguin.
<li> At step 6, this produces a contradiction.
<li> The contradiction is resolved by step 11 and ALma starts finding
when it was mistaken.
<li> At step 20, Alma finds that it was mistaken between steps 2 to 5. 
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
Finding the mistakes depends on reasoning about the derivation of the
rejected contradictand. This reasoning is specified in the Alma logic
itself using the formulas input at step 1.
<br>
Recall that the only actions Alma automatically takes in case of
contradiction are to distrust the contradictands and their
descendants and to assert that there has been a contradiction.
