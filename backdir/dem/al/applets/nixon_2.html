</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<li> At step 1, all the information is present. We know that Nixon is
a republican quaker and the defaults that republicans are not
pacifists and quakers are.
<li> At step 2, Alma attempts to apply both the defaults.
<li> At step 3, Alma does not see any objection to applying them.
<li> At step 4, Alma gets both that Nixon is pacifist and not.
<li> This is noted as a contradiction at step 5 and Alma distrusts the
contradictands.
<li> Both the contradictands are found to depend on defaults at step
7. 
<li> These defaults are not related, so there is nothing much Alma can
do now. Alma has no opinion as to whether Nixon is a pacifist or not.
