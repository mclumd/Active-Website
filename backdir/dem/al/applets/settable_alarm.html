<h3> Settable alarm I example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
We assert the time for lunch and at the right time, Alma asserts that
it is lunch time.
<br>

<a href="../histories/settable_alarm.pl"> Alma specification</a>
<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> Alma start with the description of the solution to the problem at
step 1. This consists of a single assertion: "if it is now T and lunch
is at T, assert lunch."
<li> At step 1, the assertion is instantiated with T = 1 since now it
is 1. But since Alma does not have lunch_at(1), nothing happens.
<li> The same thing happens for eachof the other stpes.
<li> At step 11 we assert lunch_at(12).
<li> At step 12 the antecedents are true and
<li> At step 13 Alma asserts 'lunch'
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
The time at which lunch is asserted is one step later than the time we
specified because of the time the inference takes.
<br>
This looks like a rather strange way to do things because we have one
of the "lunch_at(X) -> lunch" assertions derived for each step. See
Settable alarm II for an alternative.
