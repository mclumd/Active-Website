You want a server-side include.  

Rename the file in which you want to include the common data as
"page.shtml" instead of just "page.html".  The server only knows to
interpret the include commands for .shtml files.

Inside page.shtml, include the subfile like so: 

	<!--#include virtual="subfile.html"-->

...and that should do what you want. 

You can see an example in most of the departmental webpages; I just looked at
the class webpage,

	/fs/www/class/index.shtml

for this one. 

Let us know if you need additional help,
