<h2> Tests of nmAlma </h2>
<p>
I collected a number of examples of non-monotonic reasoning from the
literature, coded these in the nmAlma language and ran these
tests. In a large number of the examples nmAlma gets the right
answer. Some of the examples are beyond the capabilitites of nmALma
for the moment.
<p>
The examples have been roughly classified in the following
categories. These are not exclusive sets and if an example fits in
more than one category, it is arbitrarily placed in one of them.
<p>
Each of the links below points to a category of examples. For each we
have a description of the example, the nmAlma code that was used to
solve the example and an applet that shows the evolution of the KB in
those examples.
<p>
An account of nmAlma is provided <a href="../logic.html"> here </a>.
