<h3>Nonmonotonic reasoning I </h3>

There are several ways one could exhibit nonmonotonic reasoning
behavior in Alma. This is one of the simplest ways. We just take
defaults to be like implications and apply without consideration for
other defaults. If there is a conflict though, Alma eventually derives
a contradiction which is then resolved using a preference relation
between the defaults. If there is no preference, neither contradictand
is reinstated and Alma is uncertain about the fact in question.
<br>
This is rather simplistic and there are obvious deficiencies. See <a
href="nonmonotonic_2.html> Nonmonotonic reasoning II</a> for a more
sophisticated approach.


<ul>
<li>
The <a href=tweety_1_1.html> Tweety I</a> example is the usual
non-flying bird example. In this case, we are first told that Tweety
is a bird, then that it is a penguin.

<li>
The <a href=tweety_1_2.html> Tweety II</a> example is a slight
variation on the previous one. Here the first thing we are told is
that Tweety is a penguin. However, we can still infer that it is a
bird because all penguins are birds.
