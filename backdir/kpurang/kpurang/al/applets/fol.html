<h3>First order logic </h3>
Note:
<ul>
<li> Alma is resolution based so it will not be complete in the
forward chaining mode.
<li> We have backward chaining too. It is a breadth first backward
chaining. We hypothesize that that CSR does not involve very long
chains of reasoning so that breadth first searches end soon and can be
cleaned up.
<li> There are some options in doing the backward search. One of them
is to leave the search always active so that whenever we get new
information that was not present when we started the search, we will
succeed whenever that informatino comes in.
<li> Need to find some way to SHOW the backward searches in the
GUI. Maybe we will need to look at the node crefully and have a flag
for backward search. Can reverse video them or something.
<li> Need to fix the resolution. I think the problem is that we
resolve the same thing several times to get the same result. Need to
do that but separately. Not so sure.
