<h3>The Nixon example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
This is the well known Nixon example. Alma knows that Nixon is both a
republican (who are not pacifists) and a quaker (who are). Alma cannot
decide whether Nixon is pacifist or not.

<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> Alma start off with information as to how to handle
contradictions and that repubicans are not pacifists, quakers are and
nixon is both.
<li> At step 2, Alma derives both that nixon is pacifist and that he is
not.
<li> At step 3, Alma asserts that there is a contradiction and
distrusts the contradictands.
<li> At step 4, Alma applies the contradiction handling axioms to try
to resolve the problem.
<li> But that gets nowhere because we did not provide any preference
information. So Alma believes neither that nixon is a pacifist nor
that he is not a pacifist.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
If we were to later add that we prefer that "quakers are pacifists" to
"republicans are not pacifists", then Alma will conclude that nixon is
a pacifist.
