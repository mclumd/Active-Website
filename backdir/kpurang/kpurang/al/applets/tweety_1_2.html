<h3>Tweety 1.2 example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
This example illustrates one way to represent and use default
information in active logic. The approach is to treat defaults just as
implications. This results in contradictions if the default should not
have been applied. We resolve contradictions by preferring the more
preferred default. See Tweety 2.* for an alternative approach.

This is a variation on Tweety 1.1. This time we first assert that
Tweety is a penguin before asserting it is a bird.

<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> The domain specification includes the following facts:
<ul>
<li> Penguins are birds.
<li> Penguins don't fly. 
<li> Birds fly.
<li> We prefer penguinsdontfly to birdfly.
<li> Formulas 2 to 5 specify how to resolve contradictions using the
preference above.
</ul>
<li> At step 3 we assert that Tweety is  apenguin.
<li> At step 4 Alma infers both that Tweety does not fly and that it
is a bird.
<li> At step 5 Alma also infers that Tweety flies since it is a bird.
<li> This gives rise to a contradiction and distrust at step 6.
<li> At step 7 Alma finds the parents of the contradictands.
<li> At step 9, Alma chooses to believe that Tweety does not fly based
on the preference.

</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
The metainformation about the derivations of the formulas that is
maintainted by ALma is used in the axioms to determine which
contradictand to prefer. 
<br>
There are situations that are problematic for this simple approach to
defaults.
