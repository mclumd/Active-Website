<P>
It is to be noted that this example does not involve any actions other
than manipulating the KB. Further, the changes done to the KB as a
result of a mistake are simple and are the same for all possible
mistakes that we consider. These factors make it easy to resolve the
problem simply with representing that we have a mistake and invoking
a standard method to resolve it.

<P>
If there were actions undertaken in the world or if the response to
the mistakes were more complex, it is unlikely that just asserting
<I>contra</I> would have sufficed. It may have been necessary to explicitly
indicate which beliefs, intentions and actions were mistaken to be
able to respond appropriately.
