Discussion of the solution</A>
</H1>

<P>
This problem, the solution and the representation of the solution
differ from those in the presupposition problem case. However, the
part of the solution relating to mistakes is similar.

<P>
In this example as well as the previous one, the detection of a
mistake occurs when a direct contradiction is found. This says that
there is a mistake somewhere, but it is not clear what the mistake
is. This logic, just like that one for the presuppositions, prevents
the potentially mistaken formulas from being used to derive new
formulas. The way it does it in this case though, is to disinherit it
so that it does not appear in future steps.

<P>
The specific strategy to decide which beleif is mistaken depends on
the domain. In this implicature domain, the strategy is simply to
prefer beleifs over implicatures. This is expressed in:

<P>
<PRE>
(mt:((contra((imp:X), (bel:Y))) =&gt; (bel:Y)))@0.
(mt:((contra((bel:Y), (imp:X))) =&gt; (bel:Y)))@0.
</PRE>
<P>
If there is a contradiction between an implicature <I>X</I> and a belief
<I>Y</I>, then <I>Y</I> will be added at the next step. Since once a
contradiction is noticed the formulas are disinherited, the
implicature is not present in the next step.

<P>
At this point, we have discovered what the mistake is: it is the
implicature. This is not explicitly asserted in the database in this
simple approach to mistakes. It is sufficient, in this example, for the
mistaken beleifs not to be present in the subsequent steps and that is
accomplished automatically.

<P>
In the second example, we have a contradiction between two
implicatures. In our simple approach, there is no way to resolve such
a contradiction so both contradictands remain dissinherited. In this
case we have not identified what the mistake is: whether it is that
the roses are fresh or that they are not fresh.

<P>
Once again, if there had been actions taken on the basis of the
mistaken beliefs or if we had recursive mistakes, it would have been
necessary to explicitly assert and reason about the mistaken
beliefs. The example, as the previous one, shows, however, that in
cases where the behavior is limited, one can get by with a much
simpler way to handle mistakes.

<P>
