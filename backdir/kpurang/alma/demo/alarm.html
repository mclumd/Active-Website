<h3> The settable alarm example </h3>
<br>
<h4> Things to note </h4>
<ul>
<li> In this case, the alarm is not preset to any time. We can use
set_alarm(X) to set the alarm to go off at time X.
<li> Once we set the alarm, formula 0 asserts a new formula that waits
for that time. This formula is similar to the one in the fixed alarm
example. 
<li> At step 4 we set the alarm to time 10.
<li> At step 6, this results in formula 8: whenever it is time 10,
assert WAKE_UP
<li> Nothing happens until step 10.
<li> At step 11 WAKE_UP is asserted in the KB.
<li> Although we specify the alarm to go off at time 10, it does so at
time 11 because it is at time 10 that we realize it is time 10 and the
earliest we can assert a new formula is time 11.
