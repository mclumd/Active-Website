features should be added later.

2. Note: Dates are Year Month Date as 2000 12 31
	 If no web page is available, leave it blank
	 The description is a short description of the conference that
	 is saved locally.

3. Click [Add]

4. To save it in the database, click [Save]

5. To generate the webpage, click [->Html]

6. To exit, click [Exit]

7. Note: if you do not [Save], the entry will not be saved
	 if you do not [->Html], the web page will not be generated
	 so, if you want to exit without modifying anything, [Exit]

To delete a conference:

1. Look for the entry number in the bottom text area.

2. Enter that number after the "Entry #:"

3. Click [Delete]

4. Here too, to save your changes and have these reflected on the web
   page, you need to [Save], [->Html]


Note: the "More Information" field in the bottom text area will look
like a date. This is the name of the file in which the information was
stored.
