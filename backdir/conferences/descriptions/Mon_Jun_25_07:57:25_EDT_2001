BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
The EIS conference series pursue the synthesis of Artificial Intelligence 
techniques with Control Engineering methods to produce Intelligent Systems for 
Engineering applications. In recent years, the combination of Control Engineering 
and extensive knowledge of AI techniques has allowed scientists and practitioners 
to make a number of significant contributions to this rapidly developing field, 
for example in qualitative control, fuzzy qualitative simulation and model 
based diagnosis, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Fuzzy 
Logic (FL), and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (NFS). 

The EIS conference series intend to provide researchers and practitioners from 
industry and academia with a platform to report on recent developments in the 
area of intelligent systems with focus on applications of computational 
intelligence techniques to engineering systems. The meeting will also provide a venue 
for dialogues between software engineers, systems designers and knowledge 
engineers
