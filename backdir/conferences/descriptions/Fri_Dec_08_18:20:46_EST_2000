             Sixth International Conference on
       Cooperative Information Systems (CoopIS 2001)

            http://www.science.unitn.it/coopis/

                      Trento, Italy
                   September 5-7, 2001


The Cooperative Information System (CIS) paradigm has gained
substantial importance in the last years: middleware and Web
technologies, e-Commerce, e-Government, virtual enterprises are
examples of its concrete application.


What is CoopIS ?
----------------

CoopIS is the leading conference for researchers and practioners about
CIS:
* The subject matter is the foundation and implementation of
  cooperation among systems.
* The CoopIS area is a meeting of disciplines which provide concepts
  and techniques. The relevant disciplines include but are not limited
  to: collaborative work, distributed databases, distributed computing,
  electronic commerce, human-computer interaction, agent technologies
  and multi-agent systems, information retrieval, workflow systems,
  software architectures.
* The CoopIS series provides a forum for well-known researchers, that
  are drawn from the  stature and the tradition of these conference
  series, and has a leading role in shaping the future of the
  cooperative information systems area. Opportunities for informal
  meetings between the conference delegates will be enhanced with a
  series of social events, including  the conference opening, the gala
  dinner, and a guided tour of Trento and dolomites.

CoopIS 2001 is the eighth conference in the series and the sixth
conference organized by the International Foundation on Cooperative
Information Systems (IFCIS). It is sponsored by  the International
Foundation in Cooperative Information Systems (IFCIS), and the
University of Trento.

The conference will be held in Trento, a town situated 190 metres
altitude on the flat ground of the Adige river Valley on the
Verona-Brennero-Innsbruck-Munich motorway and railway. Trento is
surrounded by beautiful mountains and lakes, and it is the ideal town
for few days among museums and expositions, castles and sanctuaries,
wine cellars and typical restaurants, archaeological, historical and
naturalistic journey.

Early Registration Deadline  July 27, 2001
The Conference               September 5-7, 2001
Who should submit papers ?
--------------------------

Papers are solicited in two categories: regular research papers and
industrial experience papers.   The category should be clearly
identified.
* Regular research papers should contain original research concepts
  and results in one or more areas relevant to cooperative information
  systems.
* Industrial experience papers should describe technical or key
  business issues and lessons learned in developing, applying, and
  deploying relevant concepts, highlighting aspects of cooperation and
  interoperation.

Submitted papers should not be longer than 12 pages (about 5000 words)
according to the LNCS Proceedings format (including figures, tables,
references, etc.). Submissions should be unpublished and should not be
under consideration by another conference or journal. A few papers
will be selected for publication, after appropriate expansion and
review, in the International Journal of Cooperative Information
Systems.

This year, the main theme of the conference will be "Architectures and
Methodologies for Effective Web-based Cooperative Information Systems"
and we particularly welcome papers related to this theme. We also
encourage the submission of all topics related to cooperative
information systems, including (but not limited to) the following:

* Agent technologies, systems and architectures
* Web information systems and services
* Middleware technologies for CIS:
   - Distributed object & component technologies
   - Mark-up and semi-structured languages
   - Event-based middleware
* Software architectures for e-Commerce and e-Government
* Benchmarking of cooperative architectures and technologies
* Distributed GIS
* Theoretical and empirical studies on the effectiveness of the CIS
  paradigm for organizations
* Enabling cooperative architectures for BPR
* Business process modeling
* Data Quality in CISs
* Methodologies for development processes of CISs
* Computer-supported cooperative work
* Cooperative transactions
* Distributed problem solving
* Distributed multimedia systems
* Distributed warehousing and mining
* Enterprise knowledge management
* Federated and multi-database systems
* Human-Computer interaction for cooperation
* Information filtering and retrieval
* Information resource discovery
* Data and knowledge modeling
* Mediators and wrappers
