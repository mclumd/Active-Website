Workshop Outline

 The "Semantic Web", a term coined by Tim Berners-Lee, is used to
 denote the next evolution step of the Web. Associating meaning with
 content or establishing a layer of machine understandable data would
 allow automated agents, sophisticated search engines and interoperable
 services, will enable higher degree of automation and more intelligent
 applications. The ultimate goal of the Semantic Web is to allow
machines
 the sharing and exploitation of knowledge in the Web way, i.e. without
 central authority,  with few basic rules, in a scalable, adaptable,
 extensible manner. With RDF as the basic platform for the Semantic Web,

 a multitude of tools, methods and systems have just appeared on the
 horizon. The goal of the workshop is to share experiences about these
 systems, exchange ideas about improvements of existing tools and
 creation of new systems, principles and applications. Also an important

 goal is to develop a cooperation model among Semantic Web developers,
 and to develop a common vision about the future developments.

Relevant workshop topics include (non-exhaustive list):
   <B7> Language and Representation issues
   <B7> Semantic Web infrastructure and architectures
   <B7> Metadata and conceptual models for annotating content, resources,
