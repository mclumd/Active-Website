    We are pleased to invite the submission of extended abstracts for the follow
ing two-day symposium to be held in York next March as part of AISB'01 - the 200
1 Annual Convention of the British Society for the Study of Artificial Intellige
nce and the Simulation of Behaviour.

    The homepage for the symposium is at: <http://srsc.ulb.ac.be/AISB.html>http:

Motivation
*********

This symposium will be devoted to interdisciplinary discussion of
the processes of nonconscious information processing and implicit
learning, in humans and in artificial intelligent agents.  AI systems
with implicit learning capabilities and computational models of implicit
learning will be presented, reflecting cognitive, connectionist and
composite methodologies and paradigms.  A major issue examined will be
the degree of salience that is to be ascribed to the possession of
implicit knowledge and the ability to acquire and employ it through
nonconscious mechanisms exhibited by different classes of
information-processing agents: humans, artificial agents and animals.

    The role of nonconscious information processing in many central
issues of artificial intelligence and the cognitive sciences will be
explored, including but not limited to, representation and inference,
problem-solving, perception, natural language understanding, learning
and induction, creativity and scientific discovery.  Theoretical
contributions, computer simulations and reports of empirical studies
are solicited from researchers in artificial intelligence, cognitive
science, psychology, computer science and philosophy.
