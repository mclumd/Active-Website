The annual ICTAI conference is an international forum for the exchange
of ideas relating to artificial intelligence (AI) among academia,
industry, and government agencies. It fosters the creation and transfer
of such ideas, and promotes their cross-fertilization over all AI
application domains and AI paradigms through a unifying theme: AI Tools.
ICTAI focuses on both theory and developing, implementing, and
evaluating theoretical and applied frameworks that may serve as tools
for developing intelligent systems and pursuing AI applications.

We invite paper submissions that include but are not limited to the 
following topics:
          * AI algorithms 
          * AI in Software Engineering 
          * Cognitive Modeling
