WORKSHOP TOPICS
===============

Information agent technology is one of the major key
technologies for the Internet and worldwide Web. It emerged as a
response to the challenges of the cyberspace from both, the
technological and human user perspective.
Development of information agents requires expertise from different
research disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence (AI),
advanced databases and knowledge base systems, distributed information
systems, information retrieval, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
Like in the previous CIA workshops, all topics in the research area
of intelligent and collaborating information agents are covered by
the CIA-2001 workshop. Topics are but not limited to:

* SYSTEMS and Applications of Information Agents

  - Architectures, prototypes and fielded systems of collaborating information a
gents
    for information discovery and management in the Internet and Web.

* ADAPTATION and Learning Applied to Information Agents

  - Advanced methods for single and multiagent system learning.
  - Performance, relationship and application of multiagent learning
    for collaborating information agents.
  - Self-emerging collaboration among information agents.
  - Computation and action under limited resources.
  - Methods for automated uncertain reasoning for knowledge based
    information agents.
  - Distributed, adaptive Information Retrieval

* MOBILE Information Agents and Issues of Security in the Internet

  - Applications of cooperating mobile information agents in wearable
    computers, hand-held and/or satellite-based control devices
    (WAP-compliant Web handies, communicators, etc.).
  - Architectures, environments and languages for mobile and secure
    performance of information agents and servers.

* RATIONAL Information Agents and Electronic Commerce

  - Virtual Agent-Based Marketplaces, Coalition Formation, Auctions.
  - Electronic Commerce with incomplete and uncertain informations.
  - Economic Models of cooperative problem solving among rational information
    agents in open information environments.
  - Standards for privacy of communication, security, and jurisdiction for
    agent-mediated deals.

* Advanced Database, Information System and Knowledge-Base Technology

  - Application of techniques for Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in
    open, distributed and dynamically changing environments.
  - Management of uncertain and incomplete knowledge for information
    gathering on the Internet or large corporate Intranets.

* Construction and Reuse of Ontologies for Multiagent Information Gathering

* Human-Agent Interaction and Intelligent User Interfaces for Information Agents

  - Synthetic agents, believable avatars, and 3-D multimedia-based
    representation of user information spaces in the Internet.
  - Models and implementation of advanced interfaces for conversation and
    dialogue among information Agents and Users.
  - Dynamic inspection of information agents' work by the user.
