INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION AND REASONING (TIME-01)
  Call for Papers
  June 14-16, 2001
  Cividale del Friuli, Italy
  http://tizero.usr.dsi.unimi.it/~time-01/
* The purpose of this symposium is to bring together active
  researchers in different research areas involving time
  representation and reasoning. Research papers on the related topic
  of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning are also
  welcome.  Traditionally, most contributions came from the Artificial
  Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other
  areas such as Temporal/Spatial Databases and Temporal Logics has
  been increasing in the last years. We especially encourage
  submissions from these areas in order to achieve a
  multi-disciplinary perspective of the topic and to benefit from
  cross-fertilization of ideas.
* The symposium is planned as a three days event, and it will be
  conducted as a combination of paper presentations, an extended
  poster session, a panel session and two invited talks.
* There are three tracks in the Symposium with separate program
  committees. 
  Track1: Temporal Representation and Reasoning in AI
  Track 2: Time Management in Databases
  Track 3: Temporal Logic in Computer Science
* Important Dates:
  Paper Submission Deadline: February 2, 2001
  Notification of Acceptance: April 2, 2001
  Camera Ready Copy Due: April 15, 2001
