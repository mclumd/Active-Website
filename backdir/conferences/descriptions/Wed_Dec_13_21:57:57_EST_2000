WORKSHOP ON INCONSISTENCY IN DATA AND KNOWLEDGE
  Affilliated with IJCAI'01 
  Call for Papers
  Seattle, August 6th, 2001
  http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~chomicki/inconsistency01.html
* Theme: The problem of reasoning in the presence of inconsistency has
  been studied by the mathematical logic community for some
  decades. Nevertheless, new challenges, problems and issues have
  appeared in the context of knowledge representation in AI, database
  systems, formal specifications and other areas of computer
  science. The main goal of this workshop is to identify new
  inconsistency-related problems of conceptual and practical
  significance, and the ways they are handled in different
  contexts. The workshop is expected to bring together people from
  different research communities (knowledge representation, databases,
  formal specifications, mathematical and philosophical logic) that
  are actively pursuing the issue of inconsistency.
  - Inconsistency handling: prevention, detection, resolution
  - Causes of inconsistency   - Reasoning in the presence of inconsistency
  - Inconsistency in non-classical logics and argumentation systems
  - Inconsistency in databases   - Integrity Constraints
  - Information fusion       - Data reconciliation and cleaning
  - Inconsistency and belief revision/update
  - Action conflicts and their resolution
  - Inconsistency in formal specifications   - Implementation issues
