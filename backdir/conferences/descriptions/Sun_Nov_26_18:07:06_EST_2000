This interdisciplinary conference has drawn about 300 people from around
the world each time that it has been offered. Last year's conference was
attended by scientists from 28 countries. The conference is structured to
facilitate intense communication between its participants, both in the
formal sessions and during its other activities. As during previous years,
the conference will focus on solutions to the fundamental questions:

How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence?

The conference will include invited tutorials and lectures, and
contributed lectures and posters by experts on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to 
a changing world. The conference is aimed at researchers and students 
of computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science,
artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial
intelligence.

A single oral or poster session enables all presented work to be
highly visible.

Abstract submissions encourage submissions of the latest results.

Costs are kept at a minimum without compromising the quality of
meeting handouts and social events.
