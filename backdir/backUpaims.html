<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Common
sense in a computer is a bit hard to define, but the idea we are aiming at is
comparable to human-level common sense (often understood as distinct from
expert or special cleverness).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For
instance, solving the mutilated checkerboard problem takes a special clever
insight, and thus is *not* what we have in mind. But note that much of the AI
community would not draw the definitional lines as we have; for that reason, we
sometimes use the expression ``cognitive adequacy'' to refer to our
conception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is intended to suggest
a kind of general-purpose reasoning ability that will serve the agent to ``get
along'' (learning as it goes) in a wide and unpredicted range of
environments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consequently, one
hallmark of common sense is the ability to recognize, and initiate appropriate
responses to, novelty, error, and confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Examples of such responses include learning from mistakes, aligning
action with reasoning and vice versa, and seeking (and taking) advice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>A
closely related hallmark is the ability to reason about anything whatever (that
is brought to one's attention). This does not mean being clever about it, or
knowing much about it, or being able to draw significant conclusions; it can
mean as little as realizing that the topic is not understood, asking for more
information, and learning appropriately from whatever advice is given.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That might seem like very little, if our aim
were to have clever solutions to tricky problems. But consider this: virtually
no AI programs exhibit even that ``little'' amount of elementary common sense;
they are not able to know when they are confused, let alone seek -- and use --
clarifying data. On the other hand, cleverness -- in highly limited domains and
for tightly specified representations -- has been built into many programs, a
kind of ``idiot savantry'' that fails utterly when outside those narrow
strictures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>One
large piece of what is needed for cognitive adequacy, then, is what we call
``perturbation tolerance'': the ability to keep going adequately when subjected
to unanticipated changes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This includes
changes to the knowledge base (KB); e.g.~the changes might introduce
inconsistencies, or make a goal impossible or ambiguous. Worse, the knowledge
representation (KR) system might change (new terms, new meanings for old terms,
different notational conventions, etc), especially if other agents are
involved; and of course there are typos (missing parentheses and the like) that
appear to defy any prearranged methodology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And there are changes to physical sensors and effectors, and how things
in the world work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Then
what is it to ``keep going adequately'' in the face of such changes?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among other things, this will require (i)
never ``hanging'' or ``breaking''; (ii) recognizing when there is a difficulty
to be addressed; (iii) making an assessment of options to deal with the
difficulty; (iv) choosing and putting an option into action.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such a suite of abilities will require
keeping track of one's own history of activity, including one's own past
reasoning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such an agent will then, in
Nilsson's phrase, have a *lifetime of its own*, and keeping track of its own
processes and history will allow it to look back at what it is doing and use
that knowledge to guide its upcoming behavior. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>People
tend to do this well. Is this ability an evolutionary hodgepodge, a holistic
amalgam of countless parts with little or no intelligible structure? Or might
there be some few key modular features that provide this ``adequacy''?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We think there is strong evidence for the
latter, and we have a specific hypothesis about it and how to build it in a
computer. In a nutshell, we propose what we call the metacognitive loop (MCL)
as the essential distinguishing feature of commonsense reasoning. And we claim
that the state of the art is very nearly where it needs to be, to allow this to
be designed and implemented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Our
postulated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>&quot;metacognitive
loop&quot; -- in both human and machine commonsense reasoning -- allows humans
(and should allow machines) to function effectively in novel situations, by
noting errors and adopting strategies for dealing with them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The loop has three main steps: (i) monitor
events for a possible anomaly, (ii) assess its type and possible stategies for
dealing with it, and (iii) guide one or more strategies into place while
continuing to monitor (looping back to step i) for new anomalies that may arise
either as part of the strategy underway or otherwise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>People
clearly use something very like MCL to keep an even keel in the face of a
confusing, shifting world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is an
obvious no-brainer, at the level of individual personal experience: we often
notice things amiss and take appropriate action. In addition there is empirical
evidence for this in studies of human learning strategies, where, for instance,
an individual tasked with memorizing a list of foreign-language word-meaning
pairs will make judgments of relative difficulty along the way, in framing
study strategies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
suspect that MCL is profoundly involved in many human behaviors well beyond
formal learning situations, and that there is a specialized MCL module that
carries out such activity on a nearly continual basis, without which we would
be everyday incompetents -- although perhaps idiot savants -- as opposed to
everyday commonsense reasoners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, while we are interested in gathering additional information
about MCL behaviors in humans, our main focus is on taking this as
motivation for building a similar capability into
computers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>A major
application domain that we are using in this work is natural language
human-computer dialog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Errors of
miscommunication are prevalent in dialog, especially human-computer dialog.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our work to date has indicated that
something analogous to our loop not only is active in human dialog but also can
be a powerful tool for automated systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One example is the learning of new words: if a word is used that the
system does not know, this can be processed as an anomaly, which in turn can
trigger various stategies including asking for help (&quot;What does that word
mean?&quot;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other examples include
disambiguations, and appropriate retraction of implicatures and
presuppositions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The long-range aim is
a computer system that, via dialog with humans, learns a much larger vocabulary
in the process of noting and correcting its misunderstandings, akin to a
foreigner learning a new language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
