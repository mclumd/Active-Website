Subject: New electronic mailing list for Philosophy and Psychology
Sender: spp-request@umiacs.UMD.EDU

Greetings from the new electronic mailing list of the Society for 
Psychology and Philosophy (SPP). The list has been created, and is being
maintained, under the auspices of the University of Maryland Institute
for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) in College Park, Maryland. Included
in the list are the names and email addresses not only of various members
of the SPP, but also a large selection of names of persons whose email
addresses were available to us at the time the list was created, and whom
we suspected would be interested.

The purpose of the mailing list is to facilitate communication among the
rather large international group of persons interested in the cognitive
sciences. The mailing list is easy to use. However, it is NOT for
casual chit-chat; the latter is better served by bulletin-boards and/or
direct personal email to particular individuals. Here are some pointers:

(1) SENDING MAIL.  To send a message to *every* member of the list simply
send electronic mail as usual, to the address: spp@umiacs.umd.edu

We have found that, on occasion, if there are further addressees
(in addition to spp@umiacs.umd.edu) in your message header, it
may fail to get through. Thus to send your message not only to the
spp list but also to, say, X, Y, and Z, we suggest that you:
(a) send the message to spp@umiacs.umd.edu alone, and then 
(b) send it a second time but to X, Y, and Z; this also applies to
copies, if your mailer has the copy feature.

(2) WHEN SHOULD I USE THE LIST?  Sensible uses of mailing to
spp@umiacs.umd.edu would include: disseminating information about
major events of interest to Cognitive Science in general, or to SPP
members in particular (such as the annual meeting of the Society for
Philosophy and Psychology). It is NOT sensible to use the for
ongoing debate about controversial issues, for probably only a tiny
fraction of the persons who will receive the messages will be interested.
In other words, announcements yes, arguments no. Remember, the list goes
to hundreds of people around the world, who, like you, are very busy.

(3) REPLYING TO MAIL. To reply to a message sent to the entire list, first
think carefully whether you really want *everyone* on the list to get your
reply, including the hundereds at other institutions, most of whom you
probably do not know.  If you want to communicate just to a few people, it
is *much* better to send email directly to them instead, and not to bother
everyone else.  [Note that in many mailer systems the standard way to
reply to a message automatically replies to every recipient of the
original message and not just to the author; please take the trouble to
learn about your own mail system. Also, the same observation about multiple
addressees in (1) above applies to replies as well.]

(4) WHO IS ON THE LIST?  A current copy of the entire mailing list appears
at the end of this message.  By looking through this copy, you can see who
will currently receive the messages you send to the list.  Since the
attached copy also includes email addresses, you can use it to construct
more select mailing lists of your own.  

(5) CHANGING THE LIST.  To request changes in the list (to ask that your
name be added or deleted, to change your address, etc.), please send email,
explaining what you want, to the address: spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu.
Do *not* send such requests to sppi@umiacs.umd.edu, *nor* to the below-
named maintainer of the list. Be sure to tell us all we need to know; 
if you are requesting a new entry, we need your name, your affiliation,
and your email address. See the current list below for examples.

(6) ANY QUESTIONS?  If you have questions about any of this, please send
them to the address spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu (not to spp@umiacs.umd.edu).
Again, the spp@umiacs.umd.edu address is only for sending to the entire list
of names; and the spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu is for contacting the maintainers
of the list only.

This is a last ditch attempt to get some input from the people who study
language and learning into the American Association for Artificial Intelligence,
Spring Symposium Series, Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology
(AAAI SSS MLNLO) symposium to be held in Stanford in March.

The call went out months ago and closed recently.  As an AI based committee
and a AAAI event the AI community was saturated with information, and now that
submissions to present or participate are in, it we have about 40 AI researchers
and circa 0 Linguists, 0 Psycholinguists, 0 Philosophers and 0 Neurologists.

The committee is concerned that we should not be tackling the subject of
MLNLO without some input from those whose research should provide the
theoretical basis for ours.  Some of us are quite happy to present OUR
interpretations of YOUR research, but we'd rather you do it.

I enclose the call below.  As I mentioned, general submissions have closed.
In mid-December we will issue our invitations to present and attend.  After
that AAAI will fill up the symposium to 65 with general AI types.  We
cannot offer support to bring big names, but we will hold open chair/intro
spots for various areas until the last minute in the hope that we might get
a real Linguist, Psycholinguist or whoever to present first hand accounts
of their fields.

Please let me know of your interest ASAP.

The call follows (and a background paper can also be sent on request -
either in troff format or plain ASCII).  Please reply to

       Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology
      March 26-28 1991 - AAAI Spring Symposium - Stanford

Over the last thirty years there has been a trickle of papers addressing
aspects of the Natural Language Learning area.  The 80s have even seen a
few books published on the subject.  These have tended to take drastically
different theoretical approaches, and have drawn on varying degrees on
fields outside Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

During this same period, computational and mathematical modelling of language
and learning have increasingly been recognized as relevant to assessing the
validity of a theory of Language Acquisition or the Nature of Language.
Conversely, researchers in Linguistics, Psycholinguistics and Philosophy,
as well as Computing, have been considering how and where we can apply
our increasing knowledge of the human characteristics and constraints which
determine how we solve problems, learn about the world, and use language.

The symposium will address all aspects of the relationship between 
Machine Learning and Natural Language.  We not only expect input from 
researchers in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (Machine 
Learning, Natural Language, Robotics, Vision, Neural Nets, 
Parallelism, etc.) but wish particularly to encourage relevant
contributions from other fields (Linguistics, Psycholinguistics,
Philosophy, Neurology, Mathematics, etc.)

Specific areas of interest include:

Traditional Approaches
- Applicability of traditional machine learning.
- Applicability of traditional parsing techniques.

Complexity Theory 
- Formal results on learning and language constraints.
- Development of effective classifications of language.

Cognitive Science
- Psychological results on language and restrictions.
- Linguistic results on the nature of natural language.

Parallel Networks
- Neural models of parsing and learning.
- Parallel models of parsing and learning.

Symbol Grounding
- Grounding of Natural Language Systems.
- Interaction between Modalities and Learning of Ontology.

System Development
- Computable hypotheses and heuristics for language learning.
- Experimental language learning systems and their rationale.


Prospective participants are encouraged to contact a member of the
symposium committee to obtain a more detailed description of the symposium
goals and issues.  Participants should then submit an extended
abstract of a paper (500-1000 words) and/or a personal bio-history of
work in the area (300-500 words) with a list of (up to 12) relevant
publications.

We will acknowledge your e-mail enquiries or submissions promptly, and
will deal with other forms of communication as quickly as possible.

Submissions should be sent by e-mail to powers=sub@informatik.uni-kl.de
(and/or reeker@cs.ida.org) by November 16th.  If e-mail is impossible, two
copies should be sent to arrive by November 16th to:

    Larry Reeker, Institute for Defense Analyses, C & SE Div.,

                         LOGIC MEETING AT UCLA

                         January 25 - 27, 1991

There will be a very informal gathering of logicians at UCLA, starting
with lunch at 12:00 noon on Friday, January 25 and ending in the
afternoon of Sunday January 27.  In accordance with the informal nature
of the meeting, there will be few formal talks and plenty of time for
discussion; the formal part of the program includes invited lectures
by  R. Dougherty,  K. Fine,  L. Harrington,  M. Laskowski,  L. Moss
and  B. Velickovic, as well as a session with contributed papers and
problems.

                          EVERYONE IS INVITED

This first announcement is being sent to a small number of persons on a
hastily contrived mailing list, so please mention the meeting to your
friends who might be interested in coming. If you plan to come, drop
Yiannis Moschovakis a note, e-mail or telephone message; you will be
listed then in the final announcement which will be mailed out by
January 10, 1991.

It is advisable to make early hotel reservations, as the situation can
get tight around UCLA.  We have alerted the following three hotels of
the meeting:

Claremont, 1044 Tiverton  Ave., (213) 208 5957,
Royal Palace,  1052  Tiverton Ave.,  (213) 208 6677,
Holiday Inn - Brentwood, 170 North Church Lane, (213) 476 6411x1618.

The first two of these are closer than the third, but the third has
better prices, if you call the complete number with the extension.
Please make your own reservations, mentioning the UCLA Logic meeting.

NEH SUMMER SEMINARS FOR COLLEGE TEACHERS
MENTAL REPRESENTATION
ROBERT CUMMINS, DIRECTOR
University of Arizona, June 10 - August 2

ABOUT THE SEMINAR
	This seminar is designed to provide a collegial setting in which
to study and discuss the topic of mental representation, one of the
"hottest" topics in current philosophy and cognitive science.  The
correlative notions of representation and computation are important both
for their role as the central descriptive and explanatory primitives in
contemporary cognitive science and because the best available scientific
hypothesis suggests that our deepest questions about ourselves--what
thought is and how it is possible in a physical medium like our
brains--will be answered by appeal to them.  The course will be divided
into three sections: (i) a critical survey of current philosophical
accounts of mental representation, (ii) a survey of the historical
antecedents of these accounts, and (iii) an examination of the uses made
of mental representation in contemporary cognitive scientific theory. 
The third part of the seminar will include, as much as possible, local
scientists and research projects to provide direct exposure to how
cognitive science actually exploits mental representation. 
Specifically, participants will be exposed to pursuits in AI,
psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and connectionist modeling. 

ABOUT THE DIRECTOR
	Robert Cummins holds a joint position in Philosophy and
Cognitive Science at the University of Arizona.  He has been
continuously engaged in research into the nature of computational
modeling and its role in psychological explanation since 1969.  This
research is complemented by his work in the history of modern
philosophy, in which he shows how to understand seventeenth and
eighteenth century texts from the perspective of cognitive science.  A
substantial part of his research efforts for the past five years have
been devoted to constructing computational models--including
connectionist models--rather than merely philosophizing about them. 
	Professor Cummins is the author of Meaning and mental
representation (1989) and The nature of psychological explanation
(1983), as well as numerous articles. 

EXPECTATIONS OF PARTICIPANTS
	The eight-week seminar will include three meetings a week, each
about two hours.  Participants may either have a major project already
in hand to pursue in conjunction with the seminar, or may instead choose
to write some short (about 5 pages) "position papers," which may help to
focus ideas for future publication. 

LOCATION AND FACILITIES
	The University of Arizona Philosophy Department is one of the
strongest in the country, with six senior, nationally recognized faculty
members involved in research bearing on the philosophy of mind and
cognitive science.  All are members of the university's
interdisciplinary Cognitive Science group, making the environment one of
fruitful exchange with researchers in psychology, linguistics and AI. 
	Seminar participants, who will receive a stipend of $3750, will
be housed together in a local apartment complex, in furnished apartments
with kitchens, on a direct bus-line to campus.  It is hope this
arrangement will maximize interaction among participants. 

Contact Robert Cummins, University of Arizona, Philosophy Department;
Tucson, AZ 85721 (602) 621-7102.  Application Deadline: March 1, 1991. 
Applicants notified March 28.

Subject: protocol for using the SPP Electronic Mailing List
Sender: spp-request@umiacs.UMD.EDU

Numerous people over the past few months have requested
that they be added to the new SPP Electronic Mailing List.
However, in several cases, these requests have gone to the
wrong email address. They SHOULD go to a special address
set up precisely for this purpose. The CORRECT REQUEST ADDRESS 
is:

	  spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu

Instead, requests have been sent to the main spp list itself,
meaning that each request then automatically is distributed
to the entire list (hundreds of people). This can quickly
become a major nuisance. Please, when you tell your friends
about the list, tell them the CORRECT way to send add-me
requests. Do NOT tell them to send email to spp@umiacs.umd.edu--
this is the DISTRIBUTION address, for use ONLY when sending
messages to be read by everyone on the list (e.g., announcements).

Add-me requests or any other matter for intended only for the
list maintainers should NOT go to the spp@umiacs.umd.edu address, 
but rather to spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu, as noted above.

Thanks,
Don Perlis

Thank you for the multiple copies of your explanation of why my mailbox is
filling up with messages about getting put on the spp mailing list. The
explanation arrived along with several more such requests.

This epidemic of unwanted email may be due to a misunderstanding about where to
send a request to be on the mailing list.  But it is nonethless not only a
serious bug but a gross misuse of the Internet.  Nobody should be allowed to 
mail to an address which then -- without human editorial intervention --
disseminates mail to hundreds of people.  The internet is not a free and open
road.  It not only costs universities real money, but its use in this way
constitutes an invasion of privacy.  Your clarification as to why this latest
waste of time and happened misses the point, which is that nobody's address 
has any business being on an omnibus mailing list without their permission.  

We are in the midst of a junk email epidemic:  I get over 10 unwanted emails 
every day.  It appears that the only way to keep being innunadated with such 
mail may be to return each one to the sender.

ABSTRACT: Different explanations of color vision favor different
philosophical positions: Computational vision is more compatible with
objectivism (the color is in the object), psychophysics and
neurophysiology with subjectivism (the color is in the head).
Comparative research suggests that an explanation of color must be both
experientialist (unlike objectivism) and ecological (unlike
subjectivism). Computational vision's emphasis on optimally
"recovering" prespecified features of the environment (i.e., distal
properties, independent of the sensory-motor capacities of the animal)
is unsatisfactory. Conceiving of visual perception instead as the
visual guidance of activity in an environment that is determined
largely by that very activity suggests new directions for research.

Keywords: adaptation, color vision, comparative vision, computation,
evolution, ecological optics, objectivism, ontology, qualia, sensory
physiology, subjectivism.

The Second International Workshop on Human & Machine Cognition
Topic:  Android Epistemology
Eden Condominium @ Perdido Key, Florida
May 9 - 11, 1991

Call for Papers

Robotics is a new technology which has revolutionized many
industries: robots build cars, assemble watches and computers, and
cooperate in large-scale construction work.  Soon, cars may actually be
robots.  This industrial revolution has reawakened interest in many
old philosophical questions about the nature of the mental and its
relation to the world -- as well as some new ones about what kind of
mental states (if any) of a robot can be said to constitute knowledge of
the world.

What could it mean for a robot to know about its world?  This question
raises issues in many disciplines.  Its roots are in psychology, but it has
involved areas ranging from electrical engineering to philosophy, and
from computer science to sociology.  One theme which emerged from
the last 25 years of AI work, and is once again controversial, is the idea
of knowledge taking the form of internal representations.  To what
extent can knowledge be thought of as sentences in an internal
language of thought?  Or should it rather be seen as an essentially
biological, or essentially social, phenomenon?  Can a machine be said
to have intentional states, or are all meanings of internal machine
representations essentially rooted in human interpretations of them?
These questions, and others, have come back into center stage in the
last few years.  This workshop will be useful in bringing together
proponents of these various perspectives for a focused exchange of
ideas that may lead to progress through increased interdisciplinary
cooperation.

Topics include:
		Beliefs, Desires, IntentionsE
		How can a robot know about its environment?
		Indexicality in knowledge representation
		How can robots and humans share knowledge?
		Non-Deductive Modes of Inference
		Artificial Ethical Reasoners?
		Realist vs. Constructivist Approaches to AI
		Robot Communities
		Can artificial reasoners act as vehicles for knowledge transfer
		between humans?


The workshop will be kept small -- about 40 participants.  In general,
attendance will be limited to those presenting their work -- one author
per paper.  The contribution of each presenter will be considered for
publication as a chapter in a subsequent edited volume.  This book will
be the second in a series named, Advances in Human and Machine
Cognition, published by JAI Press, Greenwich, CT.  The first volume in
this series, Reasoning Agents in a Dynamic World: The Frame
Problem, edited by K. Ford and P. Hayes, will be available in June 1991.

Travel grants (approximately $500.00) will be available to a small
number of graduate students with accepted papers and other
participants without institutional travel support.  Those wishing to
attend the workshop should send three copies of an extended abstract
(from 5 to 8 pages) to Ken Ford (address below) before February 28, 1991.

The workshop site is at the Eden Condominium on Perdido Key.  This
serene and beautiful setting is conducive to the free exchange of ideas
and is ideally suited to such a gathering.  Pensacola Regional Airport
offers convenient air transportation from most locations.

DISCUSSION
.ft

.fi
The aim of the MLNLO symposium is to encourage interaction and promote
discussion amongst Language and Learning researchers. With this in
mind, in addition to the usual long talks, we have included a
similar number of short spots
which allow people to introduce themselves, their work and their
groups.  The long talks are a nominal 30 mins and the spots 10 mins.

These times include a few minutes for questions and discussion, as
usual, but additional time is allowed at the end of each session
for general discussion.  As this discussion is not intended to be
limited to the current session, but may allow picking up and
relating of earlier themes, increasing amounts of discussion time
are allowed as the day wears on, and as the days roll by.

As we are not running parallel session, chairmen also have the
freedom to allow discussion to continue following a particularly
provocative presentation, taking into account the additional
discussion time in that session.  For this reason precise times for
talks are not shown in this programme.

		          CALL FOR PAPERS

		      Natural Language Learning
	      August 25 1991 - IJCAI Workshop - Sydney


Machine Learning and Natural Language are two areas of Artificial
Intelligence which not only overlap with each other, but with other
significant areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science.

The focus of this workshop is computational language learning
models.  Primarily, we aim to bring together those who have
implemented language learning models, or aspects thereof.  However,
we intend that computationally viable language learning theories
developed by Linguists and Psycholinguists will also be examined at
the workshop.  In addition, Machine Learning or Natural Language
research which has not specifically been undertaken from a language
learning perspective may be considered relevant - in particular, for
example, work in Concept Learning and Semantic Representation.

Thus we wish to invite applications from all who have implemented
language learning programs, and we will further encourage
participation from those whose work could be of use in the
implementation of language learning systems.

A major goal will be the analysis of the various language
learning models to allow comparison and contrasting of the
theoretical perspective and hypotheses embodied, the implementation
techniques and learning algorithms, and the implications of the
virtues, failings and results of particular implementations and
modelling experiments.

Attendance will be by invitation, and the number of participants
will be strictly limited, probably to 35.  It will be necessary to
charge a fee of $65 for each participant.


Issues
------

What technology and ideas can be imported into Natural Language
Learning from other areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive
Science?

Which phenomena, hypotheses and theories have been modelled, tested
or used in Natural Language Learning, and with what success?

To what extent do results in Natural Language Learning suggest the
need for a revision of Formal Language, Linguistic, Neural Network
and Psycholinguistic theory and application?

How broadly must we define Natural Language Learning - in particular,
do we need to learn simultaneously interpretation of both the symbolic
and grounded modalities?


Possible Sessions
-------- --------

The issues above suggest that the workshop could be organized into
sessions along the following lines:

Psycholinguistic Models
Learning Algorithms
Complexity & Restriction
Semantics & Representation

The final program will of course reflect the distribution of the
submissions received, and other issues may also be highlighted.

Accomodations:  Lodging is available at reasonable rates at two
on campus locations.  Both the Guest Center (hotel-like) and the
Residence Halls (shared bath) are very near the Conference
Center.  Accomodations are available only in a complete package
which includes 4 nights lodging (begining night of June 8) and
breakfast and lunch each day of the conference. Rates are given
on the Reservation Form (below).

Limited availability for the Guest Center, so reservations will
be taken in order received. (If you request the Guest Center and
end up booked in the Residence Hall, the difference will be
refunded at registration.)

Please note that the SPP must supply SFSU with a guest list and
full payment 30 days in advance to hold reservations. So please
send your reservation and payment ASAP and by April 30 at the
latest.

Doubles can not be reserved until both persons register.

STAYING ON:  If you want to stay in SF for a few extra days,
space should be available.  Please indicate such an interest on
the registration form.

ARRIVAL:  Check in time:  after 3:00 PM Sat. June 8
(On Saturday 6/8  only - come to lounge of Verducci Hall, the
only SFSU building on Lake Merced Boulevard.  On other days
registration will be at Conference Center)

         Check out time:  2:00 PM Wed. June 12

CHILDREN:  Unfortunately insurance provisions do not permit
children in SFSU lodging.

Hi,

	No doubt it is because the request went to the spp list instead of
the spp-request list. You, as well as everyone else on the spp list is
reached when requests get sent to it whereas only the list maintainer is
reached when the spp-request list is sent to. 

	Addition and deletion requests should be sent to spp-request@umiacs.

Tah.

Calm down, everyone...a few people are sending their requests, not to you,
Georges, but to EVERYONE! Such requests are supposed to go to
	spp-request@umiacs
but instead are being mailed to
	spp@umiacs

This is the problem that arose a few months ago, probably due to someone's
announcing to the whole world that spp@umiacs was the place to send
requests. In fact, YOUR ANSWER also went to the whole world...

We are working on a more permanent solution to this...please bear

Don, I have also complained about this problem some months ago.  Changing the
name of the mailing list from SPP (which is surely the obvious name for the society's mailbox rather than a mailing list) will not solve the basic problem
which is email garbage flooding the Internet.  There is no excuse for there
being a publically accessible mailing list which can be used without special
permission (in this case from at least an officer of the SPP or its editor).
Publically accessible mailing lists are an even greater evil in email than they
are in regular mail because we are all paying for the use of a limited
bandwidth resource.  SPP should certainly not be in the business of providing
an electronic mailing list to anyone who knows the alias of the list.

This is being distributed to the list so others who feel as I do can make
their annoyance heard.  If you dissagree with me I suggest you raise it
before the SPP board or the agency who supports your Internet access costs.

---- Zenon Pylyshyn

PS Please take my name off the list WHATEVER its name and authorization for
use.  Also since I receive several copies of everything, it seems to be on 
twice or three times so please erase all occurences of it.

This is to announce the availability of the latest version of my bibliography
of recent work in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of cognitive science,
and philosophy of AI.  The original version was distributed about 6 months
ago over various mailing lists (though not this one).  Since then it's been
expanded, reorganized and updated.  It currently consists of 946 entries,
divided into 4 parts:

1. Consciousness and Qualia                           [226 entries]
2. Mental Content and Psychological Explanation       [348 entries]
3. Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence              [186 entries]
4. Miscellaneous Topics                               [186 entries]

About 60% of the entries are annotated with a 1-or-2-line summary, and
occasionally criticism.  The rest I either haven't read, or haven't got
around to annotating yet.  Of course none of the parts are complete, but
part 4 is particularly feeble, without any attempt at thoroughly covering
the areas involved.    The vast bulk of the bibliography consists of papers
and books from the last 10-15 years, although a little earlier material is
included where it is directly relevant to current concerns.

I've enclosed a section-by-section summary below.  To get a copy, write to
me at dave@cogsci.indiana.edu.  The files take up about 150K in total, and
are available by either e-mail or ftp.

Dear spp member,a 
I am working on a project on the relationships between chaos theory
and the philosophy of mind.  I am especially interested in chaos
and higher level cognition, such and language and problem solving.
My guess is that there is not much available, But I'd love to be 
wrong.  Can anyone help me?  I know about work by Freeman (Skarda and Freeman 
in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, for example), and also stuff by Jordan
Pollock and Tim van Gelder.  Any ohter ideas would be most helpful.

Natural Language Learning
.c
August 25 1991 - IJCAI Workshop - Sydney

Machine Learning and Natural Language are two areas of Artificial
Intelligence which not only overlap with each other, but with other
significant areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science.

The focus of this workshop is computational language learning
models.  Primarily, we aim to bring together those who have
implemented language learning models, or aspects thereof.  However,
we intend that computationally viable language learning theories
developed by Linguists and Psycholinguists will also be examined at
the workshop.  In addition, Machine Learning or Natural Language
research which has not specifically been undertaken from a language
learning perspective may be considered relevant - in particular, for
example, work in Concept Learning and Semantic Representation.

Thus we wish to invite applications from all who have implemented
language learning programs, and we will further encourage
participation from those whose work could be of use in the
implementation of language learning systems.

A major goal will be the analysis of the various language
learning models to allow comparison and contrasting of the
theoretical perspective and hypotheses embodied, the implementation
techniques and learning algorithms, and the implications of the
virtues, failings and results of particular implementations and
modelling experiments.

Attendance will be by invitation, and the number of participants
will be strictly limited, probably to 35.  It will be necessary to
charge a fee of $65 for each participant.


Issues
------

What technology and ideas can be imported into Natural Language
Learning from other areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive
Science?

Which phenomena, hypotheses and theories have been modelled, tested
or used in Natural Language Learning, and with what success?

To what extent do results in Natural Language Learning suggest the
need for a revision of Formal Language, Linguistic, Neural Network
and Psycholinguistic theory and application?

How broadly must we define Natural Language Learning - in particular,
do we need to learn simultaneously interpretation of both the symbolic
and grounded modalities?


Possible Sessions
-------- --------

The issues above suggest that the workshop could be organized into
sessions along the following lines:

Psycholinguistic Models
Learning Algorithms
Complexity & Restriction
Semantics & Representation

The final program will of course reflect the distribution of the
submissions received, and other issues may also be highlighted.

                            SYMPOSIUM ON
           ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, REASONING AND CREATIVITY

                          20-23 AUGUST 1991
                      immediately preceding the
       International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
                             (IJCAI'91)

                            organised by
               GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA

                            to be held at
            LAMINGTON NATIONAL PARK, QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA


Creativity is one of the least understood aspects of intelligence.  It is
commonly regarded as `intuitive' and not susceptible to rational enquiry.
However, there is now considerable work in artificial intelligence and
cognitive science which addresses creativity.  This symposium will provide a
forum for exploring and discussing these ideas, and for suggesting directions
for future research.  It aims to attract practitioners of both 'cognitive'
and `technological' artificial intelligence.
	The symposium calls for extended abstracts of 750-1000 words. The
following are suggested areas only:
    - models of creativity
    - modelling creative processes
    - creative reasoning, e.g theory generation in science
    - analogical reasoning
    - case-based reasoning
    - nonmonotonic reasoning
    - thought experiments
Both connectionist and traditional symbolic approaches are welcome.
All abstracts will be refereed. Accepted extended abstracts will be 
printed in the form of Preprints and be available for distribution
at the time of registration. Accepted papers will be subjected to a
further refereeing process for publication by Kluwer Academic Publishers.

KEYNOTE SPEAKER - PROFESSOR MARGARET BODEN
Margaret Boden, in her talk on `Creativity and Computers', will discuss
how computational concepts drawn from artificial intelligence can explore
creativity. Computers can sometimes do apparently creative things;
more to the point, they can suggest how we manage to do so. Computational
ideas are therefore helping us to understand how human originality is
possible.
	Margaret Boden is Professor of Philosophy and Psychology, and Founding

LOCATION
The symposium is being held at O'Reillys Lodge in Lamington National Park,
Queensland - a rainforest 120 km south of Brisbane. Rainforests vary from the
temperate beech forest of the higher altitudes to the warm subtropical
rainforest of the valleys. There is an abundance of rare and spectacular
plants (orchids, ferns, giant epiphytes, mosses, luminous fungi) and a diverse
community of birds and animals (crimson rosellas, king parrots, bower birds,
miniature kangaroos, brush turkeys) all coexisting beneath the lofty
rainforest canopy. O'Reillys is a mountain resort of modern units. 
The seminar facilities are highly professional, including lecture theatre, 
audiovisual equipment and library.

                   C A L L   FOR  P A P E R S

                    PRAGMATICS AND COGNITION

Editor:

Marcelo Dascal, Philosophy, Tel Aviv University (Israel)

Associate Editors:

Jens Allwood, Linguistics, University of Gothenburg (Sweden)

Benny Shanon, Psychology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel)



Stephen Stich, Cognitive Science, Rutgers University (U.S.A.)

Yorick Wilks, Computer Science, New Nexico State University

Assistant Editors: Itiel Dror, Edson Francozo, Amir Horowitz

Publisher: John Benjamins, B.V. (Amsterdam)



Purpose and Scope:

A new journal, especially an interdisciplinary one, helps to
shape a new research niche, carved out by a critical mass of work


already in the making, but which has not so far found an adequate


vehicle of diffusion and crystallization. The niche PRAGMATICS
AND COGNITION has identified, and purports to develop, lies at

the intersection between two rapidly  expanding areas of
research: pragmatics and cognitive science.

Each of these disciplines is concerned with one of the two most

important kinds of (human) activity -- the use of symbols and the


performance of mental operations. Though the interdependence
between these activities has been often asserted and discussed,
it has not so far received the kind of systematic attention and
specific research it well deserves. Pragmatics has been mostly
concerned with accounting for the communicative use of language
and other semiotic systems, taking for granted (or simply
ignoring) its mental underpinnings. Cognitive Science has been
mainly concerned either with the grand issue of mental
architecture or with detailed analyses of certain mental
processes, without focusing on their pragmatic aspects. But
researchers in both areas have again and again stumbled against
the need for interrelating systematically semiotic and mental
activity, and they have quite often developed fruitful ideas on
how to go about doing it. It is this body of research and ideas
that PRAGMATICS AND COGNITION seeks to foster, by creating a
dedicated space for its critical discussion and development.
PRAGMATICS AND COGNITION is interested in the interrelations
between the use of any semiotic system by any being and that
being's `inner life'. Its scope covers a wide variety of semiotic


systems (natural languages, computer languages, writing, gesture,


facial expression, etc.), as used by humans, animals and
machines, in connection with a broad range of `mental' activities


(pattern recognition, problem solving, sensation, emotion,
fantasy, interpretation of experience, hallucination, dreaming,
understanding, humor, creativity, mental modeling,
conceptualization, aesthetic pleasure, etc.). The journal seeks
to explore relations of all sorts between the former and the
latter: logical and causal dependence; conditions of acquisition,


development or loss; modeling, simulation and formalization;
shared or separate biological and neurological basis; social and

cultural variation; aesthetic expression; historical development;


etc.

It goes without saying that, given its scope, PRAGMATICS AND
COGNITION must be an interdisciplinary journal. Among the
disciplines whose separate paths it seeks to bring together,
Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, Semiotics, Cognitive
Science, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, Ethology, and
Cognitive Anthropology. But this is not, of course, an exhaustive


list. Contributions steming from any discipline, relevant to the

editorial interests of the journal are welcome.

Technical information:

Initially the journal will be published twice a year (in May and


November). Each volume will contain approximately 400 pages. The


first issue is scheduled for May 1992.

Authors should send 4 copies of manuscripts, in English, to the
Editor. Only original manuscripts, not yet published elsewhere
nor under consideration for publication  elsewhere will be
considered. Final versions of the manuscript should be supplied
in both hard copy and disc, preferably on WordPerfect format, IBM


compatible. Use of other wordprocessors requires previous consent


by the editor. Manuscripts should conform to the journal's
specifications, which can be obtained upon request. They should
contain a 400 word abstract. Name, address, institutional
affiliation of the author(s), and e-mail address should be
written in a separate title page. All  manuscripts will be
refereed.

                              Call For Participation

		    Workshop  on  Disjunctive  Logic  Programs


    The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers active in the
area of disjunctive logic programming and related fields, involving reason-
ing with indefinite information. The workshop will be held in conjunction
with the International Logic Programming Symposium (formerly
NACLP) to be held in San Diego, California, U.S.A., from October 28
to October 31, 1991. The workshop will be held after the conference.

    The format of the workshop will be in the form of presentations (of
20-30 minutes duration) on completed work and work in progress.  We
also expect the workshop to be informal, providing a forum for close
interactions between participants. Presentations and discussions are 
invited on any topic relevant to disjunctive programming, including
but not limited to

    o Semantics for Disjunctive Logic Programming

    o Procedural Interpretations of Disjunctive Logic Programming

    o Implementations of Disjunctive Logic Programming Systems

    o Applications of Disjunctive Logic Programming

    o Reasoning with Incomplete Information

    o Disjunctive Databases

    o Non-monotonic Reasoning and Disjunctive Information.

If you are interested in giving a presentation of your current research
at the workshop, please send an extended abstract (about 6 pages) by
August 15, 1991, to the address given below. Notification of acceptance
will be given by September 15, 1991. We intend to bring out a proceed-
ings of the workshop in the form of an informal publication and would
require a revised abstract or a full paper of accepted presentations by
October 1, 1991. Those who are only interested in attending the work-
shop are also welcome and are kindly requested to send their postal and
electronic addresses.

Sender: spp-request@umiacs.UMD.EDU

I don't think the 10-15% brain utilization myth had a unitary
origin. It is a systematic misinterpretation of some of the
early localization data from lesions and stimulation. Insensitive
tests yielded many "silent" areas in non-sensory and non-motor
regions of the cortex (e.g., large regions of the frontal lobe),
because neither removal nor stimulation seemed to have any
detectable effects. Probably Lashley's data on "equipotentiality"
were part of the basis for this simplistic interpretation. So
if we haven't got tests that show what it's used for, it must
be unused -- which is the way the pop press spinoffs had it.

By now, of course, neuroscientists, and especially clinical 
neuropsychologists have found tests and functional specificity
in just about all the formerly "silent" areas.

          BBS Multiple Book Review of:

		     UNIFIED THEORIES OF COGNITION
		     (Harvard University Press, 1990)

		     Allen Newell
		     School of Computer Science
		     Carnegie-Mellon University

This book presents the case that cognitive science should turn its
attention to developing theories of human cognition that cover the full
range of human perceptual, cognitive, and action phenomena. Cognitive
science has now produced a massive number of high quality regularities
with many microtheories that reveal important mechanisms. The need for
integration is pressing and will continue to increase. Equally
important, cognitive science now has the theoretical concepts and tools
to support serious attempts at unified theories. The argument is made
entirely by presenting an exemplar unified theory of cognition both to
show what a real unified theory would be like and to provide convincing
evidence that such theories are feasible. The exemplar is Soar, a
cognitive architecture realized as a software system. After a
detailed discussion of the architecture and its properties, with its
relation to the constraints on cognition in the real world and to
existing ideas in cognitive science, Soar is used as a theory for a
wide range of cognitive phenomena: immediate responses
(stimulus-response compatibility and the Sternberg phenomena); discrete
motor skills (transcription typing); memory and learning (episodic
memory and the acquisition of skill through practice); problem solving
(cryptarithmetic puzzles and syllogistic reasoning); language (sentence
verification and taking instructions); and development (transitions in
the balance beam task). The treatments vary in depth and adequacy, but
they clearly reveal a single, highly specific, operational theory that
works over the entire range of human cognition. Soar is presented as an
exemplar unified theory, not as the sole candidate. Cognitive science
is not ready yet for a single theory -- there must be multiple
attempts. But cognitive science must begin to work towards such unified
theories.

             Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science - RuCCS

            Inaugural Conference on Cognitive Architecture
                     Agenda: Oct 31 - Nov 2

As part of the inauguration of the new Rutgers Centre for
Cognitive Science (RuCCS) we are holding a conference/workshop on
Nov 1 and 2 (with a reception at 7:00 pm on Oct 31 at the Center)
at Rutgers University's Busch Campus, New Brunswick.  The
conference is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, The
Office of Naval Research, and the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research and is intended to provide an opportunity for scholars
in many different disciplines to discuss aspects of COGNITIVE
ARCHITECTURE.  Researchers from several fields and from several
countries will take part in both paper presentations and
discussion panels.  The invited papers are intended to cover a
representative spectrum of approaches and the panels will provide
an opportunity for people to interact in an informal workshop
atmosphere.  Although attendance at this conference is open to
qualified researchers and graduate students, we ask that anyone
wishing to attend the Friday (Nov 1) session, other than those on
the program, let us know in advance because of tight space

ABSTRACT:  What evolutionary advantages have shaped the human capacity
for mood? Answers are suggested if moods are seen as specialized states
that increase our ability to cope with certain situations. This target
article considers the hypothesis that high mood helps individuals take
full advantage of the opportunities in propitious situations, whereas
low mood motivates them to seek help, be socially submissive, conserve
resources, and consider alternative strategies in situations where
investments are not paying off.

RATIONALE FOR SOLICITING PEER COMMENTARY: The "skywriting" format
requires paring away all but the skeleton of the argument and
unfortunately allows few citations. Nonetheless, the format is
excellent for my goal of encouraging psychiatrists, psychologists, and
evolutionists to recognize that the question, "What is mood for?" is
legitimate, important, and answerable. I would especially appreciate
comments about (1) the basic approach of seeking evolutionary
explanations for emotions in the adaptive challenges of the situations
that shaped them, (2) alternative hypotheses about the functions of
mood, and (3) the plausibility of the "propitiousness hypothesis" and
(4) additional ways in which it can be tested.

KEYWORDS: Mood, evolution, natural selection, fitness, emotion, adaptation, 
function, depression, psychology, psychiatry. 
 
What function, if any, is served by the capacity for high and low
moods? The development of new psychotropic drugs makes this question
more important, and recent advances in evolutionary approaches to
behavior make it more tractable. I shall (1) briefly justify the
attempt to understand the evolutionary functions of mood, (2) review
major proposals about the functions of mood, and (3) attempt to show
how these proposals fit within a broader hypothesis.

The trait to be explained is high and low mood, that is, ordinary
happiness and sadness. These are addressed as a single trait because
their characteristics appear to be opposite sides of the same coin, and
because their brain regulation mechanisms are closely related, as
demonstrated in manic-depressive illness. Mania, depression, and grief
are not primary objects of explanation here because it is difficult to
tell whether they are sub-specialized adaptations, exaggerations of
normal responses, or pathological states unrelated to normal mood.

It is now recognized that biological traits require evolutionary
explanations of their origins and functions as well as proximate
explanations of their mechanisms and ontogeny (Mayr, 1983). Debates
continue, however, about how to decide whether or not a trait is an
adaptation, how to specify the functions of a trait, what kinds of
evidence are admissible, how evidence should be marshalled, and the
degree of optimality shaped by natural selection (Sober, 1984). These
debates are useful, but so far there is no sign of early consensus. In
the meantime, it is essential that we continue, as best we can, to
propose and test hypotheses about specific traits.

there are several good reasons to think that the capacity for mood was
shaped by natural selection and that it therefore requires an
evolutionary explanation. First, mood is a complex, universal trait and
thus unlikely to be a product of drift, simple mutation, or any process
other than natural selection. Second, the brain mechanisms that
regulate mood could have been shaped only for a trait that was itself
an adaptation. Third, mood responds in predictable ways to specific
situations. Finally, mood consists of stable constellations of
behavioral, physiological and cognitive states that have obvious major
impact on fitness. These arguments do not prove that mood has an
evolutionary explanation, but they justify the search, especially since
the best evidence that a trait is indeed an adaptation is the discovery
of its function.

Two main functions have been proposed for mood: communication and
motivation. Mood has been thought (1) to communicate either a need for
assistance or an individual's rank in a group, and (2) to motivate and
regulate the timing and locus of effort.

Of the two communicative functions of mood, eliciting aid is the more
straightforward. The infant's cry alerts the care-giver that something
is amiss. Later, the toddler's crying signal's separation and motivates
the parent and child to stay together, as described by Bowlby and
Harlow (Bowlby,1969). In adulthood, expressions of sadness solicit aid
from relatives and friends. Many authors have noted that low mood can
also be used deceptively to manipulate others. The solicitation of aid
cannot, however, explain all aspects of mood. In particular, it cannot
readily explain the benefits of happiness, or the physiological and
cognitive changes of high and low mood. Furthermore, if the only
function of mood is communication, it is difficult to explain the
intensity of moods that are experienced alone in the middle of the
night.

Mood also communicates social rank. High mood communicates dominance, low 
mood, submissiveness, and these signals prevent useless fights that would 
only harm both combatants. John Price has long advocated this function for 
mood (Price, 1967), and support has come from others (Gardner, 1982). In 
vervet monkeys, lowered status decreases activity in serotonergic brain 
mechanisms and the administration of serotonergic antidepressants can
increase dominance rank (Raleigh, McGuire, Brammer, Pollack, & Yuwiler,
1991). Low mood motivates behavior to placate dominants, while high
mood motivates high-status individuals to act in ways that maintain and
increase their position in the hierarchy. Although mood undoubtedly
serves these functions, several simple observations suggest that this
cannot be its only role: some events that profoundly influence mood do
not involve social position, some low-status people are happy, and many
high-status people are unhappy.

Mood also has motivational and regulatory functions. One function is to
adjust the timing of effort. When investments are not paying off, it is
wise to stop investing in order to conserve efforts for a later time.
The "conservation-withdrawal response" fits in this category (Engel &
Schmale, 1972), as do analogies between low mood and hibernation. Less
well appreciated are the benefits that high mood offers by increasing
investments at times of high payoff.

The other motivational function of mood is to regulate the locus of
investment. If a strategy is not paying off, or if a goal seems
unattainable, it is wise not only to conserve resources for a more
propitious time, but also to reconsider the viability of the strategy.
Emmy Gut takes this argument the farthest with her suggestion that
depression is an adaptation that motivates social withdrawal in order
to facilitate a reconsideration of how or whether to pursue receding
goals (Gut, 1989). This would explain Bibring's observation that
depression arises from the inability to give up unattainable goals
(Bibring, 1953). Behaviorists propose a similar function in describing
reactions to decreased reinforcement. The maladaptive aspects of
Seligman's helplessness-hopelessness response have been emphasized
(Seligman, 1975), but its foundations may lie in the benefits of not
wasting time and energy on futile efforts.

These four functions of mood are all correct, in part, but none is
sufficient. An explicitly evolutionary approach suggests a broad
hypothesis that integrates the functions of mood. Like other emotions,
high and low mood are behavioral subroutines, specialized states that
have been shaped to increase fitness in certain situations. An
evolutionary explanation of an emotion does not just consist of
describing its functions. Instead, the explanation must first specify
the situations in which the emotion offers advantages, and then show
how the emotion's characteristics increase fitness in the face of the
specific adaptive challenges that arise in those situations (Nesse,
1990, 1991). The characteristics of fear, for example, are useful in
situations that are dangerous. Mood is more complicated.  Because it is
a continuum from high to low, we must look, not for a single situation,
but for some varying aspect of the environment whose different levels
require different behavioral strategies. This approach follows the
behavioral ecological model of searching for the environmental cues and
cognitive mechanisms that regulate various aspects of behavior (Krebs &
Davies, 1984). A primary goal is discover what environmental variable
is tracked by mood.

The environmental variable that seems most likely to regulate mood is
the perceived propitiousness of current circumstances. In propitious
situations, small investments have a high likelihood of a large payoff.
In unpropitious situations, any amount of effort is likely to be
wasted. The propitiousness of a situation influences mood, which in
turn adjusts cognition, physiology, and behavior in coordinated ways
that increase the ability to cope effectively with the situation at
hand. Propitious situations induce high mood, which communicates high
or increasing status, motivates increased energy and risk-taking in
order to get full advantage from short-lived opportunities, and
motivates increased investment in whatever strategies are working well.
If the opportunity is social, the confidence of high mood motivates new
relationships and status challenges that are risky but that might now
pay off. Unpropitious situations induce low mood, which communicates
the need for aid and submissive social withdrawal, and motivates
conserving resources and considering other possible strategies or
goals. When a previously rewarding strategy suddenly stops paying off,
frustration induces a short burst of aggressive energy to see whether
additional effort is likely to overcome the obstacle. If not,
hopelessness may be adaptive when it leads to considering other
opportunities.

In sum, mood seems to motivate the allocation of resources away from
efforts where they will be wasted, and towards those times, strategies,
and enterprises where investments will have a large payoff. In this
sense, mood is an algorithm that shapes major life strategies by
determining how resources are allocated. Making such decisions well is
as crucial to human Darwinian fitness as it is for other animals. Most
animals must decide which prey to pursue and how long to stay in each
patch. For humans (and for other social species), resource allocation
decisions are inordinately complex, because they involve multiple
goals, many individuals and groups, and networks of potentially
incompatible strategies. Resources, for humans, are mostly social
resources. Our investments are mostly in friends, allies and groups,
and the rewards we seek are likewise mostly social. This explains why
social cues so profoundly affect mood, why social withdrawal so
regularly characterizes low mood, and why gregariousness characterizes
high mood.

In addition to providing a framework that integrates previously
proposed functions of mood, this hypothesis makes several predictions.
First, the effects of different environmental situations on mood should
be proportional to their effects on anticipated propitiousness. This
contrasts with the simpler view that moods are affected by gains and
losses and suggests the non-obvious prediction that the effects on mood
should be small when gains are not accompanied by new opportunities and
when losses involve no loss of future rewards per unit of investment.
Second, the characteristics of high and low mood should offer
advantages in situations of high and low propitiousness, respectively.
Several such functions have been mentioned, but much remains to be done
to understand how the characteristics of mood offer benefits. Third,
people who lack the capacity for mood should be at a disadvantage
compared to normal people. Those who lack the capacity for happiness
should be unable to take advantage of opportunities, while those who
lack the capacity for sadness should persist, blithely, in efforts that
offer few payoffs.

This is a bare summary of a longer paper which is in preparation. I do
not claim that the proposed hypothesis for the functions of mood is
correct, but only that it is plausible, and that it demonstrates how a
modern evolutionary approach may increase our understanding of mood. I
welcome comments, especially those about other hypothesized functions
of mood that I have not discussed, and ways in which the propitiousness
hypothesis can be clarified and tested.

                               NEW SUMMER SEMINAR

                     Directors: JERRY FODOR & ERNIE LEPORE
                Location: Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ
                 Dates: June 29 - August 14, 1992 (seven weeks)

     Holism about meaning and intention content has shaped much of what is most
characteristic of contemporary philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.
The seminar is devoted to the question whether the individuation of the
contents of thoughts and linguistic expressions is inherently holistic. For
example, we will discuss arguments that are alleged to show that the meaning of
a scientific hypothesis depends on the entire theory that entails it, or that
the content of a concept depends on the entire belief system of which it is a
part. Implications of holistic semantics for other philosophical issues
(intentional explanation, translation Realism, skepticism, connectionism, etc.)
will also be explored. Authors to be read include Quine, Davidson, Lewis,
Block, Field, Dummett, Dennett, Churchland and others. In addition, we will use
Holism: a Shopper's Guide, Fodor, J. and E. LePore, 1992, Basil Blackwell.

     The National Endowment for the Humanities will provide a summer stipend of
$3,600 for travel, book and living expenses, to those selected as participants
in this seminar. Applications must be postmarked not later than 2 March, 1992.

(1)      HOW WE KNOW OUR MINDS: THE ILLUSION OF FIRST-PERSON

ABSTRACT: As adults we believe that our knowledge of our own
psychological states is substantially different from our knowledge of
the psychological states of others, first-person knowledge coming
directly from experience, but third-person knowledge involving
inference. Developmental evidence suggests otherwise. Many
three-year-old children are consistently wrong in reporting some of
their own immediately past psychological states. They have similar
difficulties reporting the psychological states of others. At about age
4 an important developmental shift to a representational model of the
mind affects children's understanding of their own minds as well as
those of the minds of others. Our sense that our perception of our own
minds is direct may be analogous to many cases where expertise provides
an illusion of direct perception. These empirical findings have
important implications for cognitive science.


(2)      THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FOLK PSYCHOLOGY

KEYWORDS: folk psychology, functionalism, introspection, mental
concepts, propositional attitudes, self-attribution of mental
states, sensations, theory of mind

ABSTRACT: Folk psychology, the naive understanding of mental state
concepts, requires a model of how people ascribe mental states to
themselves. Competent speakers associate a distinctive memory
representation (a category representation, CR) with each mentalistic
word in their lexicon. A decision to ascribe such a word to oneself
depends on matching to the CR an instance representation (IR) of one's
current state. As in visual object recognition, evidence about a CR's
content includes the IRs that are or are not available to trigger a
match. This framework reveals serious problems for functionalism, the
theory-of-mind approach to the meaning of mental terms. A simple
functionalist model is inadequate because it (1) requires relational
and subjunctive information (concerning what would have happened) that
is not generally available; it (2) could lead to combinatorial
explosion. A modified functionalist model can appeal to qualitative
(phenomenological) properties, but the earlier problems still reappear.
Qualitative properties provide a simpler model that need not refer to
functional (causal-relational) properties at all. Qualitative
properties are important for sensations, propositional attitudes, and
their contents. The introspectionist character of the proposed model
does not imply that ascribing mental states to oneself is infallible or
complete; nor is the model refuted by empirical research on
introspective reports. Empirical research on 'theory of mind' does not
support any strict version of functionalism, but only an understanding
of mentalistic words that may rest on phenomenological or experiential
qualities.

ABSTRACT: Psychology can be based on plans, internally held images of
achievement that organize the stimulus-response links of traditional
psychology. The hierarchical structure of plans must be produced, held,
assigned priorities, and monitored. Consciousness is the operation of
the plan-executing mechanism, enabling behavior to be driven by plans
rather than immediate environmental contingencies. The mechanism
unpacks a single internally held idea into a series of actions. New in
this paper is the proposal that language uses this mechanism for
communication, unpacking an idea into a series of articulatory acts.
Language comprehension uses the plan-monitoring mechanism to pack a
series of linguistic events into an idea. Recursive processing results
from monitoring one's own speech. Neurophysiologically, the planning
mechanism is identified with higher-order motor control.

KEYWORDS: consciousness, language, plans, motivation, evolution, motor system

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1. Consciousness is one of the central problems that led to the
founding of modern psychology in the 19th century. The method for
studying it was originally introspection, a technique that failed to
deliver what was needed because the data of introspection were internal
experiences rather than objectifiable events. Since data could not be
verified, the method was defective and was abandoned.

1.2. By rejecting consciousness as a legitimate object of study,
psychology made great advances in the study of perceptual, motor and
control processes but lost sight of the issue of the role of
consciousness in mental life. Recently, the issue has re-emerged with
more objective methods, such as probes of memory by priming and
reaction time, and with the recognition that many mental functions are
unconscious. A new psychology of plans promises to include
consciousness by organizing and synthesizing the many subdisciplines
that have grown within psychology and the cognitive neurosciences.

2.0 PLANS AS THE CENTER OF PSYCHOLOGY

2.1. Bringing consciousness back into the mainstream of cognitive
psychology requires a reorienting of psychology itself. Throughout this
century the dominant metatheory in psychology has been the
stimulus-response link, the connection between environment and
behavior. The job of psychology was to explain what happened between a
stimulus and a response, and not much else. In behaviorism this
orientation was obvious. Modern cognitive psychology retains a similar
orientation, however -- the innovation is that additional boxes,
representing internal processes, are interposed between stimulus and
response. But the diagrams always have a stimulus at one end and a
response at the other. The approach of the "new connectionism" is the
same at a more microscopic level of neural modeling, with hidden units
allowed.

2.2. This kind of psychology has been extremely productive in
describing and explaining the information flows that occur in many
tasks and it is a necessary part of a plan-oriented psychology. But it
is incomplete in that the motivation for activating a particular
block-diagram mode of information flow is not specified. That is, we
may understand how visual information from an object is filtered,
processed, and compared with remembered information about objects, but
the theory does not address why the subject was looking at the object
in the first place.
The act of looking was motivated by a plan, an internally held image of
an intended achievement (Miller, Galanter & Pribram, 1960). The image
is an internal representation, not necessarily a graphic visualizable
entity. The plan is defined more broadly here than in its everyday
sense, to mean a scheme that can control a sequence of actions to
achieve a goal.

2.3. It is plans that motivate behavior. Thus the block diagram of
cognitive psychology usually describes a method for executing a
low-level plan, for example, a plan to examine an object. If most of
the minitheories of modern cognitive psychology concern fragments of
plans and they are generally organized by plans, then the plans become
the prime movers, the keys to understanding how behavior is controlled
(Shallice, 1978).
Current models of pattern recognition, recall, attention, etc.
become the means to an end.

2.4. If the centrality of plans in human mental life is a reality, then it
is important to understand more about how and why plans are established
and executed and why the control of behavior by plans rather than
direct control by the environment should have evolved.

2.5. The power of plans is that they allow an organism to escape from
the contingencies of its immediate surroundings, to be controlled
instead by its own needs in the longer term. A simple animal responds
to its environment and to its internal states in a machine-like way and
has no need for plans. The fly does not make a decision to feed: When
food is at hand in the environment and internal receptors are in the
right states, feeding simply happens. More complex organisms can store
several plans simultaneously, executing one while holding others in
abeyance. Humans typically have hundreds of plans, from small,
immediate ones such as eating the next bite of dinner to large ones
such as earning a college degree. Large-scale plans in turn contain a
hierarchy of smaller-scale plans.

2.6. As a plan is executed, a single goal state or idea is unpacked
into a series of actions. The plan must be held in an active, working
memory while this occurs. Plans can also be discussed in terms of the
psychology of motivation; modern conceptions of motivation include the
pathway from motivating influences such as instinctive needs or
selective attention, through plans, to action (Heckhausen, 1991). The
plan becomes the path from motivation to action.

2.7. Organization of behavior by plans requires neurological machinery
to support the planning function and its various ancillary needs. There
must be neurological devices to (1) make plans, (2) store them, (3)
execute them, and (4) monitor them (Bridgeman, 1986; 1988). In order to
control behavior, the currently active plan must have access to memory
and attention. It must link these functions with perception in order to
guide action according to a combination of the internally held plan and
the external realities of the perceptual world.

2.8. Here is where a natural explanation for the phenomenon of
consciousness emerges: In this scheme it appears in the plan currently
being executed. Consciousness of events, actions and ideas is nothing
more or less than a result of the operation of this mechanism, along
with its requisite memory functions. In the process it has access to
episodic memory, bringing episodes from the past into working memory,
and it lays down new episodic memories. The reportability of
experiences, thoughts and actions, then, is based on an intimate
interaction between behavioral control and memory. Though consciousness
in this conception emerges from the planning process, not everything
that is experienced consciously is related to plans. Perceptions, to
the degree that they enter the episodic memory, also have the ability
to affect behavior and to engage the mechanisms that generate
consciousness.

2.9. Thus consciousness becomes not a separate neural module, but a
result of the operation of the planning process. It is an active
process, not a passive state (Freeman, 1990): the result of the
planning process taking control of behavior and gaining access to
memory and sensory input. In this context it is meaningless to look for
a box labelled "consciousness" in a brain model, or to try to localize
it in the brain's anatomy. The operations that make us conscious occur
in the context of controlling behavior from a plan, and consciousness
has no separate existence of its own. Because it is an effect, not a
cause, there is no sense in looking for its functions.

2.10. Planning seems necessary to evoke consciousness, but it is not
sufficient. Some very routine plans, even quite complex ones such as
driving home along an accustomed route, seem to take place without
awareness, or at least without a subsequent episodic memory of the
events. The episodic memory seems so confounded with earlier
experiences of the same activity that it fails to be recorded as a
separate experience. The activity fails to pass the memory test of
awareness: we ask whether someone was aware of an event or action by
asking whether they can describe it from memory. In defining tasks that
require "deliberate attentional resources", Norman and Shallice (1980)
indicated that they (a) involve planning or decision-making, (b)
involve components of trouble shooting, (c) are ill-learned or contain
novel sequences of actions, (d) are judged to be dangerous or
technically difficult, or (e) require overcoming a strong habitual
response or resisting temptation. Executing a very routine plan that
does not meet these criteria seems to leave the planning mechanism free
to engage in other activities, frequently activities involving
language.

3.0 RELATIONSHIP OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE

3.1. The plan-executing module has the job of taking a parallel,
simultaneous idea and converting it into a sequence of serial behaviors
or subplans. The mechanism is identifiable in all primates, perhaps in
all mammals. The classic studies of Koehler (1925) showed that
chimpanzees could plan a behavioral sequence with several steps, such
as piling boxes to stand on and reach a banana suspended high
overhead. Even dogs can solve detour problems that require them to move
away from a reward in order to reach it eventually.

3.2. In the course of human evolution this plan-executing module became
more complex and loomed ever more important in mental life. At one
point, I suggest, it began to be pressed into service for organizing
communication as well as action. A single idea is unpacked into a
series of words, and those in turn into phonemes, in the same way that
any other plan (idea) is elaborated. In both the execution of actions
on the world and the execution of communications, an ordered sequence
of internally organized acts replaces the environmentally released
behaviors of lower animals.

3.3. Analogously, speech understanding is handled by another existing
module. It normally monitors the progress of plans, taking a sequence
of events and packing it into an idea. Again, an immediate working
memory is centrally involved in this process. Language could evolve
quickly, on an evolutionary time scale, because it was made mostly out
of old parts. The sequencing and comprehension mechanisms were already
developed for the planning and monitoring of actions, respectively.
Only the articulatory apparatus and perhaps a specialized grammatical
ordering system (Bickerton, 1983; 1984) had to be added.

3.4. At this point a question arises whether planning and language
share the same mechanism, or whether a new parallel planning mechanism
evolved to specialize in language. There are many examples of the
evolution of new functions by the doubling of genes, resulting in two
copies of a morphological feature. Many cereal grains, for example,
developed in this way. One of the copies is then free to evolve into
something else. The open and flexible property of the planning
mechanism, however, allows for language to be added to its functions
with little or no change. The mechanism already had the capacity to
handle many plans simultaneously, to organize each one, to put them
into priority, and to handle plans for different kinds of actions.

3.5. Once the relationship between language and planning is
articulated, a We are acutely aware of what we say and what is being
said to us. This contrasts with nonlinguistic communications, such as
human cries and laughs, which we produce without planning, as
incidental concomitants of other activities or emotional states. We are
capable of imitating these vocal outbursts, but we cannot deliberately
produce them except in the proper context as part of other activities.
Once the utterance occurs, whether linguistic or not, it is perceived
like any other event. The essential difference is in the planning, not
the perception. Perception of our nonlinguistic utterances puts us in
touch with our emotions, while perception of our own language puts us
in contact with our ideas.

3.6. This view is not without precedent. Indeed, even the word for
consciousness in English, Russian and the romance languages translates
as co-knowledge, those aspects of mental life that are communicated or
are potentially communicable. Russian psychology has capitalized on
this etymology, emphasizing the enhancement of conscious function that
comes from social cooperation and communication (Luria, 1981). Many
psychologists from Wundt onward have pointed out the privileged
position of language in human awareness.

3.7. The appearance of language as a communicative act generated by the
planning mechanism brought with it some immediate and very powerful
advantages. Not the least of these is that one also hears one's own
speech, so that the plan-monitoring mechanism has immediate access to
the plan-executing mechanism's products. In the process of development
the loop can become internal, as pointed out by Vygotskii (1962) in his
analysis of the importance of internal speech in human thinking. The
whole planning process is made recursive, and the enormous power of
human thought becomes available with a relatively minor change in a
mechanism that all primates share. Again, this process allows quick
evolution of a seemingly complex addition to the human brain.

3.8. Needless to say, these advantages created a strong selective
pressure in early humans or pre-humans to improve the language faculty.
The categorical nature of the components of speech (phonemes and words)
made it possible to transfer an idea from one human's brain to
another's, under reasonably favorable conditions, without error. The
task was accomplished with the communicative advantages of hierarchical
digital coding, combining a small set of qualitatively different
phonemes to make up distinct words. This does not apply to other animal
communication systems.

3.9. Up to this point the operation of the plan-executing function has
addressed only narrative consciousness, awareness of one's perceptions
and actions. In the current analysis, this sort of consciousness would
have to be admitted in animals as well, to the degree that they can
separate behavior from environment with a planning mechanism. But
language changes everything. If the currently executed plan is a
linguistic one, a plan to perform a communicative act rather than a
conventional action sequence, one can become aware of one's own ideas;
an enhanced self-consciousness becomes possible.

3.10. An action plan becomes conscious only in the process of its
execution. What is unique about the linguistic action plan is that
whereas the processes that generate speech remain unconscious, the
linguistic sequence can be fed back into the neurological system that
normally monitors external events connected with executing a plan.
Essential to this capability is the parallel-serial-parallel route from
a simultaneously held idea, through sequential plan-executing
mechanisms, and back into a perceptual module that accepts sequences,
all without overt behavior. If internally planned speech is fed back to
a language-understanding process without leaving the brain, ideas from
one's own internal language (thoughts) can be stored in the episodic
memory that normally holds the perceptual results of the
plan-monitoring process. The relationship between planning and
consciousness, however, remains the same for linguistic acts as for
other planned sequences that act on the environment in an instrumental
way. Pribram (1990) traces the resulting reflective self-awareness or
intentionality back through von Uexkull to Brentano. There are still
other kinds of consciousness that I do not have the space to address
(Baars, 1988).

4.0 THE NEUROLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

4.1. In the above sketch, consciousness is associated with planning for
action, and as such it results from the operation of the controller of
motor activity. To see how the controller might be organized, a
comparison of the neural organization of sensory and motor systems is
useful.

4.2. The organization of sensory systems can be summarized with the
example of vision, the best-examined of the sensory modalities.
Cortical representation of vision begins at the striate cortex, area
17, located at the posterior pole of the neocortex. Striate cortex is
concerned primarily with visual processing in a retinotopic mode,
including such functions as binocular interaction and spatial frequency
analysis, although the receptive fields of striate neurons are also
influenced by the task an animal is performing (Artim & Bridgeman,
1989; Bridgeman, 1982). The organization is strictly topographic, with
a dazzling degree of organization into stripes and blobs, columns and
hypercolumns. As one moves anteriorly in the cortex, the visual field
is represented again and again, in ever more abstract codes that
progressively change from representing the form of the stimulus to
presenting its meaning to the animal. Precision of localization is
exchanged for sophistication of coding, and different functions are
handled in different maps of the visual field. Finally, in
inferotemporal and parietal areas, neurons are affected more by
particular applications of the information than by the visual image
itself.

4.3. The organization of the motor system is similar to that of vision,
beginning with the primary motor cortex at the posterior edge of the
frontal lobe. This cortex codes motor acts organized in a topographic
representation of the body's muscle groups but it does not code literal
muscle movements; rather, one finds an image of intended achievement
(Pribram, 1971); in other words, it holds the synthesis of a plan,
probably one that is originated elsewhere. Analogously to visual
organization, the motor field is represented many times on the cortex,
and analogously to the more anterior cortex, it represents more
abstract aspects of the motor organization process. Since plans are
concerned with long-term organization of motor activity, the most
anterior prefrontal regions are concerned with the processes of
synthesizing plans. A few of the nonprimary motor areas in humans have
evolved to specialize for language: Greenfield (1991) provides an
example of how Broca's area, originally a more generalized control
field in primates, split in the course of evolution to include a
linguistic articulatory function for symbolic communication in the left
hemisphere.

4.4. Information from the sensory systems and from limbic areas
concerned with motivation and emotion is used in creating and executing
the plans, tying anterior and posterior functions together. Orbital
prefrontal cortex is a point of contact of planning with the
motivational and emotional concerns.

4.6. Almost all of the processing is unconscious; what we perceive
consciously is only the tip of a neuronal iceberg (Bridgeman, 1992).
Everywhere the neurophysiologist looks, unconscious processing
dominates brain function. The receptive fields, anatomical arrangements
and biochemical processes of neurophysiology remain hidden from
conscious experience, not by repression but by structural limitations
on the planning mechanism itself. We become aware only of the plan
currently being executed and of the perceptual and motor events
surrounding it.

4.7. As this preliminary analysis shows, the reorganization of
psychology around plans will also require a reinterpretation of
neurological function. The organization of plans becomes the central
business of much of the brain, other regions being concerned with their
execution and with providing the sensory information needed to make
them successful.

ABSTRACT: How do people make deductions? The orthodox view is that they
use mental inference rules like those of a formal logic. This monograph
argues that their logical competence depends, not on formal rules, but
on mental models. People construct models of the situation described by
the premises, using their linguistic knowledge and their general
knowledge. They try to formulate a conclusion based on these models
that maintains semantic information, that expresses it parsimoniously,
and that makes explicit something not directly stated by a premise.
They test the validity of the conclusion by searching for alternative
models that might refute it. The theory also resolves longstanding
puzzles about reasoning, including the problem of how nonmonotonic
reasoning occurs in daily life. The book reports experiments on all the
main domains of deduction, including inferences based on propositional
connectives such as "if" and "or," inferences based on relations such
as "in the same place as," inferences based on quantifiers such as
"none" "any" and "only," and metalogical inferences based on
assertions about the true and the false. Where the two theories make
opposite predictions, the results confirm the mental-model theory and
run counter to the formal rule theory. Without exception, all the
experiments corroborate the two main predictions of the model theory:
inferences requiring only one model are easier to make than those
requiring multiple models, and erroneous conclusions are usually the
result of constructing only one of the possible models of the
premises.

   "What" and "Where" in Spatial Language and Spatial Cognition

Fundamental to spatial knowledge in all species are the representations
underlying object recognition, object search, and navigation through
space. What sets humans apart from other species is our ability to
express spatial experience through language. In this target article, we
explore the language of objects and places, asking what geometric
properties are preserved in the representations underlying object nouns
and spatial prepositions in English. Evidence from these two aspects of
language suggests there are significant differences in the geometric richness
with which objects and places are encoded. When objects are named as
objects (i.e. with count nouns), detailed geometric properties of the
object -- principally its shape (axes, solid and hollow volumes,
surfaces, and parts) -- are represented. In contrast, when objects play
the role of either "figure" (located object) or "ground" (reference
object) in a locational expression, only very coarse geometric object
properties are represented, primarily the object's main axes. In
addition, the spatial functions encoded by spatial prepositions tend to
be nonmetric and relatively coarse, for example, "containment,"
"contact," "relative distance," and "relative direction." These
properties are representative of other languages as well. The striking
differences in the way that language encodes objects vs. places lead us
to suggest two explanations: First, a tendency for languages to level
out geometric detail from both object and place representations;
second, a nonlinguistic disparity between the representations of
"what" and "where" that underlies the representation of objects and
places in language. As a whole, the language of objects and places is
shown to converge with and enrich our understanding of the
corresponding spatial representations.

0.0  ABSTRACT: This target article reviews evidence for the functional
equivalence of spatial representations of observed environments and
environments described in discourse. It is argued that people possess a
spatial representation system that constructs mental spatial models on
the basis of perceptual and linguistic information. Evidence for a
distinct spatial system is reviewed.

        FROM SIMPLE ASSOCIATIONS TO SYSTEMATIC REASONING:

term memory; long-term memory; working memory; systematicity.

ABSTRACT: Human agents draw a variety of inferences effortlessly,
spontaneously, and with remarkable efficiency --- as though these
inferences were a reflex response of their cognitive apparatus.
Furthermore, these inferences are drawn with reference to a large body
of background knowledge. This remarkable human ability is hard to
explain given findings on the complexity of reasoning reported by
researchers in artificial intelligence. It also poses a challenge for
cognitive science and computational neuroscience: How can a system of
simple and slow neuron-like elements represent a large body of
systematic knowledge and perform a range of inferences with such speed?
We describe a computational model that takes a step toward addressing
the cognitive science challenge and resolving the artificial
intelligence puzzle. We show how a connectionist network can encode
millions of facts and rules involving n-ary predicates and variables
and can perform a class of inferences in a few hundred milliseconds.
Efficient reasoning requires the rapid representation and propagation
of dynamic bindings. Our model achieves this by representing (1)
dynamic bindings as the synchronous firing of appropriate nodes, (2)
rules as interconnection patterns that direct the propagation of
rhythmic activity, and (3) long-term facts as temporal pattern-matching
sub-networks. The model is consistent with recent neurophysiological
findings which suggest that synchronous activity occurs in the brain
and may play a representational role in neural information processing.
The model also makes specific, psychologically significant predictions
about the nature of reflexive reasoning. It identifies constraints on
the form of rules that may participate in such reasoning and relates
the capacity of the working memory underlying reflexive reasoning to
biological parameters such as the frequency at which nodes can sustain
oscillations and the coarseness of synchronization.

----------
   JANET users who do not have the facilty for interactive file
   transfer mentioned above have two options for getting BBS files. The
   first, which is simpler but may be subject to traffic delays, uses
   the file transfer utility at JANET node UK.AC.FT-RELAY. Use standard
   file transfer, setting the site to be UK.AC.FT-RELAY, the userid as
   anonymous@edu.princeton, for the password your-own-userid@your-site
   [the "@" is crucial], and for the remote filename the filename
   according to Unix conventions (i.e. something like
   pub/harnad/bbs.authorname). Lower case should be used where
   indicated, with quotes if necessary to avoid automatic translation
   into upper case. Setting the remote filename to be (D)pub/harnad
   instead of the one indicated above will provide you with a directory
   listing.

   The alternative, faster but more complicated procedure is to log on
   to JANET site UK.AC.NSF.SUN (with userid and password both given as
   guestftp), and then transfer the file interactively to a directory
   on that site (named by you when you log on). The method for transfer
   is as described above under 'Certain non-Unix/Internet sites', or
   you can make use of the on-line help that is available. Transfer of
   the file received to your own site is best done from your own site;
   the remote file (on the UK.AC.NSF.SUN machine) should be named as
   directory-name/filename (the directory name to use being that
   provided by you when you logged on to UK.AC.NSF.SUN). To be sociable
   (since NSF.SUN is short of disc space), once you have received the
   file on your own machine you should go back to UK.AC.NSF.SUN and
   delete it from your directory there.

   [Thanks to Brian Josephson for the above detailed UK/JANET
   instructions; similar special instructions for file retrieval
   from other networks or countries would be appreciated and will
   be included in updates of these instructions.]

Where the above procedures are not available (e.g. from Bitnet or other
networks), there are two fileservers --  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet -- that will do the transfer for you. Send either one the
one line message:

ABSTRACT: In most social species, position in the male social hierarchy
and reproductive success are positively correlated. This relationship
is less clear in humans where studies of traditional societies have
produced mixed results.  In the most economically advanced human
populations, the adaptiveness of status attainment vanishes altogether
as social status and fertility are uncorrelated. These findings have
been interpreted by many as suggesting that evolutionary principles may
not be appropriate for the explanation of human behavior, especially in
modern environments. The present study tests the adaptiveness of social
status with actual mating and reproductive data in a representative
sample of males from an industrial society. Results show that
reproductive success, even when assessed by a more reliable measure of
male fertility than the one commonly used, fails to correlate with
social status. In striking contrast, however, status is found to be
highly correlated with proximate components of fitness, accounting for
as much as 62% of the variance in male mating success. This effect is
remarkably similar to the one found in many traditional societies and
would result in a substantial relationship between cultural and
reproductive success in industrial populations were it not for the
novel conditions imposed by contraception and monogamy. Various
underlying mechanisms are suggested for these findings, and the value
of current behavioral and reproductive data is stressed for the study
of adaptation. It is concluded that evolutionary explanations of human
behavior remain entirely relevant in modern societies.

To help you decide whether you would be an appropriate commentator for
this article, an electronic draft is retrievable by anonymous ftp from
princeton.edu according to the instructions below (the filename is
bbs.perusse). Please do not prepare a commentary on this draft. Just
let us know, after having inspected it, what relevant expertise you
feel you would bring to bear on what aspect of the article.
-------------------------------------------------------------
   To retrieve a file by ftp from a Unix/Internet site, type either:
ftp princeton.edu
   or
ftp 128.112.128.1
   When you are asked for your login, type:
anonymous
   Enter password as per instructions (make sure to include the specified @),
   and then change directories with:
cd pub/harnad
   To show the available files, type:
ls
   Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example):
get bbs.perusse
   When you have the file(s) you want, type:
quit

   Certain non-Unix/Internet sites have a facility you can use that is
   equivalent to the above. Sometimes the procedure for connecting to
   princeton.edu will be a two step process such as:
ftp
   followed at the prompt by:
open princeton.edu
  or
open 128.112.128.1

   In case of doubt or difficulty, consult your system manager.
----------
   JANET users who do not have the facilty for interactive file
   transfer mentioned above have two options for getting BBS files. The
   first, which is simpler but may be subject to traffic delays, uses
   the file transfer utility at JANET node UK.AC.FT-RELAY. Use standard
   file transfer, setting the site to be UK.AC.FT-RELAY, the userid as
   anonymous@edu.princeton, for the password your-own-userid@your-site
   [the "@" is crucial], and for the remote filename the filename
   according to Unix conventions (i.e. something like
   pub/harnad/bbs.authorname). Lower case should be used where
   indicated, with quotes if necessary to avoid automatic translation
   into upper case. Setting the remote filename to be (D)pub/harnad
   instead of the one indicated above will provide you with a directory
   listing.

   The alternative, faster but more complicated procedure is to log on
   to JANET site UK.AC.NSF.SUN (with userid and password both given as
   guestftp), and then transfer the file interactively to a directory
   on that site (named by you when you log on). The method for transfer
   is as described above under 'Certain non-Unix/Internet sites', or
   you can make use of the on-line help that is available. Transfer of
   the file received to your own site is best done from your own site;
   the remote file (on the UK.AC.NSF.SUN machine) should be named as
   directory-name/filename (the directory name to use being that
   provided by you when you logged on to UK.AC.NSF.SUN). To be sociable
   (since NSF.SUN is short of disc space), once you have received the
   file on your own machine you should go back to UK.AC.NSF.SUN and
   delete it from your directory there.

   [Thanks to Brian Josephson for the above detailed UK/JANET
   instructions; similar special instructions for file retrieval
   from other networks or countries would be appreciated and will
   be included in updates of these instructions.]
---
Where the above procedures are not available (e.g. from Bitnet or other
networks), there are two fileservers --  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet -- that will do the transfer for you. Send either one the
one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

Call For Multiple Book Reviews: Ford/Hayes: "The Frame Problem"

PSYCOLOQUY is calling for multiple electronic book reviews. Qualified
professionals from the spectrum of disciplines covered by PSYCOLOQUY
(psychology, the cognitive sciences, neuroscience, behavioral and
evolutionary biology, computer science, linguisitics and philosophy)
are invited to submit reviews (~500 lines) on the volume below (or on
other books you would like to see reviewed in PSYCOLOQUY). All
submissions are subject to editorial review.

If book authors wish to submit a summary of their recent books and to
send review copies to the PSYCOLOQUY editorial office, a Call for
Reviewers like this one will be posted, and the copies will be
distributed to selected reviewers. Note that what appears below is just
a brief synopsis of an edited volume, and hence will NOT be archived
but will only appear in PSYC's newsletter section; if a monograph's
authors submit an article-length author's Precis, however (~500 lines),
it will be refereed and may appear in the archival journal portion of
PSYCOLOQUY.

For the article below, please let us know if you wish to review it,
indicating your qualifications (and including a CV). If you already
have the book and wish to submit a review directly without checking
first, that is fine too (but publication is in no case guaranteed).

Send queries and reviews to:
                   psyc@pucc.bitnet or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu

What happens when one picks up a brick? Any child knows that the brick
is now held in the air, there is one fewer object on the ground, and
THAT'S ALL. For over twenty years it has been astonishingly hard to
make a computer draw this last conclusion reliably and convincingly, or
even to say precisely what it means. This "frame problem" is
symptomatic of a host of problems in how to properly represent common
knowledge about everyday actions. The papers in this collection
(originally presented at a 1989 workshop) discuss some of these
problems, develop approaches to solving them, or draw philosophical
conclusions from them.

Some approaches to action reasoning assume that what is needed is more
information for the programs to use. Others focus rather on the
reasoning methods they use. In the former spirit, Haugh develops an
axiomatic theory of causal relationships, and Weld argues that system
dynamics are needed. Tenenberg, however, urges the use of a
probabilistic approach to knowledge representation, and Brown develops
a new quantified modal logic which contains the seeds of its own
description.

Some of the papers develop or criticise themes that are familiar in AI.
Etherington, Kraus and Perlis explain and extend McCarthy's technique
of circumscriptive reasoning. Goodwin and Trudel relate the idea of
"persistence" - that things should stay true unless there is a reason
to falsify them - to that of time as a continuum (a surprisingly
underdeveloped idea in this area). Weber criticises persistence as an
unrealistically strong assumption and shows that it has some
unintuitive consequences.

Erik Sandewall makes a revisionist survey of the classical AI
literature and suggests that what has always been regarded as an
unfortunate pun - the frame problem and Minsky's representational
notation of frames - should in fact be taken seriously.

Some of the chapters discuss broader questions. Perlis relates this
whole complex of representational difficulties to the fact that the
agents we are trying to imitate have evolved with only very partial
knowledge of their worlds. Stein generalises the frame problem, as
usually described, to the point where it seems to be the general
problem of counterfactual reasoning: an alarming and controversial
conclusion. Fetzer, a philosopher of science, and Hayes, one of the
book's editors, give us a debate on the relevance of philosophy to AI.
Fetzer argues that the frame problem is really the problem of
scientific induction, so a successful robot must have solved Hume's
problem. Hayes argues that Fetzer misunderstands the nature of the AI
enterprise and Fetzer replies with a suggestion that a new kind of
programming might be the answer.

Most of the papers are self-contained and some provide excellent
introductions to the frame problem and the history of attempts to solve
it.

 Principles for an Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Theory of Higher Cognition

			      Long Abstract

The main claim of this paper is that connectionism offers cognitive
science a number of excellent opportunities for turning methodological,
theoretical, and meta-theoretical schisms into powerful
integrations---opportunities for forging constructive synergy out of
the destructive interference which plagues the field.  The paper begins
with an analysis of the rifts in the field and what it would take to
overcome them.  We argue that while connectionism has often contributed
to the deepening of these schisms, it is nonetheless possible to turn
this trend around---possible for connectionism to play a central role
in a unification of cognitive science.  Essential to this process is
the development of strong theoretical principles founded (in part) on
connectionist computation; a main goal of this paper is to demonstrate
that such principles are indeed within the reach of a
connectionist-grounded theory of cognition.  The enterprise rests on a
willingness to entertain, analyze, and extend characterizations of
cognitive problems, and hypothesized solutions, which are deliberately
overly simple and general---in order to discover the insights they can
offer through mathematical analyses which this simplicity and
generality are makes possible.

In this paper, seven interrelated principles are articulated, analyzed,
and applied.  The three areas of application concern (1) computational,
(2) linguistic, and (3) philosophical problems in cognitive science:
(1) the integration of connectionist and symbolic computation; (2) the
syntactic, semantic and phonological components of grammar; and (3) the
explanation of the systematicity and productivity of higher cognition.

With respect to (1), principles integrating connectionist and symbolic
computation are developed by establishing mathematical relationships
between two levels of description of a single computational system:  at
the lower level, the system is formally described in terms of highly
distributed patterns of activity over connectionist units, and the
dynamics of these units; at the higher level, the same system is
formally described by symbolic structures and symbol manipulation.
Specific treatment of recursion is developed, and the principles are
shown to be strong enough to allow the specification of arbitrary
formal languages (and hence Turing machine computation).

Applied to natural language, application (2), the computational
principles entail that a central organizing principle of grammar should
be _optimality_:  a grammar is a means of determining which of any
set of structural analyses of an input is the most well-formed.  Such a
grammar consists of a set of ``soft'' rules or constraints, each of
which is in principle violable in the appropriate context.  This
constitutes a novel framework for formal grammar which emerges from the
connectionist computational substrate.  It is shown how such soft rules
allow for precise treatment of the complex interaction of semantic and
syntactic factors in a linguistic problem that has been the subject of
considerable research in recent years, that of split intransitivity.
Work showing that soft constraints embodying optimality principles
allow significant progress in the development of a theory of universal
phonology is briefly summarized.

Finally, the principles are shown to successfully meet the foundational
challenge (3) posed by Fodor & Pylyshyn (1988): to use connectionism to
explain the systematicity and productivity of language and thought,
without merely implementing the traditional symbolic explanation.  On
the new account described here, symbols and rules have a novel status
in cognitive theory: they play essential roles in mathematical proofs
which explain these crucial properties of higher cognition, but they do
not play a role in algorithms which causally generate this behavior.

The paper concludes with an assessment of how well the principles meet
the goals set for them.

   KEYWORDS: culture, cultural learning, imitation, instruction,
   collaboration, social learning, intentionality, joint attention,
   intersubjectivity, theory of mind

   ABSTRACT: This target article presents a theory of human cultural
   learning, a form of social learning in which intersubjectivity or
   perspective-taking plays a vital role, both in the original learning
   process and in the resulting cognitive product. Cultural learning
   manifests itself in three forms during human ontogeny: imitative
   learning, instructed learning, and collaborative learning--in that
   order. Evidence is provided that this progression arises from the
   developmental ordering of the underlying social-cognitive concepts and
   processes involved. Imitative learning relies on a concept of a
   intentional agent and involves simple perspective-taking. Instructed
   learning relies on a concept of a mental agent and involves coordinated
   altering perspective-taking (intersubjectivity). Collaborative learning
   relies on a concept of a reflective agent and involves integrated
   perspective-taking (reflective intersubjectivity). Further evidence for
   these correlations between social cognition and cultural learning is
   provided through a comparison among normal children, autistic children,
   and wild and educated chimpanzees. Cultural learning is a uniquely
   human form of social learning that allows for a fidelity of
   transmission of behaviors and information among conspecifics that
   is not possible in other forms of social learning, thereby providing the
   psychological basis for cultural evolution.

To help you decide whether you would be an appropriate commentator for
this article, an electronic draft is retrievable by anonymous ftp from
princeton.edu according to the instructions below (the filename is
bbs.tomasello). Please do not prepare a commentary on this draft. Just
let us know, after having inspected it, what relevant expertise you
feel you would bring to bear on what aspect of the article.
-------------------------------------------------------------
   To retrieve a file by ftp from a Unix/Internet site, type either:
ftp princeton.edu
   or
ftp 128.112.128.1
   When you are asked for your login, type:
anonymous
   Enter password as per instructions (make sure to include the specified @),
   and then change directories with:
cd /pub/harnad
   To show the available files, type:
ls
   Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example):
get bbs.tomasello
   When you have the file(s) you want, type:
quit

   Certain non-Unix/Internet sites have a facility you can use that is
   equivalent to the above. Sometimes the procedure for connecting to
   princeton.edu will be a two step process such as:

ftp
   followed at the prompt by:
open princeton.edu
  or
open 128.112.128.1

   In case of doubt or difficulty, consult your system manager.

----------

   JANET users who do not have an ftp facilty for interactive file
   transfer (this requires a JIPS connection on your local machine -
   consult your system manager if in doubt) can use a similar facility
   available at JANET site UK.AC.NSF.SUN (numeric equivalent
   000040010180), logging in using 'guestftp' as both login and
   password. The online help information gives details of the transfer
   procedure which is similar to the above. The file received on the
   NSF.SUN machine needs to be transferred to your home machine to read
   it, which can be done either using a 'push' command on the NSF.SUN
   machine, or (usually faster) by initiating the file transfer from
   your home machine. In the latter case the file on the NSF.SUN machine
   must be referred to as directory-name/filename (the directory name to
   use being that provided by you when you logged on to UK.AC.NSF.SUN).
   To be sociable (since NSF.SUN is short of disc space), once you have
   received the file on your own machine you should delete the file from
   the UK.AC.NSF.SUN machine.

   This facility is very often overloaded, and an off-line relay
   facility at site UK.AC.FT-RELAY (which is simpler to use in any
   case) can be used as an alternative. The process is almost identical
   to file transfer within JANET, and the general method is illustrated
   in the following example. With some machines, filenames and the
   username need to be placed within quotes to prevent unacceptable
   transposion to upper case (as may apply also to the transfer from
   NSF.SUN described above).

transfer
Send or Fetch: f
From Remote Filename: princeton.edu:/pub/harnad/bbs.tomasello
To Local Filename: bbs.tomasello
Remote Sitename: uk.ac.ft-relay
Remote Username: anonymous
Remote Password: [enter your full email address including userid for
                  this, or it won't be accepted]
Queue this request? y


   Or if you wish you can get a listing of the available files, by giving
   the remote filename as:

princeton.edu:(D)/pub/harnad

   Because of traffic delays through the FT-RELAY, still another method
   can sometimes be recommended, which is to use the Princeton bitftp
   fileserver described below. Typically, one sends a mail message of
   the form:

FTP princeton.edu UUENCODE
USER anonymous
LS /pub/harnad
GET /pub/harnad/bbs.tomasello
QUIT

   (the line beginning LS is required only if you need a listing of
   available files) to email address BITFTP@EARN.PUCC or to
   BITFTP@EDU.PRINCETON, and receives the requested file in the form of
   one or more email messages.

   [Thanks to Brian Josephson (BDJ10@UK.AC.CAM.PHX) for the above
   detailed UK/JANET instructions; similar special instructions for file
   retrieval from other networks or countries would be appreciated and
   will be included in updates of these instructions.]

---

Where the above procedures are not available (e.g. from Bitnet or other
networks), there are two fileservers:
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
       and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet
that will do the transfer for you. To one or the
other of them, send the following one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

	                      AAAI SPRING SYMPOSIUM SERIES
	                           MARCH 23-25, 1992
	                          STANFORD UNIVERSITY

	                             Symposium on
	 
	                     REASONING ABOUT MENTAL STATES: 
	                    FORMAL THEORIES AND APPLICATIONS
	
	
	
	1. Description of the symposium
	
		Researchers in AI often reason informally in a way that involves
	attributing a variety of mental states to machines, and often design
	systems that must be able to reason both about their own mental states and
	those of others.  This kind of reasoning is common in a number of areas,
	including cooperative interfaces for databases, database security,
	planning, tutoring, and especially multi-agent coordination.
	
		Until recently, most formal work on mental states within AI has
	concentrated only on a related pair of notions---knowledge and belief.  In
	the past few years, however, an increasing reliance on a wide variety of
	mentalistic notions in the design and understanding of actual systems has
	led to a broadening of this formal work.  As a result, there now exist
	within AI formal theories of a number of mentalistic notions and their
	close relatives, including: ability, action, choice, commitment, desire,
	intention, goals, obligation, perception.
	
		The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers working
	on formalisms for reasoning about these mentalistic notions, and also
	researchers involved in the design of systems that rely upon or incorporate
	these notions.  We do not wish to exclude innovative work on knowledge and
	belief, especially if it concerns connections with other mental states, but
	do explicitly want to emphasize a wider variety of mental states.  We would
	expect papers on topics such as the following:
	
	  ** Descriptions of systems, architectures, or theories that rely
	explicitly upon reasoning with mentalistic notions (e.g., BDI-style
	planning architectures, multi-agent planners, models of discourse and
	speech acts);
	
	  ** Formalisms for reasoning about particular mentalistic notions within
	particular frameworks (e.g., a dynamic logic for reasoning about intention)
	and comparisons between frameworks (e.g., between representations of action
	in dynamic and temporal logics), or for reasoning about a number of these
	notions and their interactions (e.g., a logic for reasoning about
	intention, belief, obligation, and action);
	
	  ** Formalisms for multi-agent mentalistic reasoning and coordination
	(e.g., reasoning about the beliefs of one agent concerning the intentions
	and beliefs of another);
	
	  ** Realistic (non-idealized) models of these various mental states;
	
	  ** Issues involving the interaction between these various mentalistic
	notions and time (e.g., the temporal persistence of commitment);
	
	  ** Issues concerning the computational relevance of sophisticated
	philosophical theories of mental states, and perhaps also concerning the
	relevance of the recent, detailed models developed within AI for
	philosophical theorizing.
	
		We hope that the symposium will help to focus research on the
	development of precise theories for reasoning about a variety of mental
	states, and also that it can serve as a forum for interaction between those
	working in other areas whose research relies upon these theories and those
	concerned primarily with the logic of the matter.
	
	
	2. Submission and attendance information
	
		Those wishing to present their work for discussion at the symposium
	should submit five physical copies of an extended abstract, no more than
	six pages in length.  (Authors whose work is accepted for presentation will
	later be asked for a full paper to be included in the symposium
	proceedings.)
	
		Those wishing to attend the symposium without presenting work
	should submit a one page statement of their (relevant) research interests.
	
		All submissions and requests for attendance should be sent to
	arrive by October 16 at the following address:

		Inst. for Advanced Computer Studies
		A.V. Williams Building

I apologize in advance if this is the second version of this notice that
you have received.


I am posting a CALL FOR PAPERS that should be of interest to
some members of the SPP.  I am told that the selection committee
would be pleased to receive papers from interested philosophers
and psychologists.


By the way, if you have ideas about possible symposia for the 
1993 meeting of the SPP there is still time to have them
considered, though not much.  E-mail them to me at:

Does anybody know who John Dinsmore is and where he may be reached
(preferably electronically).  I just came across the following:

Dinsmore, John.  The Symbolic and Connectionist Paradigms: Closing

Description of the Institute:

Theorizing about the metaphysics of meaning and intentional content has shaped
much of what is most characteristic of contemporary philosophy of language and
philosophy of mind. This Institute is devoted to a complex of philosophical
questions in this area, including, centrally: whether the individuation of the
contents of thoughts and linguistic expressions  is inherently holistic;
whether, and in what respect, content is individualistic; and whether a
naturalistic theory of content is possible. For example, we will discuss
arguments that are alleged to show that the content of a concept depends on the
entire belief system of which it is a part; arguments that are alleged to show
that the content of a concept is in part constituted by the social or physical
context in which it is acquired; and  arguments that are alleged to show that
attributions of conceptual content are inherently normative. Implications of
these questions about content for other philosophical issues
(such as the status of intentional explanation, the epistemology
of translation and interpretation, and the prospects for
Intentional Realism) will also be explored. Through a series of
lectures and discussions, participants will be introduced to the
best current thought on the nature of content.

During the six weeks, the 25 participants will work with the directors and the
staff in workshops, lectures, and informal discussions. In the first week, we
will begin with questions about the extent to which intentional phenomena are
to be construed as objective features of the natural world. In the second week,
we will discuss the connection between intentional explanation and the
fact/meaning distinction, and the issue of  holism with which it is closely
involved. In the third week, we will consider the problem of meaning from the
point of view of philosophical semantics. The fourth week turns to the
epistemology of interpretation and translation. The fifth week considers role
of cultural and social factors in content attribution. The final week surveys
recent naturalistic theories of meaning.


Eligibility:

Participation is limited to full-time senior or junior faculty teaching in
colleges and universities in the United States. Foreign citizens who have been
teaching at a college or university in this country for at least three years
are also eligible. Part-time instructors and graduate students are not
eligible.


Stipend:

Each of the 25 participants accepted to this Summer Institute will receive a
stipend of $1500, and is expected to devote full-time to its activities through
the six weeks. In addition, there will be an allowance toward the cost of room,
board, and travel.


Housing:

Participants may live on campus in dormitories, the option of meals in a
residential college.  We will also help in making arrangements for off-campus
housing.


Application Procedure:

Applications should be submitted as soon as possible, and should be received no
later than March 1, 1993. Acceptances will be announced no later than March 21,
1993. There is no application form, but applicants are requested to assemble
two copies of the following items:

1. A curriculum vitae showing teaching experience, publications, present
position, social security number, home and office telephone numbers (and a fax
number and e-mail address, if available), home address, and the names of two

CO-EVOLUTION OF NEOCORTEX SIZE, GROUP SIZE AND LANGUAGE IN HUMANS

                    R.I.M. Dunbar
       Human Evolutionary Biology Research Group
            Department of Anthropology

KEYWORDS: Neocortical size, group size, humans, language,
Macchiavellian Intelligence

ABSTRACT: Group size is a function of relative neocortical volume in
nonhuman primates. Extrapolation from this regression equation yields a
predicted group size for modern humans very similar to that of certain
hunter-gatherer and traditional horticulturalist societies. Groups of
similar size are also found in other large-scale forms of contemporary
and historical society. Among primates, the cohesion of groups is
maintained by social grooming; the time devoted to social grooming is
linearly related to group size among the Old World monkeys and apes. To
maintain the stability  of the large groups characteristic of humans by
grooming alone would place intolerable demands on time budgets. It is
suggested that (1) the evolution of large groups in the human lineage
depended on the development of a more efficient method for time-sharing
the processes of social bonding and that (2) language uniquely fulfills
this requirement. Data on the size of conversational and other small
interacting groups of humans are in line with the predictions for the
relative efficiency of conversation compared to grooming as a bonding
process. Analysis of a sample of human conversations shows that about
60% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal
experiences. It is suggested that language evolved to allow individuals
to learn about the behavioural characteristics of other group members
more rapidly than is possible by direct observation alone.

   Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example):
get bbs.dunbar
   When you have the file(s) you want, type:
quit

   Certain non-Unix/Internet sites have a facility you can use that is
   equivalent to the above. Sometimes the procedure for connecting to
   princeton.edu will be a two step process such as:

ftp
   followed at the prompt by:
open princeton.edu
  or
open 128.112.128.1

   In case of doubt or difficulty, consult your system manager.

----------

   JANET users who do not have an ftp facilty for interactive file
   transfer (this requires a JIPS connection on your local machine -
   consult your system manager if in doubt) can use a similar facility
   available at JANET site UK.AC.NSF.SUN (numeric equivalent
   000040010180), logging in using 'guestftp' as both login and
   password. The online help information gives details of the transfer
   procedure which is similar to the above. The file received on the
   NSF.SUN machine needs to be transferred to your home machine to read
   it, which can be done either using a 'push' command on the NSF.SUN
   machine, or (usually faster) by initiating the file transfer from
   your home machine. In the latter case the file on the NSF.SUN machine
   must be referred to as directory-name/filename (the directory name to
   use being that provided by you when you logged on to UK.AC.NSF.SUN).
   To be sociable (since NSF.SUN is short of disc space), once you have
   received the file on your own machine you should delete the file from
   the UK.AC.NSF.SUN machine.

   This facility is very often overloaded, and an off-line relay
   facility at site UK.AC.FT-RELAY (which is simpler to use in any
   case) can be used as an alternative. The process is almost identical
   to file transfer within JANET, and the general method is illustrated
   in the following example. With some machines, filenames and the
   username need to be placed within quotes to prevent unacceptable
   transposion to upper case (as may apply also to the transfer from
   NSF.SUN described above).

transfer
Send or Fetch: f
From Remote Filename: princeton.edu:/pub/harnad/BBS/bbs.dunbar
To Local Filename: bbs.dunbar
Remote Sitename: uk.ac.ft-relay
Remote Username: anonymous
Remote Password: [enter your full email address including userid for
                  this, or it won't be accepted]
Queue this request? y


   Or if you wish you can get a listing of the available files, by giving
   the remote filename as:

princeton.edu:(D)/pub/harnad/BBS

   Because of traffic delays through the FT-RELAY, still another method
   can sometimes be recommended, which is to use the Princeton bitftp
   fileserver described below. Typically, one sends a mail message of
   the form:

FTP princeton.edu UUENCODE
USER anonymous
LS /pub/harnad/BBS
GET /pub/harnad/BBS/bbs.dunbar
QUIT

   (the line beginning LS is required only if you need a listing of
   available files) to email address BITFTP@EARN.PUCC or to
   BITFTP@EDU.PRINCETON, and receives the requested file in the form of
   one or more email messages.

   [Thanks to Brian Josephson (BDJ10@UK.AC.CAM.PHX) for the above
   detailed UK/JANET instructions; similar special instructions for file
   retrieval from other networks or countries would be appreciated and
   will be included in updates of these instructions.]

---

Where the above procedures are not available (e.g. from Bitnet or other
networks), there are two fileservers:
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
       and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet
that will do the transfer for you. To one or the
other of them, send the following one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

1993 NEH Summer Seminar for College Teachers 
At Stanford University

Director:  Michael Bratman, Professsor of Philosophy
Stanford University
June 21- July 31, 1993

INTENTION

This seminar will study a range of diverging conceptions of intention
as these have been developed in recent work in the philosophy of mind
and action, and moral philosophy.  Among the questions we will
consider are: What is intention? What is intentional action? How are
intentional actions related to intentions to act?  How is intention
related to desire? to belief? to evaluation? to plans and planning?
to aims?  We will explore ways in which different approaches to
intention lead to and support different conceptions of practical
rationality, practical reasoning, and intelligent agency.  And we will
explore several related areas of contemporary philosophical debate,
including debates about the principle of double effect, deterrent
intentions, and shared intentions.
	The seminar is designed primarily for college  teachers of
philosophy with interests in these issues.  Such an interest may come
from a wide range of areas of philosophy, including, but not limited
to:   philosophy of mind and action, moral philosophy, philosophy of
law, philosophy of social science, philosophy of language, foundations
of decision theory, and philosophical concerns about artificial
intelligence.  The seminar  may also be of interest to those who work
in related disciplines and want to explore foundational issues about
intention. 
	The seminar will be held at  the Center for the Study of
Language and Information, an inter-disciplinary research center   at
Stanford University with close ties to the Stanford Philosophy
Department.  

Stipend: $3200

 SPECIES AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNICATION BASED ON PRIVATE STATES

ABSTRACT: The way people come to report to one another about private
stimulation (e.g., feeling states) arising within their own bodies is
not well understood. Although the Darwinian assumption of phylogenetic
continuity between species has been the basis of animal modeling for
many human biological and behavioral phenomena, few models exist for
human communication based on private stimulation. This target article
describes such an animal model drawing upon concepts and methods from the
study of discriminative stimulus effects of drugs and recent research
on interanimal communication. We discuss how humans acquire the
capacity to identify and report private stimulation. Intra- and
interspecific differences are also discussed, including constitutional
individual differences in neurochemical mechanisms for transducing
interoceptive stimuli, enzymatic and other metabolic differences,
differences in learning ability, and general differences in
discrimination learning histories, along with their relation to
psychiatric and developmental disabilities.

KEYWORDS: private events, communication, verbal behavior, animal
models, emotions, drug states, animal communication, experimental
analysis of behavior, autism, language, symbols

                          IJCAI-93  WORKSHOP  ON
                  CONDITIONALS IN KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
                          August 28,29 or 30, 1993

                   To be held in conjunction with IJCAI-93
                       August 29 -- September 3, 1993
                              Chambery, France

Recently, conditional logics and conditional representations have
become popular in formal knowledge representation (KR). These
approaches have found application in areas including default
and probabilistic reasoning, reasoning about action, belief
revision and deontic reasoning. The purpose of this workshop is
to bring together researchers from these different areas in order
to explore the common ground shared by these approaches. The
workshop will focus on formal methods and logics for conditional
reasoning, the semantics of such systems (including probabilistic
semantics), connections that exist between various systems,
problems associated with the use of conditionals, and the application
of conditional schemes to the representation of different kinds
of knowledge.

Topics of interest include: conditional logics for default reasoning,
belief revision and update, probabilistic reasoning, and deontic reasoning;
semantic models of conditionals and common foundations; standard and
non-standard probabilistic semantics for conditionals; the role of
decision theory in the semantics of conditionals; nonmonotonic
consequence relations and default reasoning with conditionals; the
relationship to ``classical'' default schemes (e.g. default logic);
nested conditionals; and applications to specific representation
problems (e.g., abduction, reasoning about action, planning,
causal reasoning).

To encourage informal interaction and the exchange of ideas, attendance
will be limited to approximately 35 people. Those wishing to attend
are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (of no more than 10
pages) describing relevant unpublished research results to be
presented at the workshop. Others wishing to attend may submit a
short description of their relevant research interests and contributions.
Attendance will be by invitation only. Invited contributors will be
asked to provide complete papers to be distributed as (unpublished)
preprints to the workshop participants. We hope to provide these
to the participants before the workshop.

ABSTRACT: This book proposes a theory of human cognitive evolution,
drawing from paleontology, linguistics, anthropology, cognitive
science, and especially neuropsychology. The properties of humankind's
brain, culture and cognition have co-evolved in a tight loop; the main
event in human evolution has occurred at the cognitive level, however,
mediating change at the anatomical and cultural levels. During the past
two million years humans have passed through three major cognitive
transitions, each of which has left the human mind with a new way of
representing reality and a new form of culture. Modern humans
consequently have three systems of memory representation that were not
available to our closest primate relatives: mimetic skill, language,
and external symbols. These three systems are supported by new types of
"hard" storage devices, two of which (mimetic and linguistic) are
biological, one technological. Full symbolic literacy consists of a
complex of skills for interacting with the external memory system. The
independence of these three uniquely human ways of representing
knowledge is suggested in the way the mind breaks down after brain
injury and confirmed by various other lines of evidence. Each of the
three systems is based on an inventive capacity: and the products of
those capacities--such as languages, symbols, gestures, social rituals
and images--continue to be invented and vetted in the social arena.
Cognitive evolution is not yet complete: the externalization of memory
has altered the actual memory architecture within which humans think.
This is changing the role of biological memory and the way in which the
human brain deploys its resources; it is also changing the form of
modern culture.

           Information about BBS Multiple Book Reviews

The BBS book review procedure is very similar to the BBS commentary
procedure except that it is the book itself, not a target article, that
is under review. (A Precis summarizing the book co-appears with the
reviews and the Author's Response, to permit BBS readers who have not
read the book to assess the exchange, but the reviews address only the
book, not the Precis.)

Reviewers from the United States will be asked to submit a 1000-word
review of the book by February 15 1993 (the BBS schedule allows one
additional week for non-US and overseas reviewers only, i.e., Feb. 23).

           CONTENT AND STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

Your review should not exceed 1000 words; it should have an overall
title (keyword-indexable and substantive, reflecting the content of
your review).

Three double-spaced hard copies must be received by the deadline.
In addition, an email ascii version would be very helpful in addition
to the hard copies. (If this is not possible, a disk with an ascii
version of the text would also be helpful.)

In addition to the indexable title, the commentary should have your
full name and institutional address, as well as your email address. The
hard copies must be double-spaced.

Please leave ample margins (approx 1 inch).

Always double-space references as well as text.

Make sure all names are spelled correctly, authors are listed in proper
order, and dates are correct so that there is no discrepancy.

BBS's address is: 
		     Behavioral and Brain Sciences
		     20 Nassau Street, Room 240
		     Princeton NJ 08542

All contributions will be reviewed. Most are accepted for publication,
but publication cannot be guaranteed. Reviews that are received late or
exceed the length limits also run the risk of not being included in the
first round.

1.0  MODULARITY AND MODULATION IN NEURAL NETWORKS

1.1  This book introduces a new neural network model, CALM, for
categorization and learning in neural networks. CALM is based on ideas
from neurobiology, psychology, and engineering. It defines a neural
network paradigm that is both modular and modulatory. CALM stands for
Categorizing And Learning Module and it may be viewed as a building
block for neural networks. The internal structure of the CALM module is
inspired by the neocortical minicolumn. Several of these modules are
connected to form an initial neural network architecture. Throughout
the book it is argued that modularity is important in overcoming many
of the problems and limitations of current neural networks. Another
pivotal concept in the CALM module is self-induced arousal, which may
modulate the local learning rate and noise level.

1.2  The concept of arousal has roots in both biology and psychology. In
CALM, this concept underlies two different modes of learning:
elaboration learning and activation learning. Mandler and coworkers
have conjectured that these two distinct modes of learning may cause
the dissociation of memory observed in explicit and implicit memory
tasks. A series of simulations of such experiments demonstrates that
arousal-modulated learning and categorization in modular neural
networks can account for experimental results with both normal and
amnesic patients. In the latter case, pathological but psychologically
accurate behavior is produced by "lesioning" the arousal system of the
model. The behavior obtained in this way is similar to that in patients
with hippocampal lesions, suggesting that the hippocampus may form
part of an arousal system in the brain.

1.3  Another application of CALM to psychological modelling shows how a
modular CALM network can learn the word superiority effect for letter
recognition. As an illustrative practical application, a small model is
described that learns to recognize handwritten digits.

2.0  MODULAR NEURAL ARCHITECTURES AND NEUROCOMPUTERS

2.1  The book contains a concise introduction to genetic algorithms, a
new computing method based on the metaphor of biological evolution that
can be used to design network architectures with superior performance.
In particular, it is shown how a genetic algorithm results in a better
architecture for the digit-recognition model.

2.2  In five appendices, the role of modularity in parallel hardware and
software implementations is discussed in some depth. Several hardware
implementations are considered, including a formal analysis of their
efficiency on transputer networks and an overview of a dedicated 400-
processor neurocomputer built by the developers of CALM in cooperation
with Delft Technical University. One of the appendices is dedicated to
a discussion of the requirements of simulators for modular neural
networks.

3.0  CATASTROPHIC INTERFERENCE AND OTHER ISSUES

3.1  The book ends with an evaluation of the psychological and
biological plausibility of CALM models and a discussion of
generalization, representational capacity of modular neural networks,
and catastrophic interference. A series of simulations and a detailed
analysis of Ratcliff's simulations of catastrophic interference show
that in almost all cases interference can be attributed to overlap of
hidden-layer representations across subsequent blocks of stimuli. It is
argued that introducing modularity, or some other form of
semidistributed representations, may reduce interference to a more
psychologically plausible level.

                   PSYCOLOQUY INSTRUCTIONS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 20,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral, cognitive, neural, social, etc.)
All contributions are refereed by members of PSYCOLOQUY's Editorial Board.

Target articles should normally not exceed 500 lines in length
(commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines). All target
articles must have (1) a short abstract (<100 words), (2) an indexable
title, (3) 6-8 indexable keywords, and the (4) author's full name and
institutional address. The submission should be accompanied by (5) a
rationale for soliciting commentary (e.g., why would commentary be
useful and of interest to the field? what kind of commentary do you
expect to elicit?) and (6) a list of potential commentators (with their
email addresses). Commentaries must have indexable titles and the
commentator's full name and institutional address (abstract is
optional). All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries
and responses (see format of already articles articles in PSYCOLOQUY).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

0. KEYWORDS: comprehension, cognitive processes, sentence comprehension,
             psycholinguistics

1. Language can be viewed as a specialized skill involving
language-specific processes and language-specific mechanisms. Another
view is that language (both comprehension and production) draws
on many general cognitive processes and mechanisms. According to this
view, some of the same processes and mechanisms involved in producing
and comprehending language are involved in nonlinguistic tasks.

2. This commonality might arise because, as Lieberman (1984) and others
have suggested, language comprehension evolved from nonlinguistic
cognitive skills. Or the commonality might arise simply because the
mind is best understood by reference to a common architecture (e.g., a
connectionist architecture).

3. I have adopted the view that many of the processes and mechanisms
involved in language comprehension are general ones. This book
describes a few of those cognitive processes and mechanisms, using a
simple framework -- the Structure Building Framework -- as a guide.

4. According to the Structure Building Framework, the goal of
comprehension is to build a coherent mental representation or
"structure" of the information being comprehended. Several component
processes are involved. First, comprehenders lay foundations for their
mental structures. Next, they develop their mental structures by
mapping on information when that incoming information coheres with the
previous information. If the incoming information is less coherent,
however, comprehenders engage in another cognitive process: They shift
to initiate a new substructure. So, most representations comprise
several branching substructures.

5. The building blocks of these mental structures are memory nodes.
Memory nodes are activated by incoming stimuli. Initial activation
forms the foundation of mental structures. Once the foundation is laid,
subsequent information is often mapped onto a developing structure
because the more coherent the incoming information is with the previous
information, the more likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. In
contrast, the less coherent the incoming information is, the less
likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. In this case, the
incoming information might activate a different set of nodes, and the
activation of this other set of nodes forms the foundation for a new
substructure.

6. Once memory nodes are activated, they transmit processing signals,
either to enhance (boost or increase) or to suppress (dampen or
decrease) other nodes' activation. In other words, two mechanisms
control the memory nodes' level of activation: Enhancement and
Suppression. Memory nodes are enhanced when the information they
represent is necessary for further structure building. They are
suppressed when the information they represent is no longer as
necessary.

7. This book describes the three subprocesses involved in structure
building, namely: the Process of Laying a Foundation for mental
structures; the Process of Mapping coherent information onto developing
structures; and the Process of Shifting to initiate new substructures.
The book also describes the two mechanisms that control these
structure building processes, namely: the Mechanism of Enhancement,
which increases activation, and the Mechanism of Suppression, which
dampens activation.

8. in discussing these processes and mechanisms, I begin by describing
the empirical evidence to support them. I then describe comprehension
phenomena that result from them. At each point, I stress that I assume
that these processes and mechanisms are general; that is, the same ones
should underlie nonlinguistic phenomena. This suggests that some of the
bases of individual differences in comprehension skill might not be
language specific. I describe how I have investigated this hypothesis
empirically.

9. The process of laying a foundation is described in Chapter 2.
Because comprehenders first lay a foundation, they spend more time
reading the first word of a clause or sentence, the first sentence of a
paragraph or story episode, and the first word of a spoken clause or
spoken sentence; they also spend more time viewing the first picture of
a picture story or picture story episode.

10. Comprehenders use these first segments (initial words, sentences,
and pictures) to lay foundations for their mental representations of
larger units (sentences, paragraphs, and story episodes). Because
laying a foundation consumes cognitive effort, comprehenders slow down
in understanding initial segments. Indeed, none of these comprehension
time effects emerges when the information does not lend itself to
building cohesive mental representations, for example, when the
sentences, paragraphs, or stories are self-embedded or scrambled.

11. The process of laying a foundation explains why comprehenders are
more likely to recall a sentence when cued by its first content word
(or a picture of that first content word); why they are more likely to
recall a story episode when cued by its first sentence; and why they
are more likely to consider the first sentence of a paragraph the main
idea of that paragraph, even when the actual theme occurs later.

12. Initial words, sentences, and pictures are optimal cues because
they form the foundations of their clause-level, sentence-level, and
episode-level structures; only through initial words, sentences, and
pictures can later words, sentences, and pictures be mapped onto the
developing representation.

13. Laying a foundation explains why comprehenders access the
participant mentioned first in a clause faster than they access a
participant mentioned later. This Advantage of First Mention occurs
regardless of the first-mentioned participant's syntactic position or
semantic role. First-mentioned participants are more accessible because
they form the foundation of their clause-level substructures.

14. Laying a foundation also explains why the first clause of a
multi-clause sentence is most accessible shortly after comprehenders
hear or read that multi-clause sentence (even though while they are
hearing or reading the sentence, the most recent clause is most
accessible). According to the Structure Building Framework,
comprehenders represent each clause of a multi-clause sentence in its
own substructure. Although they have greatest access to the information
that is represented in the substructure that they are currently
developing, at some point, the first clause becomes most accessible
because the substructure representing the first clause forms the
foundation for the whole sentence-level structure.

15. The processes of mapping and shifting are described in Chapter 3.
The process of mapping explains why sentences that refer to previously
mentioned concepts (and are, therefore, referentially coherent) are
read faster than less referentially coherent sentences; why sentences
that maintain a previously established time frame (and are, therefore,
temporally coherent) are read faster than sentences that are less
temporally coherent; why sentences that maintain a previously
established location or point of view (and are, therefore, locationally
coherent) are read faster than sentences that are less locationally
coherent; and why sentences that are logical consequences of previously
mentioned actions (and are, therefore, causally coherent) are read
faster than sentences that are less causally coherent.

16. The process of shifting from actively building one substructure to
initiating another explains why words and sentences that change the
topic, point of view, location, or temporal setting take substantially
longer to comprehend. The process of shifting also explains why
information presented before a change in topic, point of view,
location, or temporal setting is harder to retrieve than information
presented afterward. Such changes trigger comprehenders to shift and
initiate a new substructure; information presented before comprehenders
shift is not represented in the same substructure as information
presented afterward.

17. Shifting also explains a well known language comprehension
phenomenon: Comprehenders quickly forget the exact form of recently
comprehended information. This phenomenon is not unique to language; it
also occurs while comprehenders are viewing picture stories; and it is
also exacerbated after comprehenders cross episode boundaries, even the
episode boundaries of picture stories.

18. Finally, shifting explains why comprehenders' memories for stories
are organized by the episodes in which the stories were originally
heard or read. Comprehenders shift in response to cues that signal a
new episode; each episode is hence represented in a separate
substructure.

19. The mechanisms of suppression and enhancement are described in
Chapter 4. The suppression mechanism explains why only the contextually
appropriate meaning of an ambiguous word, such as bug, is available to
consciousness although multiple meanings -- even contextually
inappropriate ones -- are often immediately activated. The
inappropriate meanings do not simply decay; neither do they decrease in
activation because their activation is consumed by the appropriate
meanings. Rather, the suppression mechanism dampens the activation of
inappropriate meanings. It also dampens the activation of less relevant
associations of unambiguous words.

20. Suppression and enhancement explain how anaphors (such as pronouns,
repeated noun phrases, and so forth) improve their antecedents'
accessibility. Anaphors both enhance their antecedents' activation and
suppress the activation of other concepts, with the net effect that
after anaphoric reference, antecedents are more activated than other
concepts. They are accordingly more accessible.

21. Suppression and enhancement are triggered by information that
specifies the anaphor's identity. More explicit anaphors trigger more
suppression and enhancement. Information from other sources (such as
semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic context) also triggers suppression,
but it does so less quickly and less powerfully.

22. Suppression and enhancement explain why speakers and writers use
more explicit anaphors at longer referential distances, at the
beginnings of episodes, and for less topical concepts. The mechanisms
of suppression and enhancement also explain why comprehenders have more
difficulty accessing referents at longer referential distances, at the
beginnings of episodes, and for less topical concepts.

23. Suppression and enhancement explain how concepts marked with
cataphoric devices, like spoken stress and the indefinite article,
"this," gain a privileged status in comprehenders' mental
representations. Cataphoric devices enhance the activation of the
concepts they mark. They also improve their concepts' representational
status through the suppression: Concepts marked with cataphoric devices
are better at suppressing the activation of other concepts, and they
are better at resisting being suppressed themselves.

24. Finally, the mechanisms of suppression and enhancement explain why
comprehenders typically forget surface information faster than they
forget thematic information; why comprehenders forget more surface
information after they hear or read thematically organized passages
than after they hear or read seemingly unrelated sentences; and why
comprehenders better remember the surface forms of abstract sentences
and the thematic content of concrete sentences.

25. Individual differences in structure building are described in
Chapter 5. The Structure Building Framework explains why skill in
comprehending linguistic media (written and spoken stories) is closely
related to skill in comprehending nonlinguistic media (picture
stories). Comprehensible information, regardless of its medium, is
structured, and comprehenders differ in how skillfully they use the
cognitive processes and mechanisms that capture this structure.

26. The process of shifting explains why less-skilled comprehenders are
poorer at remembering recently comprehended information: They shift too
often. The mechanism of suppression explains why less-skilled
comprehenders are less able to reject the contextually inappropriate
meanings of ambiguous words; why they are less able to reject the
incorrect forms of homophones; why they are less able to reject the
typical-but-absent members of nonverbal scenes; why they are less able
to ignore words written on pictures; and why they are less able to
ignore pictures surrounding words: Less-skilled comprehenders have
inefficient suppression mechanisms.

27. The distinction between the mechanisms of suppression and
enhancement explains why less-skilled comprehenders are not less able
to appreciate the contextually appropriate meanings of ambiguous words
and why they are not less able to appreciate typical members of
nonverbal scenes. It is less-skilled comprehenders' suppression
mechanisms, not their enhancement mechanisms, that are faulty.

28. Although the Structure Building Framework accounts parsimoniously 
for many comprehension phenomena, several questions remain unanswered.
In the final chapter, I briefly identify just a few of those questions:
Are the cognitive processes and mechanisms indentified by the Structure
Building Framework automatic, or are they under comprehenders'
conscious control? In what medium are mental structures and
substructures represented? How is the Structure Building Framework
similar to other approaches to describing comprehension? And what is
lost by describing language comprehension at a general level?

29. I conclude that by describing language comprehension using the
Structure Building Framework as a guide, I am not forced to accept
nativism, to isolate the psychology of language from the remainder of
psychology, to honor theory over data, to depend on linguistic theory,
or to ignore functionalism. Instead, by describing language
comprehension as structure building, I hope to map the study of
language comprehension onto the firm foundation of cognitive
psychology.

useful and of interest to the field? what kind of commentary do you
expect to elicit?) and (6) a list of potential commentators (with their
email addresses). Commentaries must have indexable titles and the
commentator's full name and institutional address (abstract is
optional). All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries
and responses (see format of already articles articles in PSYCOLOQUY).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

                          CALL FOR PAPERS

Several disciplines share an interest in understanding the concept of
expertise. For instance, computerized "expert systems" form the best known
applications of AI (artificial intelligence), in fact, the concept of an
'expert system' has become so prevalent that many people have come to
equate the whole of AI with them. But what is the expertise that expert
systems can be said to have? This raises many questions. The workshop will
focus on the concept of expertise with special emphasis on implications for
the AI and cognitive science research communities.

Some interpret the history, philosophy, and sociology of science as
challenging the confidence we have placed in our traditional methods of
generating knowledge. For example, history informs us that knowledge is
highly fragile, that it is at the mercy of shifts in historical context,
and that yesterday's experts are today's museum pieces. So how can we have
high confidence in modern expertise? Expertise develops, and is labeled as
such, in a social context. Nevertheless, we all act as if we believe that
some expert knowledge is more than merely social construction. What is the
relation between the individual and group processes involved in knowledge
in general and expertise in particular? What is the relation between the
acquisition of individual expertise and the acquisition of group expertise,
for example, by a firm or industry? 

Recent work in psychology has focused on the cognitive strategies that
separate novices from experts, and the mechanisms by which expertise is
acquired. Fundamental debates in statistics and psychology have concerned
the measurement and assessment of expertise. What (if anything) do the
empirical tools of psychology and the observational skills of
ethnomethodology tell us about expertise and how it is acquired? How does
'expertise' differ from mere 'knowledge'? Do the differences have to do
with skill level? With domain? With social practices concerning deference,
respect or authority? How can expertise be assessed and compared? Can
experts be calibrated? What is required for a domain to admit expertise at
all? 

And finally, what are the specific implications of various theories of
expertise for those engaged in the design and construction of
knowledge-based systems? What are the representational ramifications for
the knowledge engineer of the widespread observation that expert reasoning
seems to differ qualitatively from novice reasoning? How are the computer
instantiations of expertise related to human expertise and knowledge? Some
work in machine learning is aimed at developing systems that independently
acquire expertise by use of statistical or inductive methods - can this be
said to be expertise?

The workshop on "Expertise in Context: Human & Machine" will bring together
researchers from diverse areas to consider these important questions. Other
topics of interest include the following:

        Situated cognition & expertise  
        Are experts Bayesian? 
        Novice-expert shift     
        Cognitive models of expertise
        Issues of expert bias   
        Expertise as an attribution
        Expertise &  negative metaknowledge  
        Constructivist vs. Realist views of expertise 
        Episodic memory and expertise   
        Expertise for animal intelligences only?

The workshop will be kept small - about 45 participants. In general,
attendance will be limited to those presenting their work: one author per
paper. The contribution of each presenter will be considered for inclusion
as a chapter in a subsequent edited volume. Three copies of an extended
abstract (from 5 to 8 pages) should be sent to Ken Ford (address below)
before February 28, 1993.

Subject: Colorado Boycott & Cognitive Science Conference
Sender: spp-request@umiacs.UMD.EDU

The Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society is aware of the
recent approval by the voters of Colorado of an amendment to
their Constitution that bans antidiscriminatory legal activity to
protect the rights of gays and lesbians (the amendment has been barred
from implementation pending judicial review).  This action has prompted
calls for a boycott of the state.  Since the Annual Meeting of the
Society is scheduled for June 18-21 in Boulder, we feel obliged to make
it clear that our action in no way implies an endorsement of the
amendment nor disapproval of means being taken to oppose it.  We are a
small society with no professional convention staff.  A
last-minute change would produce great expense for members, who often
pay their own way.  Further, the logistics of conferences make
it impossible to make a change now without causing considerable pain to
hundreds of people who were not a party to the vote in
Colorado. 

Here are additional reasons for our decision to continue with the meeting.

* Boulder is one of the cities whose gay rights ordinance is
threatened, and the City of Boulder was the primary party in the
injunction suit (and thus in preventing immediate implementation).

* The University of Colorado where the conference will be held has
a policy of non-discrimination (including sexual preference)
towards employees.  (It could be strengthened, many believe)

* Unlike most annual meetings this one is run entirely by the local
committee, so that moving the meeting really means starting
over from scratch.

* A number of gay-rights organizations in Colorado are now OPPOSING
the Boycott.


Personally, the members of the Governing Board oppose the Colorado
amendment.  There is a strong precedent to avoid involving the
Society in political issues, and our action in making this statement is
primarily to avoid any suggestion that by not changing the meeting,
we are opposing the boycott or endorsing the amendment.  Obviously,
setting any further meetings in Colorado after this June would
itself be a political action in the current context, and thus is
unlikely.  Further, members are free to offer resolutions at the general
membership meeting held during the conference (within the limits of our
by-laws and corporate charter).

Individual members, of course, may wish to take stronger steps.  For
example, they may wish to donate to one or more groups specifically
opposing the amendment, including the groups listed at the end of this
posting.

Approved by electronic mail poll of the Governing Board.

I have passed on a suggestion to CHI'95 which I will also share
with Cognitive Science.

Although it is infeasible to redirect a conference at a late date,
it is not infeasible to make a statement with the conference.  

For example.

(1) Collection of funds as an extra at the conference to donate to
    one of the political action groups.  This can be an additional
    collection at registration.

(2) Permission for political action groups to have a booth at 
    conference for purpose of collecting funds, distributing 
    literature, etc.

(3) Diversion of percentage of conference funds to support 
    political activity against discrimination law.

This makes a positive statement about holding the conference in
Colorado and does not hurt Boulder or Denver who resoundingly
voted against the law and who are taking action within their
city governments to continue to support anti-discrimination.

Some of the above items depend on the society's tax status, but
different variations can be worked out.

ABSTRACT: According to a simple form of "consequentialism," our
decisions should be based on our judgments of their consequences for
achieving our goals. Our goals give each of us reason to endorse
consequentialism as a standard of decision making. Alternative decision
standards are bound to compromise goal attainment by leading to
consequences that are not as good in the consequentialist sense. In
reality, however, some people knowingly follow decision rules that
violate consequentialism. For example, they prefer harmful
failures-to-act over less harmful acts; they favor the status-quo over
alternatives that they would otherwise judge to be better; they are
prepared to approve third-party compensation on the basis of the cause
of an injury rather than the benefit from the compensation; they ignore
deterrent effects in decisions about punishment; and they resist
coercive reforms even when they judge that they would be beneficial. I
suggest that nonconsequentialist principles arise from an
overgeneralization of rules that are consistent with consequentialism
in a limited set of cases. Commitment to such rules is detached from
their original purposes. The existence of such nonconsequentialist
decision biases has implications for philosophical and experimental
methodology, the relation between psychology and public policy, and
education.

   NSF.SUN machine needs to be transferred to your home machine to read
   it, which can be done either using a 'push' command on the NSF.SUN
   machine, or (usually faster) by initiating the file transfer from
   your home machine. In the latter case the file on the NSF.SUN machine
   must be referred to as directory-name/filename (the directory name to
   use being that provided by you when you logged on to UK.AC.NSF.SUN).
   To be sociable (since NSF.SUN is short of disc space), once you have
   received the file on your own machine you should delete the file from
   the UK.AC.NSF.SUN machine.

   This facility is very often overloaded, and an off-line relay
   facility at site UK.AC.FT-RELAY (which is simpler to use in any
   case) can be used as an alternative. The process is almost identical
   to file transfer within JANET, and the general method is illustrated
   in the following example. With some machines, filenames and the
   username need to be placed within quotes to prevent unacceptable
   transposion to upper case (as may apply also to the transfer from
   NSF.SUN described above).

transfer
Send or Fetch: f
>From Remote Filename: princeton.edu:/pub/harnad/BBS/bbs.baron
To Local Filename: bbs.baron
Remote Sitename: uk.ac.ft-relay
Remote Username: anonymous
Remote Password: [enter your full email address including userid for
                  this, or it won't be accepted]
Queue this request? y


   Or if you wish you can get a listing of the available files, by giving
   the remote filename as:

princeton.edu:(D)/pub/harnad/BBS

   Because of traffic delays through the FT-RELAY, still another method
   can sometimes be recommended, which is to use the Princeton bitftp
   fileserver described below. Typically, one sends a mail message of
   the form:

FTP princeton.edu UUENCODE
USER anonymous
LS /pub/harnad/BBS
GET /pub/harnad/BBS/bbs.baron
QUIT

   (the line beginning LS is required only if you need a listing of
   available files) to email address BITFTP@EARN.PUCC or to
   BITFTP@EDU.PRINCETON, and receives the requested file in the form of
   one or more email messages.

   [Thanks to Brian Josephson (BDJ10@UK.AC.CAM.PHX) for the above
   detailed UK/JANET instructions; similar special instructions for file
   retrieval from other networks or countries would be appreciated and
   will be included in updates of these instructions.]

---

Where the above procedures are not available (e.g. from Bitnet or other
networks), there are two fileservers:
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
       and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet
that will do the transfer for you. To one or the
other of them, send the following one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

        Commentary on Wallis on Fodor-Representation

1.  According to Wallis (1992), philosophers of mind agree that a
successful theory of representation must "describe conditions for
representation in nonintentional and nonsemantic terms." If we restrict
representation talk to what goes on in frogs, the visual systems of
humans, etc., then perhaps Wallis is right. But once we count beliefs
as representations, there is no such agreement. Indeed, Fodor's (e.g.,
1990) position is tendentious -- and therefore interesting (pace
Wallis's remark in 2.5) -- precisely because Fodor argues (a) that
beliefs are representations (in a broad sense of the term) and (b) that
the relation beliefs bear to their truth conditions can be
characterized in nonsemantic terms.

2.  Fodor is not committed to applying his account of truth conditions
for beliefs to all representations, however. And it would be
implausible for him to do so. For Fodor is attempting to provide a
"naturalistic" account of what Grice (1957) called "non-natural"
meaning. If all representations satisfied Fodor's proposed sufficient
condition, Fodor would be committed to the view that no representations
have only what Grice called "natural" meaning. But at least many
philosophers-- Fodor among them-- have held that there is an important
difference between the internal states of frogs (etc.) and "fully"
intentional entities like beliefs, desires, etc. Fodor's asymmetric
dependence theory is supposed to capture this difference. But his
theory is fully compatible with some other account (e.g., that of
Dretske (1981)) of Grice's "natural meaning" as it applies to entities
(other than beliefs) that cognitive scientists often characterize as
representational. Thus, much of Wallis' criticism strikes me as
misdirected.

3.  More interesting is Wallis's barn example (5.5-5.8). Fodor's theory
is supposed to apply, for example, to the belief I might express by
saying, "Yonder lies a barn." Let us call tokens of this belief type
"B-tokens." Details aside, Fodor's idea is that the false depends on
the true, but not conversely. And Fodor is indeed committed to saying
that breaking the barn/B-token connection will break the
facsimile/B-token connection but breaking the facsimile/B-token
connection need not break the barn/B-token connection. Wallis's
example, however, at least as stated, presents no difficulty for
Fodor.

4.  First, one cannot KNOW (pace Wallis) that (all) large red buildings
having extended rectangular bodies are barns, and I doubt that anyone
even BELIEVES this, although it may be that agents are disposed to
produce B-tokens in the presence of large red buildings having an
extended rectangular body. (What agents BELIEVE, I take it, depends
not merely on how they are disposed to react to stimuli, but also on
whether they are disposed to "change their mind" in the light of new
stimuli.) Wallis claims that breaking the facsimile/B-token connection
by breaking the large-red-(etc.)/B-token connection will also break the
barn/B-token connection. But this will be so only if the agent's sole
route from barns to B-tokens is via the agent's large-red-(etc.)/B-token
connection. Fodor's intuition (and mine), however, is that such an
impoverished conception of a barn would not yield beliefs that
"non-naturally" mean that yonder lies a barn. And given an agent with
genuine barn-beliefs, there will be many ways to break the
facsimile/B-token connection.

5.  Suppose agents come to believe (because they look closely) that the
building in question is only an inch deep. This will break the
large-red-(etc.)/B-token connection, at least for the object at hand,
without breaking the barn/B-token connection. But agents with genuine
barn-beliefs can still come to form a (true) B-token because they are
presented with a large-red-(etc.) object. Breaking such agents'
barn/B-token connection would break their facsimile/B-token connection,
but not conversely. For breaking their barn/B-token connection requires
breaking their large-red-(etc.)/B-token connection, but not conversely.

6.  Fodor claims that if instantiations of a property Q can cause
tokens of the representational type B, where B-tokens have Gricean
"non-natural" meaning, then either (i) the instantiation of Q is a
truth condition for B-tokens or (ii) instantiations of Q can cause
B-tokens only because instantiations of P can cause B-tokens, but not
conversely, where the instantiation of P is a truth condition for
B-tokens. Wallis's cases fall into two classes: those involving
representational states that do not have non-natural meaning, and those
not in conflict with (ii) above. Fodor's theory may be flawed -- see,
e.g., the articles in Loewer and Rey (1991) -- but not, I think, for
the reasons Wallis suggests.

    KEYWORDS: cognitive science, Fodor, intentionality, mind/body
    problem, representation

1.0  INTRODUCTION

1.1  The focus of Wallis (1992) is a critique of Fodor's theory of
mental representation. In this commentary, I discuss some foundational
issues that, I believe, Wallis has passed over too quickly. In
particular, I will focus on (a) the importance of representation for
Fodor's project in particular and (b) some issues surrounding the role
of representation in cognitive science in general.

2.0  FODOR'S PROJECT

2.1  In paragraph 1.3, Wallis claims that a naturalized theory of
representation that was consistent with the findings of cognitive
science would "clarify the representation relation and its role in
explanation in cognitive science and would make an important
contribution to solving the mind/body problem." In this section, I want
to argue that a naturalized theory of mental representation, with
respect to Fodor's project, is much more important than Wallis
suggests.

2.2  Our behavior results, in large part, from the workings of the
brain. The brain, of course, is a physical device, and so
transformations among brain states are causal transformations governed
by causal laws. As such, causal transformations from one state to
another occur because of certain properties, such as the electrical and
chemical properties, of those states, and they do not occur because of
the fact (if it is a fact) that a state represents my grandmother or
corresponds to my belief that I am about to run out of gas. Even if
brain states have representational properties (e.g., the property of
representing my grandmother or gasoline), such properties appear, at
first glance, to be causally inert (Churchland and Churchland 1983;
Fodor 1987).

2.3  In spite of this, Fodor (1975, 1981, 1987) is committed to the view
that representational properties (and intentional properties in
general) are causally efficacious. But since causally efficacious
properties seem to be restricted to naturalistic properties (such as
electrical and chemical properties), Fodor needs to show that, in spite
of initial appearances to the contrary, mental representation is a
naturalistic property after all. In short, Fodor needs a naturalized
theory of mental representation.

2.4  How important is such a theory to Fodor's project? He could, of
course, give up intentional realism -- that is, the view that
representational properties (and intentional properties in general) are
causally efficacious. However, intentional realism has been a
cornerstone of Fodor's career project, so this is not really a live
option.

2.5  Alternatively, Fodor could give up the commitment to the view that
only naturalistic properties can be causally efficacious. However, this
would require a dramatic realignment of Fodor's views on causation.
Such views are also fundamental to his approach, and they have been
largely unchanged at least since Fodor (1975). So this too appears not
to be an acceptable option.

2.6  Given Fodor's commitment to intentional realism and certain
(seemingly plausible) views on causation, the only alternative is to
find a naturalized theory of mental representation. In short, Fodor's
career project is in danger of collapse unless he can provide such a
theory. In this way, Fodor's search for a naturalized theory of mental
representation is not, as Wallis suggests, merely a matter of
clarifying the explanatory role of mental representation and providing
a contribution to the mind/body problem. For Fodor, and many other
intentional realists, it is much more than that.

3.0  REPRESENTATION AND FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES

3.1  For Fodor at least, mental representation provides a problem in
distinct need of a solution. But do those with motivations different
from Fodor's also need to be concerned about puzzles surrounding
representation? Wallis, again in 1.3, suggests that the role of
representation in cognitive science needs clarification, but he says
little more about why this is so. I want to argue that this issue is
potentially more problematic than Wallis and others seem to realize.

3.2  A survey of the literature in cognitive science and related
disciplines will quickly convince one, if one was not convinced
already, of the central explanatory role that representation plays. In
spite of this, or perhaps because of it, there is a widespread
uneasiness concerning representation. Representation and other
intentional concepts just do not seem to be the right sorts of concepts
on which to base explanations. As mentioned in the section above, there
are serious questions about the causal role of intentional properties.
Moreover, at least since the scientific revolution of the 1600s, no
other mainstream scientific theory has used intentional concepts in
such a central role. It would be nice to have a theory of
representation that alleviated such worries about the legitimacy of
using intentional concepts in explanatory roles. This, then, is one
general benefit that would result from an acceptable theory of
representation.

3.3  I turn now to a second and much more fundamental worry
concerning the lack of a naturalized theory of representation. Wallis
has provided a plausible argument to the effect that Fodor's attempt to
give a naturalized theory of mental representation is unacceptable.
Dretske (1981), Millikan (1984), Loar (1982), and many others have
explored different approaches to providing a naturalized account of
mental representation, but these too have come under attack (see
Cummins 1989 for a summary). At present, it is safe to say that there
is no widely accepted naturalistic account of mental representation,
and no genuinely new ideas seem to be on the horizon.

3.4  To see one fundamental puzzle this raises, notice that lacking a
naturalized account of mental representation entails that mental
representation, at present, can only be characterized in terms of
cognitive agents. That is, mental representations are, roughly, those
things that cognitive agents have. In turn, the usual definition of
cognition, and hence of cognitive agents, makes essential use of the
notion of representation (see, e.g., Cheney and Seyfarth 1990). A
tighter circle is rarely found: an understanding of mental
representation presupposes an understanding of cognitive agents, and an
understanding of cognitive agents presupposes an understanding of
mental representation. Thus, two of the fundamental notions of
cognitive science -- mental representation and cognitive agent -- are
threatened by circularity. As with Moliere's virtus dormitiva (Dennett
1991), such circularity is unacceptable.

3.5  This alleged circularity requires more analysis than can properly
be given here. My point, however, is that the lack of an acceptable
account of mental representation is not just an idle puzzle. Rather, it
has important implications for foundational issues in cognitive
science. And these foundational issues are potentially more worrisome
than they are generally given credit for.

3.6  In closing, I want to mention that my intent, especially in this
last section, was not to provide a skeptical argument designed to
undermine cognitive science. Rather, it was to provide commentary on
Wallis's target article and, along the way, suggest some foundational
issues within cognitive science that need further work. That need is, I
think, more urgent than Wallis suggests.

1.0. PIETROSKI

1.1. Pietroski (1993) agrees that Fodor's (1990) theory of mental
representation proves inapplicable to the cited work from cognitive
science. However, Pietroski asserts that Fodor's intent as well as his
commitments require only that he provide a theory of representation for
states like beliefs. Pietroski adds that a different, (possibly)
compatible theory of representation will help one to understand the
work in cognitive science to which I allude. Hence, Pietroski concludes
that by pointing out the inapplicability of Fodor's theory of
representation to vast areas of cognitive science, my target article
(Wallis 1992) is misdirected. For Pietroski, the relevant worry is over
Gricean "non-natural" meaning.

1.2. I worry that philosophers of cognitive science pay too little
attention to actual, Nobel prize winning work in cognitive science.
Equally worrisome is that, on Fodor's account, the outputs of at least
some of these "other" processes are Fodorian beliefs. Indeed,
properties like barnhood are exactly the sort of "inferred
representations" to which Fodor claims to address himself (Fodor 1991,
pp.255-57).  In my target article, I surveyed various contemporary
theories of these "other" processes to see (1) whether any result in Fodor's
brand of mental representation, and (2) just how much explanation one
can do without Fodor's mental representation. I take it that it should
embarrass Fodor that his account does not assign representational
content to the outputs of a process like object recognition given the
best current theory of that process. Pietroski, however, does not share
my worries, so I put aside this disagreement and turn to the barn
example, the one case that Pietroski finds interesting.

1.3. Pietroski suggests (section 5) that Fodor remains unscathed by my
barn case because, "suppose agents come to believe (because they look
closely) that the building in question is only an inch deep. This would
break the large-red-(etc.)/B-token connection, at least for the object
at hand, without breaking the barn/B-token connection."  I find two
problems here. First, if the only way to break the facsimile to Sb
connection is by having another belief (that barns have a depth greater
than one inch, that the object is too thin to be a barn, and/or etc.),
then Fodor becomes a content holist. Second, if one could break the
facsimile to Sb connection without breaking the barn to Sb connection
merely by gaining a new belief about a particular instance, then one
could break the barn to Sb connection without breaking the facsimile to
Sb connection by falsely believing a barn (perhaps because of the
testimony of a friend) to be a facsimile. This last problem is part of
the reason Fodor wants "to do it in terms of nomic relations among
properties rather than causal relations among individuals" (Fodor 1990,
p.102).

1.4. Defining representation in terms of lawlike relations between
properties raises its own potential problems for Fodor that I do not
mention in my article. For a state to have nomic relations between the
property of barnhood and the property of Sb-hood, all manner of barns
must cause Sb. So red barns, green barns, barns shaped like giant
question marks, barns shaped like balls of yarn, etc., must all
cause Sbs. Hence, for Fodor, one cannot recognize red barns as barns
unless one can recognize any instance of a barn as a barn. Fodor might
add a ceteris paribus clause to the law in an attempt to rule out barns
that neither he nor I recognize as barns. I have commented upon the
deficiencies of that strategy elsewhere (Wallis, forthcoming).

1.5. Regardless of the problems (or lack thereof) in appealing to
properties, the appeal to properties does not help with the first
problem: holism. Pietroski, I think, agrees with me that for Sb to
count as a barn representation for Fodor, it must be the case that (A)
one can somehow rule out every kind of facsimile and (B) the mechanism
whereby one rules out facsimiles does not necessitate one's having any
other contentful states (i.e. mental representations). The former, (A),
is required by Fodor's definition. I hold that (B) is necessary for
Fodor to avoid content holism with regard to the mental. Indeed, one
can make the following substitutions into Fodor's definition of content
holism: The language of thought would be content holistic if "no
expression in [the] language [of thought] can have [a content]
unless... at least one other [expression] does" (Fodor & Lepore 1992,
257-260).  As a result, having a belief that "Yonder lies a barn"
cannot require my having other beliefs, such as the belief that "Barns
have a depth greater than one inch."

1.6. Pietroski might offer Fodor's defence against the sort of holism
accusations I raise here and in my target article. Pietroski might note
that Fodor could respond by saying: The functional role (the
beliefs and the inferences one makes from them) does not determine the
content identity of Sb; content identity gets determined by the fact
that the system's tokening of Sbs satisfies the definition for
representation with respect to barns. One gets the bad version of
holism only when one identifies having a content with having some
particular functional role. Fodor might add that he makes appeals to
functional role, but that on his account functional role only mediates the
system's satisfaction of the representational definition with respect
to barns; the functional role does not determine the content. Many
different functional relationships might well mediate the satisfaction
of the definition. So Fodor's account would be holistic, but not in the
bad way, because it does not identify content with some specific
functional role (Fodor, 1991, pp.268-71, 301-3)

1.7. Facsimiles are problems for Fodor precisely because ruling them
out (even to the extent to which humans are capable of doing do) seems
to involve a great deal of knowledge. It is no accident, in my opinion,
that Pietroski finds it relevant that "one cannot KNOW (pace Wallis)
that (all) large red buildings having extended triangular bodies are
barns" (section 4). Fodor/Pietroski have admitted that they need
everything -- the system's entire cognitive apparatus -- in order to
determine mental representational content. In fact, they need the
system and the super-theory by which one could detect all facsimiles.
They need lots and lots of beliefs, most (all?) of which must be true.
False beliefs, or too few beliefs, will let facsimiles slip by. Indeed,
Fodor/Pietroski cannot accept the following scenario involving too
little knowledge: Knowing only that barns are red-extended-triangle-on-
top-of-extended-rectangle buildings in which farmers keep livestock, I
walk out to a good facsimile, and look inside. I see nothing, saying,
"Wow, this barn is sure empty."  I note that the walls are weak and
thin, saying, "Wow, this barn is sure flimsy." I walk away. Nor can
they allow the following scenario involving false belief: I know
incredible amounts about the king. I think about him often in my
dealings with him. I even know that the king has an evil look-alike.
However, I falsely believe that the look-alike, not the king, has a
small birthmark -- their only difference. Fodor must reject this story,
because one can break the king to 'king' connection by revealing the
birthmark without breaking the look-alike to 'king' connection. Hence,
according to Fodor's account I have never thought of the king as the
king. Rather, I think always of the king as the look-alike.

1.8. Are the above scenarios a problem for Fodor?  Consider the following
dark confessions of the Fodorian soul:

   "Now, consider the following (slight) difference between me and my
   almost-Twin; he thinks "You never find water in Pepsi bottles"
   [note deleted] and I don't think this. So then there are likely to
   be environments... in which he would have 'water' thoughts where I
   would not... This is, of course, a real problem for a naturalistic
   semantics; maybe it's the ultimate problem for a naturalistic
   semantics"  (Fodor 1991, p.302).

How, then, might Fodor deal with this problem?

   "I don't want to consider how an informational theory might hope to
   cope with this problem; suffice it to say that you get some room to
   wiggle if you think of the denotation in terms of the nomic
   relations among properties (instead of covariances among their
   instantiations) since you might then argue that the Pepsi guy and
   the non-Pepsi guy are both subsumed by a water 'water' law despite
   the postulated differences between them.  (Remember these are
   ceteris paribus laws." (Fodor 1991, pp.302-303).

In appealing to functional roles, one inherits the problem (from
functional role semantics) of determining the relevant functional roles
for assigning content. So, appealing to functional roles does not
necessarily solve the disjunction problem, as one may have false
beliefs or incomplete sets of beliefs. One therefore cannot determine
the relevant functional roles and hence solve the disjunction problem
simply by somehow resorting to nomic relations among properties (forget
the problems there) and ceteris paribus clauses (forget the problems
there). I conclude that Pietroski has not seen Fodor unscathed, even on
the assumption that Fodor need have nothing to say about my other
cases. I now turn to DeWitt's commentary.

2.0. DEWITT

2.1.  I agree with DeWitt's (1993) claim (section 3.5) that
representation "has important implications for foundational issues in
cognitive science... [a]nd these foundational issues are potentially
more worrisome than they are generally given credit for."  However, I
would defend Fodor and philosophy against the charge that they consider
mental representation "an idle puzzle" (DeWitt, section 3.5).

2.2. DeWitt first raises concerns regarding the causal efficacy of
mental representations given that the physical properties of a system's
state (and not the representational properties) seem to cause a
system's state transitions. I note that the causal status of mental
representations is an instance of the problem of the causal efficacy of
mental properties, a problem faced by dualists (the problem of
interaction between mental and physical substances) and reductive
physicalists alike. Moreover, this problem has not gone unnoticed in
philosophy. A brief list of recent attempts by philosophers to address
this problem would include Cummins (1989), Dretske (1988), Fodor
(1990), Skillen (1984), Sosa (1984), and myself (Wallis, forthcoming).

2.3. DeWitt suggests that Fodor's commitments give him particular
problems as regards the causal efficacy of mental representations; he
concludes that Fodor must find a naturalized theory of mental
representation to save his career project from collapse. It is true
that Fodor needs a naturalized theory of mental representation in order
to make his overall position work. However, a great many philosophers
and cognitive scientists would find their career projects damaged by a
the failure to develop a naturalized theory of mental representation.
Though the causal efficacy of mental representations is a problem, I
find no reason to single out Fodor.

2.4. Turning to DeWitt's allegation of vacuous circularity with regard
to explanations of cognition in terms of mental representation, I think
that even allowing for his necessary brevity he overstates the case.
DeWitt claims (3.4) that lacking a naturalized account "mental
representations are, roughly, those things that cognitive agents have.
In turn, the usual definition of cognition, and hence of cognitive
agents, makes essential use of the notion of representation."  However,
merely lacking a definition (of mental representation) does not commit
one to vacuously circular explanations. In "Le Malade Imaginaire,"
Moliere points to the seeming vacuous circularity of the medical
knowledge of his time. Moliere's doctoral candidate explains the
ability of opium to put one to sleep by appealing solely to its "virtus
dormitiva," the latin phrase for "sleep-causing power."  Representation
is not used in this manner in cognitive science. One does not explain
object recognition solely by saying that the system has mental
representations. Nor does one respond to queries about the nature of
mental representation by saying that mental representation consists in
the power to recognize objects. One may hold the commitment that
cognitive systems have representations without holding either that only
cognitive systems represent, or that being had by a cognitive system is
sufficient for being a representation. One can in fact maintain the
separateness of being a representation from being had by a cognitive
system, even if one wants, as Fodor does, to draw a distinction between
mental and nonmental systems in terms of the types of representational
properties had by their respective states. DeWitt correctly warns
against lapsing into circularity in the absence of an adequate
definition of representation, but I think his worry that such a lapse
has already occurred is overstated.

1.  One popular approach to the naturalization of intentionality is to
equate the semantic properties of mental representations with the
information they carry, where the information they carry is unpacked in
terms of reliable causal covariance. Information-based approaches to
semantics, however, have a notorious problem in accounting for cases of
misrepresentation. If mental tokens represent their reliable causes,
then as long as such tokens are reliably caused they cannot be false.
Yet such false tokens are reliably caused all the time.

2.  Jerry Fodor (1987, 1990) has addressed the problem of
misrepresentation in informational semantics. He argues that an
examination of the counterfactual causal relations that surround the
tokening of mental states reveals a special kind of nomic dependency
that privileges certain of their causes over the rest. In particular,
there is a crucial asymmetry, he argues, between (what can be described
as) the `true' and `false' causes of a mental state token, since the
false causes of such a token are nomically dependent on the true causes
but not conversely. This asymmetry is demonstrated by the fact that
breaking the true-cause-to-mental-token link breaks the false link,
but breaking the false link does not break the true. Thus, Fodor's
suggestion is that while representation cannot be simply reduced to
information, it can be reduced to information-plus-asymmetric-dependence.

3.  Wallis (1993) argues that Fodor's account of representation gives
implausible results when applied to cases of misrepresentation in
transduction, feature detection and object recognition. In response, we
argue that the considerations Wallis brings to bear do not
undermine the substantive aspects of Fodor's account as such, but
merely suggest that it is in need of more complicated modification.

4.  Wallis's argumentative strategy is to begin with an interpretation
of the activity of neural states (cells or cell assemblies) inspired by
current information-processing theories in that domain. He then seeks
to demonstrate that Fodor's theory of representation is unable to
sustain this favoured interpretation because circumstances can be
contrived such that the interpretation fails to meet the criterion of
asymmetric dependence. We maintain, however, that what Wallis highlights
in these cases is that Fodor's condition of asymmetric dependence is
trivially false as it stands. There will always be a way of breaking
the false-cause-to-mental-token link which breaks the true-cause-to-
mental-token link. Apart from the utterly trivial ways (either
destroying the organism or breaking the false link by means of breaking
the true), one can, because true and false causal chains converge at
some point if they produce mental tokens of the same representational
type, break the false link anywhere after that point. If the first
point of convergence is the mental token itself, break the false link
by removing the capacity of the organism to have the mental token.
Similarly, there are always trivial ways to break the true link that
do not break the false one. Since true and false links diverge in their
causes at some point, screen the organism from true causes earlier than
that point. If the first point of convergence is reception/transduction
at or near the skin surface, modify the external environment so that no
true stimuli get through, but false stimuli do.

5.  Wallis's objections to Fodor in cases of transduction and object
recognition fall into these categories, we claim. Considering light
transducers (rods) which are also susceptible to heat, Wallis notes
that modifying the transducers (rhodopsin) to prevent false heat
stimuli from producing characteristic effects is just as apt to prevent true
photon stimuli doing the same as vice versa. He also notes the
symmetry between environmental modifications to screen true and false
stimuli respectively: each can be achieved independently of the other.
Considering colour receptors (cones): Wallis notes that colour-response
curves overlap, which permits phantom/false phenomena, but also ensures
that there is no physically possible way of changing the transduction
properties relative to one colour without doing the same for another
colour. Again, environmental modifications obviously will show the same
symmetries. Considering object recognition, Wallis notes that breaking
the barn-facsimile to barn-representation connection (by breaking the
internal causal chain at the rectangle-triangle-red-above to barn-
representation connection) also breaks the barn to barn-representation
connection. And externally, breaking the barn to barn-representation
connection by screening the organism from real barns does not
inevitably break the barn-facsimile to barn-representation link.

6.  The story is more complicated for the  case of edge detection. Edge
detectors are made of cells which work by decreasing response to angles
further from the given angle, or fade-out over a range rather than a
sharp spike at a single angle; but an edge detector might also be
identified as an assemblage big enough to have only the sharp spike
response. Wallis proposes that the spread of response in the former
case eliminates any possibility of asymmetry of Fodor's kind. Now what
is to count as false/phantom behaviour here? If the true angle is
identified as the peak response, a definite A degrees, then any
response of that module to a different angle counts as phantom. Here it
would seem that it would, at least in principle, be easier to find some
way to tune out a given phantom response than to find some way of
tuning out peak response without interfering with a given phantom
response (a promissory note, admittedly). If the true angle is rather a
preferred central range, then only responses from stimuli outside that
range count as phantom; but then there is also the problem of why one
should identify the latter as abnormal functioning. If, alternatively, an
edge detector is big enough to have a sharp response, then it has to be
shown that phantom phenomena do occur. Thus, Wallis's argument around
these points would seem to deserve an account of precisely what
abnormal response he is claiming symmetry for.

7.  But if Fodor's view is trivially false, one should consider the
possibility that it was merely expressed carelessly. Two obvious
modifications present themselves. First, to avoid the objections which
turn on linkage breaking in the external environment one simply rules
them out: only breakings of causal chains within the skin are to be
considered. After all, causal chains outside the skin threaten
asymmetry too easily, because it is too easy to break the true link by
appropriate screening without breaking the false link. Second, to avoid
the objections which turn on linkage breaking beyond the point of
commonality in the causal chains, one interprets Fodor as intending the
asymmetry to be as follows: the true link cannot be broken without
breaking the false link, but there are ways of breaking the false link
which do not break the true link. Then, the existence of ways of
breaking both is an insufficient objection.

8.  Needless to say, one must show that there are the appropriate
asymmetries. But at least for transduction and feature detection, this
is not so implausible. Interference with the mechanism in `normal'
operation of the sensory mechanism ought to throw the whole system off,
while arguably there are always some ways to get rid of false stimuli
without obstructing normal operations.

9.  The modifications proposed here do not overcome one of Wallis's
objections to Fodor's account in the case of object recognition: In the
language of possibilia, in any nearby possible world in which barn-
facsimiles fail to cause the tokening of barn-representations, real
barns would also fail to do so. Consequently, the counterfactuals fail
to elicit any asymmetry at this level. This problem with Fodor's
account has been highlighted by a number of authors (e.g.
Godfrey-Smith, 1989; Sterelny, 1990, Chp.6; Jones, Mulaire and Stich,
1991). Fodor's (1990) response is to go beyond pure informational
semantics to seek the necessary asymmetry in the causal history of
mental state tokens. That is, representation reduces to asymmetric
nomic-dependency-plus-actual-casual-history. Barn-facsimile-caused
barn-representations are false because they are historically
asymmetrically dependent on barn-caused barn-representations. This
provides the ontological depth that cannot be accounted for by causal
laws alone.

10.  Wallis is dismissive of this "line of retreat," but we find his
reasons unconvincing. It is surely unreasonable to require a perceptual
mechanism to display asymmetric behaviour with respect to a facsimile
barn. An object-recognizer ought to be positively fooled by such
cases. So if there is any asymmetric condition to separate the normal
operation of a barn recognizer from a barn-representation produced by a
facsimile barn, it will be causal-historical asymmetry. Moreover, much
of Wallis's disquiet at this point seems to be based on a
misunderstanding of the explanatory role of mental content in
computational cognitive science. He seems to suggest that any theory of
mental representation that implicates the causal history of mental
states is incompatible with a computational theory of object
recognition (e.g. Biederman, 1987). Now this incompatibility would only
exist if the content of a representational state played a direct causal
role in mental processes. But, according to computational cognitive
science at least, mental processes do not have access to the semantic
properties of the mental states over which they are defined. Hence the
role of mental content is indirect, but quite compatible with a theory
of representation that defers to causal history.

        *****CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT*****

LSE Centre for the Philosophy of the Natural and Social Sciences
CONFERENCE ON 'EVOLUTION AND THE HUMAN SCIENCES'
At the London School of Economics
Thursday 24 -- Saturday 26 June 1993
Co-organisers: Helena Cronin and John Worrall

CONFERENCE THEME: It is widely believed that the 'Darwinian
revolution' transformed our whole view of ourselves and of our place
in the universe. But, in fact, until recently the implications of Darwinian
theory for humans have remained remarkably underexplored. This is
partly because of the genuine problems facing Darwinian accounts of
human behaviour; and partly because the enterprise has been tainted by
an inglorious history, from the crude 'Social Darwinising' of the
nineteenth century onwards. But over the past couple of decades,
Darwinians have discovered rigorous and powerful principles of social
behaviour, and have applied them successfully to a wide variety of
animal species. Can this more sophisticated work lend insight into
*human* behaviour -- without repeating the mistakes of earlier false
starts? Recent studies -- in psychology, anthropology, economics,
sociology and linguistics -- suggest that it can. This conference will
bring together evolutionary biologists, social scientists, methodologists
and philosophers of science to appraise the prospects for carrying
through Darwin's unfinished revolution.

TOPICS: Evolutionary roots of homicide, incest, sexuality, reasoning,
language, consciousness, economics, medicine.

CONTRIBUTORS: Leda Cosmides; Martin Daly; Richard Dawkins;
Daniel C. Dennett; Robert H. Frank; David Haig; W. D. Hamilton;
David L. Hull; Nicholas Humphrey; Randolph M. Nesse; Steven Pinker;
Mark Ridley; Paul Romer; Elliott Sober; Dan Sperber; Donald Symons;
Nancy W. Thornhill; John Tooby; George C. Williams; Margo Wilson;
and others.

SYMPOSIA AND POSTERS: In addition to the main sessions involving
the listed contributors, there will be a series of Symposia and a Poster
display.

REGISTRATION: The conference fee of 75 pounds sterling (120 U.S.
dollars) includes lunches, teas, coffees and a reception. Numbers are
strictly limited and applications should be made before 30 April 1993.
Subject to places being available, applications will be accepted after this
date but there will be an additional fee of 15 pounds sterling for late
registration. Cheques should be made payable to the London School of
Economics. Cancellations will be accepted before 30 April 1993 but a
deduction of 25 pounds sterling will be made to cover administrative
costs. No refunds will be made after 30 April 1993.

    Reply to Van Brakel, Grush, and Morris on the Frame Problem

                James H. Fetzer
                Department of Philosophy
                University of Minnesota
                Duluth, MN 55812

1.0 Van Brakel (1993), Grush (1993), and Morris (1993) dispute the
analysis of the frame problem which is advanced in Fetzer (1991a) and
(1991b). There I suggest that the frame problem can best be understood
as a special case of the problem of induction, a problem that has
preoccupied philosophers at least since the time of David Hume. My
reason for thinking so stems from the realization that the frame
problem concerns our prospects for successful predictions about the
future on the basis of our past experience. Of course, there are other
aspects to the frame problem, including dimensions of representation
and of implementation, which I acknowledge, but at rock bottom there is
a profound similarity which (in my view, at least) justifies viewing
the frame problem as "a special case" of the problem of induction.

2.0 Somewhat to my surprise, this suggestion of mine, which I
considered to be sufficiently well-founded as to be almost beyond
serious debate, provoked a negative response, first from the editors
who were reviewing the proceedings of the Pensacola Conference for
possible inclusion in a book -- I have in mind Patrick Hayes
especially, but also another referee, who has remained anonymous, a
disagreement mediated by Ken Ford that culminated in the publication of
the exchange between us -- and now van Brakel and Grush, both of whom
reply to my prior remarks on van Brakel, and Morris, who like Hayes,
presumes that the frame problem is a matter of representation. What I
would like to do here, therefore, is to explain the reasons why the
frame problem may be viewed as a special case of the problem of
induction and to respond to the criticism of these commentators.

3.0 Let us assume that at least three interrelated issues are involved
here; these might be thought of as the problem of change, the problem
of representation, and the problem of implementation, respectively. The
problem of implementation can be solved if a suitable representation
can be designed and implemented in the form of a computer program. If
there were no suitable representation to implement in the form of a
computer program, however, it would be impossible to solve the problem
of implementation. Similarly, the problem of representation can be
solved if there is a suitable language (or representation scheme) for
representing solutions to the problem of change. If there were no
suitable solution to the problem of change, however, then (even given a
representation scheme) there would be nothing to represent.

4.0 A much simpler response to van Brakel (1992), therefore, might have
been to observe (as Hadley [1988], among others, has previously
observed) that while some computer scientists, such as Patrick Hayes,
want a narrow, technical definition of the frame problem, philosophers
tend to "include any problem whose solution is PRESUPPOSED by a
solution to the narrow problem" within its scope (Hadley 1988, p. 34;
original emphasis). Thus, if the problem of implementation cannot be
solved without solving the problem of representation, and if the
problem of representation cannot be solved without solving the problem
of change, then (as I see it) the frame problem has three dimensions in
the absence of solutions to which it cannot be solved, where the most
basic of the three (from a logical point of view) turns out to be the
problem of change.

5.0 In retrospect, I now believe that 4.0 above is most of what I
wanted to say about van Brakel (1992) and that I came across as
excessively provocative in Fetzer (1993a). The electronic media have
their distinctive strengths and weaknesses, as I observed in Fetzer
(1992a), and I appear to have succumbed to the temptation to say what I
had to say more forcefully than I ought to have said it. Nevertheless,
while I concede to excesses in the form of my presentation, I maintain
the content of my position. If there is a "family of frame problems"
that van Brakel (1992) identifies with [A] "Which things change and
which don't?", [B] "How can (solutions to) [A] be represented?", and
[C] "How can/do we reason about [A]?", this "family" seems to be close
enough to my "dimensions" for me to again affirm in 4.0 the views of
Fetzer (l993a).

6.0 Yet the position advanced by Hayes (1991), for example, might
possibly be based on the perception that the problem of representation
can be solved if we can design a suitable language (or representation
scheme) for representing solutions to the problem of change, whether or
not the problem of change itself is amenable to solution. A distinction
of this kind, I suppose, would enable Hayes to contend that the problem
of induction -- which I take to be the genus (or general problem) of
which the problem of change is a species (special case) -- is
"logically irrelevant" to the frame problem, when it is strictly
defined as a problem of representation in this fashion. This might make
sense of Hayes (1991), but it appears to be a "Pickwickian" pose to
adopt if there is no solution to the problem of change to represent.

7.0 I do not take van Brakel to be assuming a "Pickwickian" stance, and
he does acknowledge that the problem of induction has some relevance
here. He seems to think that by describing his [A], [B], and [C] as
"three dimensions" of the frame problem, I am thereby committing a
mistake, but apparently because NOTHING, including the frame problem,
can be precisely defined (van Brakel 1993). Insofar as I am maintaining
that the frame problem is SUBSUMED by the problem of induction, he
suggests, I have misrepresented their relations, because they are more
loosely connected. I would grant that the frame problem cannot be
COMPLETELY subsumed by the problem of induction, because it has the
representational and implementational aspects that are not elements of
the problem of induction, as that problem is traditionally understood.

8.0 The point of describing "the frame problem" as "a special case" of
the problem of induction, therefore, was to emphasize that the frame
problem cannot be solved without a solution to the problem of change,
which is the DIMENSION of the frame problem that is "a special case" of
the problem of induction (except when the frame problem is given the
"Pickwickian" twist described in 6.0). To this extent, I do not want to
contest van Brakel's denial that the problems are identical. But I do
want to insist that a COMPLETE SOLUTION to the frame problem (except in
its "Pickwickian" guise) presupposes an adequate solution to the
problem of induction. Thus, a solution to the problem of induction is
necessary (essential) to resolve the frame problem.

9.0 Nothing here, however, mitigates my skepticism about the
possibility of complete descriptions for concrete events as features of
the world's history. I take it that van Brakel and I agree on this
matter, which Hempel (1965), especially, has patiently explained, but
that we disagree on its significance. Thus, as Hempel emphasizes, we
can never completely describe, much less completely explain the
occurrence of any concrete event, which means that at best an event can
only be explained as an event under a description or perhaps as an
event of A SPECIFIC KIND (Hempel 1965, p. 233, for elaboration). I
would readily acknowledge that, if the explanation of any event
required an explanation for every property of that event, then
explanation would be impossible, since it is impossible to even
describe every property of any such occurrence.

10.0 At this juncture, we appear to part ways. Van Brakel construes me
as
thinking that the impossibility of complete descriptions can be
overcome by appealing to "a panacea like relevance or salience."
Insofar as I did not specifically contest this description in Fetzer
(1993a), van Brakel infers that I agree that appeals to MAXIMAL
SPECIFICITY and the like are "useless as a contribution to solving the
frame problem. The problem is just pushed ahead" (van Brakel 1993, Sec.
4). Strictly speaking, of course, I do not think that anyone can "break
out" of the problem of complete descriptions, which appears to be
impossible. What I think is that explanations for events as events of
specific kinds or under certain descriptions can be provided without
having to solve the unsolvable problem van Brakel cites.

11.0 As for relevance as a "panacea," I view the notion of RELEVANCE as
among the most basic of all concepts, but it is not therefore
unambiguous. In fact, a number of different conceptions must be
distinguished, which range from logical relevance to evidential
relevance to explanatory relevance, and a subset of explanatory
relevance conceptions that range from statistical to causal to nomic
relevance. The notion underlying these conceptions of explanatory
relevance, for example, is that a property F is explanatorily relevant
to the occurrence of an outcome E when the presence or absence of F
makes a difference to the occurrence of an outcome of that kind, where
making this precise is one of the objectives of the theory of
explanation as it has been pursued by Hempel (1965), Salmon (1971),
(1984), and Fetzer (1981), (1993b).

12.0 The theory of explanation that I propose depends on a conception
of laws of nature of which Hume would have disapproved. I maintain that
a distinction ought to be drawn between "permanent" and "transient"
properties, where permanent properties are contingent dispositions
something cannot lose without also losing a corresponding reference
property. Dispositions are envisioned, in turn, as single-case causal
tendencies that may be of universal or of probabilistic strength. These
conceptions provide an ontological foundation for fixing the truth
conditions of logically contingent subjunctive conditionals. Lawlike
sentences are true only if they are maximally specific and are
empirically testable by attempts to establish that they are false. I
have elaborated this account in some detail, most recently in Fetzer (1993b).

13.0 Van Brakel concedes the existence of laws of nature but believes
they "cannot be applied to concrete events without the addition of
unspecified ceteris paribus conditions." On this point, we are in
substantial disagreement. There are several approaches toward
understanding the nature of laws of nature and the structure of
scientific theories, some of which bear similarities to the position
that van Brakel endorses. It is my position that the success of
empirical science in discovering laws of nature depends upon there
being no more than a finite number of kinds of factors that make a
difference to the occurrence of any specific event. When there are more
than a finite number of factors or we cannot discover them, science
cannot succeed.

14.0 If van Brakel would like to address the problem of the nature of
laws of nature and the logic of scientific explanations, I would
welcome a debate within a more appropriate forum. For present purposes,
however, it would probably be more suitable for me to address briefly
the questions he poses about necessary and sufficient conditions for
events and concepts. There are various positions like van Brakel's,
some related to Wittgenstein, that hold that necessary and sufficient
conditions are never available for causes (because there are infinitely
many factors that influence the occurrence of an event, because ceteris
paribus conditions are always required, and so forth) or for concepts
(because their meaning is to be found in their use, because they are
only [at most] connected by family resemblance relations, and so on).

15.0 Van Brakel claims that I appeal to "some worn out positivistic
ideas if the 1930s," but I do not imagine that he has much familiarity
at all with my views on the problem of meaning (Fetzer 1990, esp. Part
I, 1991c, 1991d, 1991e or 1992b, for example). As for necessary and
sufficient conditions in the case of concepts, I presume that nominal
definitions, meaning analyses, and empirical analyses are amenable to
being understood in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, as
those are ordinarily understood, but that ostensive definitions,
explications, and contextual definitions are not. Insofar as the
situation with respect to events is closely related to Hayes's
position, I shall consider this next. But I would concede that the
matter of meaning is vastly more complex than was implied by my recent
comments on van Brakel.

16.0 Hayes wants to maintain a distinction between "common sense" and
"scientific knowledge" where the frame problem is a problem for common
sense that does not require scientific knowledge. If a strong
distinction were drawn between "common sense" and "scientific
knowledge," the frame problem could be be said to be the common-sense
version of the problem of induction and that would still be distinct,
which would trivially distinguish between them. I maintain that the
existence of "common sense" should not be taken for granted (Fetzer
1990, pp. 141-145), though I am less skeptical that there is something
called "ordinary knowledge" that differs from scientific knowledge more
in degree than in kind (Fetzer 1981, pp. xii-xiii). Here I simply want
to advance some examples that seem to illustrate some differences which
are at stake here:

18.0 It appears to be a matter of common sense to suppose that someone
who is stabbed through the heart will die. Yet there are conditions
under which people is stabbed through the heart will not die, for
example, when they are connected to a heart-lung machine while
undergoing heart surgery. It also appears to be a matter of common
sense to suppose that all people who take a large dose of a potent
poison will probably kill themselves and that people who take twice as
much will almost certainly kill themselves. Yet if one were to take a
large dose of an alkaline poison and another large dose of an acidic
poison, one would actually reduce rather than increase the probability
that of killing oneself. Other cases are not difficult to generate by
including or by excluding various causally relevant conditions.

19.0 It might be "common sense" to infer that one will die if stabbed
through the heart, but that is by no means always the case.
And it might be "common sense" to think that those who take twice
as much poison will increase their chances of killing themselves, but
that is not necessarily what happens. If we happen to be surgeons, we
may draw inferences that nonsurgeons would not draw. And if we happen to
be chemists, we may draw other inferences that nonchemists might not
draw. What qualifies as "common sense" can clearly differ from person
to person and from time to time as a function of factors such as age,
education, and general experiences in life. There is no specific set of
beliefs that qualifies as "common sense" that is common to the old and
the young, the educated and the ignorant, rich and poor alike.

20.0 If we are considering an appeal to "common sense" as a foundation
for solving the frame problem, we have to ask, "Common sense for whom?"
As soon as we recognize that the presence or the absence of causally
relevant factors makes a difference in each specific case, we ought to
consider the prospect of discovering the complete range of relevant
factors in the kind of cases that make a difference to us. If
empirical science is an attempt systematically to discover complete
sets of relevant conditions that make a difference in various domains
(such as physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth) then it should be
obvious that scientific knowledge might provide a more reliable
foundation for anticipating the course of experience than the highly
variable and incomplete knowledge that passes for "common sense" can
possibly provide.

21.0 The example of a match's lighting when it is struck in the
presence of oxygen, provided that it is not wet, is of appropriate
chemical composition, and struck with suitable force, was intended as
an illustration of contingently necessary and sufficient conditions,
where those conditions are individually necessary and jointly
sufficient in the case of specific events (tokens) as instances of
laws. Other illustrations are at hand of conditions that are
individually necessary or jointly sufficient in the case of generic
events (types) as instances of other laws. Animal life, for example,
cannot endure without food and water, which are necessary to those
forms of life. And for any system (including human beings) that wants
to lose weight (or mass), it is sufficient for that system to expend
more energy than it consumes.

22.0 Appeals to "common sense" may make no difference when the
consequences of making mistakes are not severe. But when the effects
would make a difference in our quality of life or its continuance
(whether in an individual case or in relation to the species), the
risks of relying upon "common sense" appear to outweigh the benefits.
Scientific knowledge, after all, promises to provide knowledge of the
kind that is required to enhance our prospects of success. In my response
to Hayes (1991), I accordingly provided a diagram representing the
relative preferability of programs based on scientific knowledge as
opposed to those based upon expert opinion as opposed to those based
on "common sense" (Fetzer 1991b). (Please note, however, that as
published in Ford and Hayes, eds. (1991), Figures 1 and 2 are
reversed.)

23.0 When Grush (1993) suggests that there may be "less disagreement
between van Brakel and Fetzer than Fetzer makes out, at least on these
issues," I am accordingly prepared to agree with him. I believe I was
overly confrontational and consequently exaggerated some differences
between us. Other differences remain, however, especially concerning
the nature of laws, the requirement of maximal specificity, and the
conditions that definitions must satisfy. Morris (1993), of course,
provides a review of the entire book, including a commentary on my
exchange with Hayes. In his view, my response to Hayes does little more
than restate the main themes of my original piece. I think that Morris
has not appreciated what I have said there, but one hopes that he will
find something of substance that merits further consideration here.
[Minor technical point: in Sec. 4.8, Morris mistakenly claims that
inferences involving "closed systems" (which satisfy maximally specific
descriptions) are "deductively valid," but that is the case only when
the laws of systems of those kinds happen to be universal rather than
probabilistic.]

24.0 Those who persist in maintaining that the frame problem is
exclusively a problem of representation (or a problem of
implementation), therefore, appear to miss the point, namely, that
without a solution to the problem of change, even the availability of a
representation scheme serves no suitable purpose, because there is no
solution to the problem of change to represent. And those who persist
in maintaining that the frame problem is one of "common sense" rather
than one of scientific knowledge need to understand that changes in the
world come about as a causal consequence of the operation of natural
laws, which are the objects of scientific discovery. Surely no useful
purpose can be served by restricting attention to "common sense" when
the resources that it provides are not adequate to the problem.

                   PSYCOLOQUY INSTRUCTIONS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 20,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral, cognitive, neural, social, etc.)
All contributions are refereed by members of PSYCOLOQUY's Editorial Board.

Target articles should normally not exceed 500 lines in length
(commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines). All target
articles must have (1) a short abstract (<100 words), (2) an indexable
title, (3) 6-8 indexable keywords, and the (4) author's full name and
institutional address. The submission should be accompanied by (5) a
rationale for soliciting commentary (e.g., why would commentary be
useful and of interest to the field? what kind of commentary do you
expect to elicit?) and (6) a list of potential commentators (with their
email addresses). Commentaries must have indexable titles and the
commentator's full name and institutional address (abstract is
optional). All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries
and responses (see format of already articles articles in PSYCOLOQUY).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

Please submit all material for publication to:
psyc@pucc.bitnet or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
             TWO WAYS TO ACCESS PSYCOLOQUY

 (1) To subscribe to PSYCOLOQUY on Bitnet send email to:
     listserv@pucc.bitnet or listserv@pucc.princeton.edu
     containing the following one-line message (without a message
     header or topic, i.e. leave "Subject" line blank):
sub psyc Firstname Lastname
     (substituting your first and last name, of course).
     (These instructions DO work, so please follow them faithfully! If
     for some reason you still do not succeed, send email to
     psyc@pucc.bitnet or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu and we will subscribe
     you by hand.)
     To unsubscribe, send (again to listserv@pucc.bitnet, NOT to
     psyc@pucc.bitnet, which is only for submissions) the message:
unsub psyc

 (2) PSYCOLOQUY can also be accessed on Usenet as the moderated newsgroup
     sci.psychology.digest but then you will regularly have to check
     Usenet for new issues, because they are not automatically emailed to
     you as they are in the Bitnet version (the Listserv access model is
     individual subscription, the Usenet access model is an institutional
     library). The Usenet edition is sent to your Institution's Usenet
     archive, and kept there for a few weeks. After that, it must be
     retrieved from the permanent PSYCOLOQUY archives in one of several
     possible ways, as described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     THREE(+) WAYS TO SEARCH AND RETRIEVE FROM THE PSYCOLOQUY ARCHIVES

     PSYCOLOQUY is now retrievable both by the standard listserv file
     retrieval commands on Bitnet and by anonymous ftp (plus some
     remarkable new tools) on the Internet:

 (1) Bitnet/Listserv Retrieval of PSYCOLOQUY Archive:
     Bitnet users can either send the commands shown below as a TELL message
     to Listserv (TELL LISTSERV AT PUCC) or as email to LISTSERV@PUCC.bitnet.
     If you use email, your commands should appear in the body of the
     message and not in the subject line. Remember to send your mail
     requests to LISTSERV@PUCC.bitnet, not to PSYC@PUCC.bitnet
     To get a list of all PSYC files:
GET PSYC FILELIST
     This will send you a file containing the names of all the available files.
     Then, to order an individual file:
GET fname ftype
     fname and ftype are the CMS Filename and Filetype as listed in the PSYC
     FILELIST file.

 (2) Internet/Unix/ftp Retrieval of PSYCOLOQUY Archive
     The PSYCOLOQUY archives are available by anonymous ftp,
     if you have it. To retrieve a file by ftp from a Unix/Internet site,
     type either:
ftp princeton.edu
     or
ftp 128.112.128.1
     When you are asked for your login, type:
anonymous
     Enter password as per instructions (make sure to include the specified @),
     and then change directories with:
cd /pub/harnad
     To show the available files, type:
ls
     Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example):
get psyc.92.3.15.consciousness.1.bridgeman
     When you have the file(s) you want, type:
quit
     In case of doubt or difficulty, consult your system manager.

 (3) Easier and more direct and powerful access to the PSYCOLOQUY
     archives is also available via archie, gopher, veronica and
     various wais servers, which do all the anonymous ftp search and
     retrieval for you and allow keyword and even full-text searching.
     Please ask your system administrator about these remarkable new
     electronic search and retrieval tools, or write to psyc@pucc.bitnet
     or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu for some general information about them
     (they are free, easy, and worth mastering, because they will be
     the primary means of accessing scholarly and scientific
     information in the near future).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Where the above procedures are not yet available (e.g. from Bitnet
   or some other networks), there are two fileservers:
   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and bitftp@pucc.bitnet
   that will do the ftp search and retrieval for you. To one or the
   other of them, send the following one line message:
help
   for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
   the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
   bitftp will then execute for you).

1. In the ongoing discussion of the "frame problem" (McCarthy 1963;
McCarthy & Hayes 1969; Hayes 1992) there has been a steady
proliferation of problems and problem-names (in a way that is itself
reminiscent of a frame problem!):

2. Van Brakel (1992, 1993) has listed a "family of frame problems,"
arising from the question of "[A] [w]hich things (facts, etc.) change
and which don't?", "[w]hat are the necessary and sufficient conditions
for an event[?]," "How can [A] be represented?", and "How can/do we
reason about [A]?" (van Brakel 1992: 1.1). The family then includes
"the persistence problem, temporal projection problem, inertia problem,
qualification problem, ramification problem, extended prediction
problem, installation problem, planning problem, holism problem,
relevance problem, and so on" (1.2). These in turn are "more or less
closely related to "the general problem of stating `laws of motion'
which adequately describe the world" [Ford & Hayes 1991 (F&H): p. x];
the prediction problem [Tenenberg's chapter in F&H: p. 232]; the
induction problem [Fetzer in F&H: p. 55]; "the general problem of
default reasoning" [Perlis: F&H p. 190]; "the larger, and uglier,
counterfactual validity problem" [Stein: F&H p. 225]; the "Frame
Problem" for natural language understanding, learning, and analogical
reasoning [Nutter: F&H p. 177]; and other problems." (1.4)

3. Hayes & Ford (1993: 2.4) go on to raise the ante still further with
"the inference problem... [and] the perception problem or the updating
problem" (and they could also have tossed in the the credit assignment
problem and the variable binding problem). They see many of these
problems as distinct. Van Brakel (1992: 2.2) instead suggests that
"[t]he frame problem is a special case of the problem of complete
description" [emphasis deleted] and Fetzer (1993a, b), that it is a
special case of the "problem of induction."

4. So there seem to be both ecumenical and hegemonic sentiments in the
air. For my part, I'd like to cast my vote for another unitary
candidate (if only in the hope of keeping problem numbers tractable),
one that might likewise subsume many of the rest as special cases.
It too has already been cited in this discussion, but I don't think it
was characterized quite accurately: "[H]ow can we ever attach `formal'
symbols to the actual world? This is what Harnad (1990) calls the
`symbol grounding problem'" (Hayes & Ford 1993: 4.2).

5. The symbol grounding problem is not just the problem of attaching
formal symbols to the world, for an UNGROUNDED symbol system (like
English or geometry) will serve that purpose admirably well (as long as
it has the right formal, syntactic properties). The way ungrounded
symbol systems manage to serve such purposes, however, is in being so
used by US. The symbols need not have any intrinsic meaning of their
own; they need only be systematically interpretable by us as meaning
what they mean, and then our own minds and actions can mediate the
connection between the symbols and what they can be interpreted as
being about.

6. This is perfectly fine as long as our goal is only to build systems
that are useful to us, for our minds can then always bridge the gap;
but if these systems are meant to be models of US -- i.e., of what's
going on in our heads, unmediated by what's going on in anyone else's
head -- then their symbols had better be GROUNDED directly in the
real-world objects, events, and states of affairs that they are
otherwise merely systematically interpretable (by us) as being about.

7. An ungrounded symbol system is essentially like a book (whether the
book is static, on paper pages, or dynamic, as in, say, a computerized
dictionary or encyclopedia). It's obvious that a sentence in a book
does not mean something in the sense that a thought in my head does.
The sentences in a book (and all their systematic inter-relations --
with other sentences in the book, with the language as a whole, and
with the truths and fictions about the real world) are merely strings
of arbitrary formal tokens that are systematically INTERPRETABLE as
being what they are about -- interpretable by thinkers like you and me,
whose thoughts, on pain of infinite regress, cannot themselves be
merely strings of arbitrary formal tokens that are systematically
interpretable... etc. That is the symbol grounding problem: The
connection between the symbols in a symbol system and what they are
interpretable as being ABOUT must be grounded in something other than
just the mediation of outside interpreters if they are to be candidates
for what is going on in our heads when we think.

8. My own candidate solution happens to be to try to ground a system's
internal symbols in its robotic capacity to discriminate, manipulate,
categorize, name, describe, and discourse coherently about the objects,
events and states of affairs that its symbols are systematically
interpretable as being about (at a human scale, indistinguishable from
the way we do it). In short, symbolic capacities are to be grounded in
robotic capacities. An ungrounded symbol system has only one set of
constraints: purely formal, syntactic ones, operating rulefully on the
arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens. A grounded symbol system would
have a second set constraints, bottom-up ones, causally influencing its
internal symbols and symbol combinations, constraints from the
internal, nonsymbolic machinery underlying its robotic capacities,
especially categorization (Harnad 1987, 1992; Harnad et al. 1991),
which is what would allow the system to pick out what its symbols are
about without the mediation of external interpretation.

9. Now what has all this to do with the frame problem? Formal systems do
very well in the world of formal, Platonic objects: An axiomatic system
can successfully "second-guess" all the truths of arithmetic (I hope no
one will cite Goedelian limits on provability as instances of the frame
problem!). Natural language seems to do almost equally well with the
world of real objects, events and states (especially since mathematics
and physics are subsets of natural language). In both cases, however, it
is clear that the symbol systems do not "speak for themselves" (except
perhaps for the mathematical formalist who claims that the only object
he is interested in is the uninterpreted formal system itself): They
are USED by us according to an interpretation that we HAVE IN MIND,
which itself is connected to what it is about through our bodies (in
particular, through our sensorimotor systems). There is no well-formed
sentence in natural language (including "colorless green ideas sleep
furiously") that we cannot "gloss," as long as all its terms are
grounded in thoughts that are about what the words are about.

10. What is a typical instance of the frame problem then? First, it
invariably involves an ungrounded symbol system onto which we have
hitherto successfully projected a systematic interpretation: we may
have attributed to it, for example, an understanding of a situation,
because it encodes sentences that are interpretable as our own
knowledge about the situation and it draws inferences, makes
predictions and performs operations on the situation that again square
systematically with our own. The frame problem arises when something
goes radically wrong: when the system does something that does not
square with our interpretations -- and not just in a minor way that can
be remedied by adding another piece of knowledge, just as we would remedy
any gap in our own knowledge, but a major incoherence, something that
destabilizes our entire systematic interpretation. One often repeated
example is that the system, which seems to "know" so much about what's
going on in a room, may, to our surprise, behave as if it "believed"
that everything in the room ceases to exist when one leaves the room,
a circumstance with which it does not happen to have been challenged
before, when we were confirming its conformity with our systematic
interpretations.

11. The problem is described as calling for a means of framing what is
and is not altered by a change, but it is clear that the "change" is
not especially one that is caused by an "action," like leaving the
room, but, in principle, by any new data. At any point, a symbol system
has only dealt with a small amount of data (relative to human scale
performance). That's why such systems are often called "toy" systems.
Toy performance, relative to human-scale performance, is highly
UNDERdetermined (just as a specific billiard shot is underdetermined
relative to all possible two-body interactions:  many theoretical
interpretations of that shot are possible, but much fewer are possible
for the set of all physically possible two-body interactions). Yet in
projecting a systematic (usually natural-language) interpretation onto
such a toy, one is at the same time OVERinterpreting it (typically
overinterpreting it mentalistically, in terms of what it "know,"
"thinks," "means"). And, in my view, a "frame" problem arises every
time we run up against evidence that we have exceeded the limits of
that underdetermined toy; evidence that we are overinterpreting it --
and have been all along.

12. The optimistic solution to "scaling up" is that more and more of the
same -- more and more ungrounded sentences, pushing the frame's limits
wider and wider -- will eventually shrink the remaining "frame
problems" to only those that we, the interpreters, are also prone to.
So we will either not notice them or cease to regard them as evidence
that there is something wrong with this kind of model in the first
place.

13. I am more pessimistic. I think the reason the frame problem keeps
rearing its head is because there is something intrinsically wrong with
an ungrounded symbolic approach to modeling the mind (if not to
building useful tools for systems with minds). I do not think knowledge
can be "framed" with symbols alone, be they ever so encyclopedic. I
think nothing less than the real world of objects, events and states of
affairs that the symbols aspire to be about is needed, not to "frame"
the symbols, but to ground them -- in the robotic capacities that we
life-size human beings so clearly have.

        Workshop  on  Logic  Programming  With  Incomplete  Information




The  aim  of  the  one  day  workshop  is  to  bring  together  researchers
working  on  different  aspects  of  representing  (and/or  reasoning
with)  incomplete  information  in  the  frame  work  of  logic
programming  and  databases.    The  workshop  will  be  held  in
conjunction  with  the  International  Logic  Programming  Symposium
(ILPS'93),  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada,  October  26  to
October  29,  1993.    The  workshop  will  be  held  after  the
conference.

The  format  of  the  workshop  will  be  in  the  form  of  short
presentations  and  discussions  on  completed  work  and  work  in
progress.    We  also  expect  the  workshop  to  be  informal,  providing
a  forum  for  close  interactions  between  participants.
Presentations  and  discussions  are  invited  on  any  topic  relevant
to  logic  programming  with  incomplete  information,  including  but
not  limited  to  extensions  of  logic  programming  by  disjunction,
null  values,  classical  (strong)  negation,  abduction  etc.    as
well  as  the  use  of  logic  programs  (and  their  extensions)  for
representing  incomplete  knowledge  in  specific  domains.

If  you  are  interested  in  giving  a  presentation  of  your  current
research  at  the  workshop,  please  send  an  extended  abstract
(about  6  pages)  by  August  10,  1993,  to  the  address  given  below.
Notification  of  acceptance  will  be  given  by  September  30,  1993,

		 FORMAL IMAGINATION

     A Special Issue of Fundamenta Informaticae

	     Guest Edited by Don Perlis
	       University of Maryland

=========================================================

 Imagination may be an odd thing to think of  as  formal
 or computational, except to those working in the allied
 computational cognitive sciences!

 Yet to the extent that  imagination  is  the  creation,
 determination,  representation,  elaboration,  and  use
 of alternative  views  (whether  as  possibilities  for
 --or different  from--a  presumed  present reality), it
 is at least implicit in  many "intelligent"  behaviors.
 The aim of this Special Issue is to make more  explicit
 this role, and to record progress on such to date.  The
 underlying theme is that effective reasoning depends on
 a rich source of ideas to be  entertained  as  part  of
 their eventual acceptance, rejection, reformulation, or
 indexical or contextual qualification.

 Papers describing formal attempts to model alternative
 or novel situations, or  computational  techniques for
 the same, are especially welcomed.  This  can  include
 general treatments--e.g., circumscribed,  default,  or
 sanctioned possibilities, views, contexts, situations,
 conjectures, contradictions, inexistents, appearances;
 and also  those  applied  to specific domains  such as
 discovery,  intentions  in  utterances,  temporal  and
 hypothetical   alternatives,  semantic  shifts (as  in
 metaphor), avoiding past errors, extending beliefs  to
 new  settings, and  theories  of reasoned alternatives
 in humans. However, the focus should be on  a  special
 treatment for an agent's own computing,  representing,
 or using of alternatives or extensions  to  what  that
 same agent believes is actually the case.

========================================================
    Papers should arrive to the editor  no later than
    October 1, 1993, at the address below. Electronic
    submission  is  encouraged (vanilla  LaTeX  only, 
    please). Papers  will  be  refereed  anonymously.
    Acceptance/rejection  notices  will  be  sent  by
    email no later than November 20, 1993.

    The editor would appreciate knowing in advance of
    intentions to submit  papers.  Also,  suggestions
    for additional contributors would be appreciated.

    PLEASE SEND ALL QUERIES OR OTHER REPLIES DIRECTLY
    TO  PERLIS (perlis@cs.umd.edu) AND  *NOT*  TO THE
    ENTIRE ADDRESSEE LIST (i.e., NOT to spp@umiacs).

   another is merely new: what's the difference? And how is creativity
   possible? -- These questions about human creativity can be answered, at
   least in outline, using computational concepts.
   
   There are two broad types of creativity, improbabilist and
   impossibilist. Improbabilist creativity involves (positively valued)
   novel combinations of familiar ideas. A deeper type involves METCS: the
   mapping, exploration, and transformation of conceptual spaces. It is
   impossibilist, in that ideas may be generated which -- with respect to
   the particular conceptual space concerned -- could not have been
   generated before. (They are made possible by some transformation of the
   space.) The more clearly conceptual spaces can be defined, the better
   we can identify creative ideas. Defining conceptual spaces is done by
   musicologists, literary critics, and historians of art and science.
   Humanist studies, rich in intuitive subtleties, can be complemented by
   the comparative rigour of a computational approach.
   
   Computational modelling can help to define a space, and to show how it
   may be mapped, explored, and transformed. Impossibilist creativity can
   be thought of in "classical" AI-terms, whereas connectionism
   illuminates improbabilist creativity. Most AI-models of creativity can
   only explore spaces, not transform them, because they have no
   self-reflexive maps enabling them to change their own rules. A few,
   however, can do so.
   
   A scientific understanding of creativity does not destroy our wonder at
   it, nor make creative ideas predictable. Demystification does not imply
   dehumanization.

"Artificial Life: a Bridge towards a New Artificial Intelligence"

Palacio de Miramar (San Sebastian, Spain)
December 10th and 11th, 1993

Workshop organised by the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science,
Faculty of Computer Science & Institute of Logic, Cognition, Language
and Information (ILCLI) of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)

Directors: Alvaro Moreno (University of the Basque Country)
           Francisco Varela (CREA, Paris)

This Workshop will be dedicated to a discussion of the impact of works
on Artifical Life in Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has traditionally attempted to study cognition as an abstract
phenomenon using formal tools, that is, as a disembodied process that
can be grasped through formal operations, independent of the nature of
the system that displays it. Cognition appears as an abstract
representation of reality. After several decades of research in this
direction the field has encountered several problems that have taken it
to what many consider a "dead end": difficulties in understanding
autonomous and situated agencies, in relating behaviour in a real
environment, in studying the nature and evolution of perception, in
finding a pragmatic approach to explain the operation of most cognitive
capacities such as natural language, context dependent action, etc.

Artificial Life (AL) has recently emerged as a confluence of very
different fields trying to study different kinds of phenomena of living
systems using computers as a modelling tool, and, at last, trying to
artificially (re)produce a living or a population of living systems in
real or computational media. Examples of such phenomena are prebiotic
systems and their evolution, growth and development, self-reproduction,
adaptation to an environment, evolution of ecosystems and natural
selection, formation of sensory-motor loops, autonomous robots. Thus,
AL is having an impact on classic life sciences but also on the
conceptual foundations of AI and new methodological ideas to Cognitive
Science.

The aim of this Workshop is to focus on the last two points and to
evaluate the influence of the methodology and concepts appearing in AL
for the development of a new ideas about cognition that could
eventually give birth to a new Artificial Intelligence. Some of the
sessions consist on presentations and replies on a specific subject by
invited speakers while others will be debates open to all participants
in the workshop.

ABSTRACT: Both Artificial Life and Artificial Mind are branches of what
Dennett has called "reverse engineering": Ordinary engineering attempts
to build systems to meet certain functional specifications; reverse
bioengineering attempts to understand how systems that have already
been built by the Blind Watchmaker work. Computational modelling
(virtual life) can capture the formal principles of life, perhaps
predict and explain it completely, but it can no more BE alive than a
virtual forest fire can be hot. In itself, a computational model is
just an ungrounded symbol system; no matter how closely it matches the
properties of what is being modelled, it matches them only formally,
with the mediation of an interpretation. Synthetic life is not open to
this objection, but it is still an open question how close a functional
equivalence is needed in order to capture life. Close enough to fool
the Blind Watchmaker is probably close enough, but would that require
molecular indistinguishability, and if so, do we really need to go that far?

        KEYWORDS: learning; memory; consciousness; explicit/implicit
                  processes; rules; instances; unconscious processes

        ABSTRACT: The proposal that there exist independent explicit
        and implicit learning systems is based on two further
        distinctions: (i) learning that takes place with versus without
        concurrent awareness, and (ii) learning that involves the
        encoding of instances (or fragments) versus the induction of
        abstract rules or hypotheses. Implicit learning is assumed to
        involve unconscious rule learning. We examine the implicit
        learning evidence from subliminal learning, conditioning,
        artificial grammar learning, instrumental learning, and
        reaction times in sequence learning. Unconscious learning has
        not been satisfactorily established in any of these areas. The
        assumption that learning in some of these tasks (e.g.,
        artificial grammar learning) is predominantly based on rule
        abstraction is questionable. When subjects cannot report the
        "implicitly learned" rules that govern stimulus selection, this
        is often because their knowledge consists of instances or
        fragments of the training stimuli rather than rules. In contrast
        to the distinction between conscious and unconscious learning,
        the distinction between instance and rule learning is a sound
        and meaningful way of taxonomizing human learning. We discuss
        various computational models of these two forms of learning.

    Jonathan J. Koehler: THE BASE RATE FALLACY MYTH

    Qualified professional cognitive and biobehavioral scientists are
    hereby invited to submit Open Peer Commentary on the target article
    that appears below. Instructions for PSYCOLOQUY commentators follow
    the text.

TARGET ARTICLE AUTHOR'S RATIONALE FOR SOLICITING COMMENTARY:

Academics of all stripes have concerned themselves, at one point or
another, with base rate questions. How do I and others use background
information to make inferences, judgments and predictions? What is the
best way to use this information? This target article  challenges the
accepted wisdom that people do a poor job integrating informative base
rates into their decision processes. It also presents a new approach to
the study of base rate phenomena that can lead to prescriptive
recommendations. Input from philosophers, sociologists of science,
psychologists and others is needed to assess the merits of the
arguments presented, and the wisdom of doing away with the existing
research agenda. Commentary from a broad spectrum of scholars is also
needed to provide insight into the conditions that promote and preserve
oversimplification and overgeneralization in scientific research
environments. Commentary that draws parallels with related phenomena or
that examines the application of base rate reasoning in particular
domains will also be helpful. For example, legal scholars can provide a
unique perspective on the wisdom and legality of base rate arguments in
court, while medical ethicists can identify some pressing issues for
the new ecologically sensitive research program.

    0.0. ABSTRACT: We have been oversold on the base rate fallacy in
    probabilistic judgment. First, few tasks map unambiguously into the
    simple, narrow framework that is held up as the standard of good
    decision making. Second, the literature does not support the widely
    held belief that people ignore base rates. Third, we know very
    little about how the ambiguous, unreliable and unstable base rates
    of the real world are and should be used by decision makers who
    have complex performance goals. It is suggested that the existing
    research paradigm be replaced by an empirical program that examines
    real world base rate usage and embraces more flexible standards of
    acceptable performance.

    0.0. KEYWORDS: Base rate fallacy, Bayes' theorem, decision making,
    ecological validity, ethics, fallacy, judgment, probability.

1.0. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Psychologists, particularly behavioral decision theorists,
routinely use Bayes' theorem as a normative model for aggregating
base rates [see ENDNOTE #1] with other probabilistic information
(Fischhoff & Beyth-Marom, 1983; Meehl & Rosen, 1955; Slovic &
Lichtenstein, 1971; von Winterfeldt & Edwards, 1986) [see ENDNOTE #2].
While an increased attention to base rates and Bayesian methods will
sometimes improve predictive accuracy, there is no single, clear
normative standard for using base rate information in most realistic
decision situations. This is not because Bayesian methods lead to
unresolvable paradoxes (Jonakait, 1983) or are logically flawed
(Brilmayer & Kornhauser, 1978; Bergman and Moore, 1991), as some have
intimated. Instead, it is because base rates do not map into the
Bayesian framework in most real world problems.

1.2. The failure to appreciate this point has led to a vast oversale of
the so-called "base rate fallacy" in the probabilistic judgment
literature. According to this fallacy, people routinely ignore base
rates and it is an error to do so. The normative portion of the fallacy
is widely regarded as a self-evident implication of Bayes' Theorem. In
most experiments, base rates are equated with prior probabilities, and
deviations between subjects' judgments and the Bayesian posterior
probability are used to measure the extent to which the base rate
fallacy has been committed. The descriptive portion of the fallacy, it
is said, has been demonstrated so often that one commentator has
concluded that "The genuineness, the robustness, and the generality of
the base-rate fallacy are matters of established fact" (Bar-Hillel,
1980, p. 215; see also Bar-Hillel, 1983; Borgida & Brekke, 1981).

1.3. The present target article offers a different perspective on the
base rate fallacy. It is contended that both the normative and the
descriptive components of the base rate fallacy have been exaggerated.
Indeed, it is far from clear that people misuse base rates in any
important contexts.

1.4. At the normative level, we must bear in mind that there is an
important difference between identifying a theoretically sound
normative rule for aggregating probabilistic information of a certain
sort (i.e., prior odds and likelihood ratios) and fairly applying that
rule to a broad class of base rate tasks. Applicability of the rule
depends critically on how well the task or, more precisely, the
decision maker's representation of the task, meets the assumptions of
the rule. Where key assumptions are violated or unchecked, the
superiority of the normative rule reduces to an untested empirical
claim. No studies have addressed this issue.

1.5. At the empirical level, there is little to support widely repeated
claims that people ignore base rates (see e.g., Christensen-Szalanski &
Bushyhead, 1981, p. 931; Evans & Bradshaw, 1986, p. 16; Ginossar &
Trope, 1987, p. 464; Nisbett & Borgida, 1975, p. 935; Pollard & Evans,
1983, p. 124). A fair review of the literature -- i.e., one that does
not start and end with the 1970s "classics" -- suggests that base rates
almost always do influence judgments, and that their influence is often
quite substantial.

2.0. QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS

2.1. Should people make greater use of base rates than they presently
do? The answer is far from clear. Part of the reason for the
uncertainty is that the ecological validity of the base rate literature
is low. Subjects are asked hypothetical questions about unfamiliar and
unrealistic situations. They are presented with a single base rate that
they are expected to treat as perfectly reliable. Failure to do so is
recorded as an error. But such "errors" tell us little about whether
people should make greater use of base rates in the kinds of situations
they confront in their daily lives.

2.2. A second reason we can't say whether people should make greater
use of base rates is that researchers have not given the normative
component of the base rate fallacy the attention it deserves. Too
often, base rate researchers make simplifying assumptions to invoke a
normative standard, but at costs that deny the appropriateness or
generality of their analyses. Consider the following assumptions:

2.2.1. "Subjects' prior beliefs are precisely represented by the single
base rate statistic provided by the experimenter": This assumption
allows researchers to use Bayes' theorem to determine whether their
subjects rely on base rates (i.e., priors) to an appropriate extent.
But why must a base rate be equated with a subject's prior belief?
Subjects' prior beliefs may be informed by base rates, but the two need
not be identical. One will almost always have additional information
that does, and by all rights should, affect one's prior beliefs. Even
under conditions where it is hard to imagine what such additional
information might be, a study showed that 36% of subjects held priors
that differed from supplied base rates (Beyth-Marom and Fischhoff,
1983, exp. 5).

2.2.2. "The context within which base rate problems are presented and
solved does not and should not influence their solutions": Studies by
Schwarz, Strack, Hilton, & Naderer (1991), however, have shown that
subjects pay close attention to conversational norms when trying to
solve base-rate/Bayesian problems. Schwarz et al. (1991) reported that
people relied more on individuating information when the instructions
defined the task as a psychological problem rather than as a
statistical problem. Subjects apparently used the psychological context
of the problem as a cue that the forthcoming individuating information
would be relevant and diagnostic. It is interesting to note that
subjects who attached additional weight to the individuating
information in the psychology context might be regarded as good
Bayesians: their predictions were based on all available information,
including information derived from previous experience with similar
contexts.

2.2.3. "Subjects understand and accept that the individuating
information in base rate problems is a random sample from an
unambiguous reference class": In the paradigmatic lawyer-engineer
problem subjects are told that the personality descriptions of 5 people
were chosen at random from a pool of lawyers and engineers. The
descriptions were not randomly selected, however, and some subjects
may have suspected as much once they were exposed to their
stereotypical content. When Gigerenzer, Hell, & Blank (1988; experiment
1) ran a version of the lawyer-engineer problem in which subjects
performed and observed the random sampling for themselves, the
influence of base rates was much stronger than it was when random
sampling was only verbally asserted. Similarly, reassurances about the
representativeness of base rates in causal attribution studies promoted
greater use of these data (Hansen & Donoghue, 1977; Wells & Harvey, 1977).

2.2.4. "Subjects' prior beliefs are and should be made independently of
their assessments of the diagnostic strength of individuating
information." Birnbaum (1983) pointed out that it is usually
unrealistic to assume that likelihood ratios are independent of either
base rates or prior probabilities. Birnbaum reviewed empirical
investigations in the signal detection literature which show that, for
human witnesses, the ratio of the hit rate to the false alarm rate
(i.e., the likelihood ratio) depends on signal probabilities (i.e.,
base rates). That is, the accuracy of likelihood information derived
from observer reports changes as the observer's knowledge of the base
rates changes. Illustrating his point with frequent references to the
taxi cab problem [see ENDNOTE #3], Birnbaum explained that a witness
who is aware that there are many more Green cabs than Blue cabs is
probably predisposed to see Green cabs in ambiguous situations. In
light of this dependence, the actual probability that a cab in an
accident was Blue given that a witness says so may be much closer to
the median and modal responses given by untrained subjects (80%) than
to the solution presented by base rate investigators (41%). Indeed,
Birnbaum showed that one normatively appropriate response for witnesses
who are aware of the 85% base rate for Green cabs and who wish to
minimize errors is 82%.

2.5 In short, mechanical applications of Bayes' theorem will not help
us measure a "base rate fallacy" when key assumptions of the model are
either unchecked or grossly violated, or when features of the task and
task environment that may appropriately influence subjects' responses
are ignored.

3.0. BASE RATES ARE NOT IGNORED

3.1. It is frequently claimed that people ignore base rates and that
the literature supports this conclusion. This claim is a considerable
exaggeration at best. Although many studies have concluded that base
rates are accorded relatively less weight than individuating,
case-specific information in particular situations, few have shown that
base rates are ignored.

3.2. Some of the confusion may be attributable to the unfortunate use
of the term "ignore" by some investigators to describe data which
suggested only that subjects attach relatively less weight to base
rates than to descriptive, individuating information. In their classic
lawyer-engineer experiment, Kahneman and Tversky (1973) reported a
small but statistically significant main effect for the base rate
(p < .01). Nevertheless, this study is widely cited as a convincing
demonstration that base rates are "ignored" (e.g., Fagley, 1988;
Nisbett & Borgida, 1975). But even if one regards small base rate
effects as evidence that base rates are ignored, additional work on the
lawyer-engineer problem suggests that the conclusions others have drawn
from this study should be viewed with caution.

3.3. There have been numerous attempts to replicate the Kahneman and
Tversky (1973) lawyer-engineer results. Table 1 presents the posterior
probability estimates given by subjects in seven lawyer-engineer
experiments that were conducted and reported in a comparable manner.
These experiments were identical or nearly identical to Kahneman &
Tversky's (1973) experiment and examined the impact of both diagnostic
and nondiagnostic individuating information [see ENDNOTE #4]. If we
set aside the difficulties of interpreting base rate study data for the
time being, the top panel of Table 1 suggests that base rates uniformly
influence subjects' judgments in the presence of diagnostic
individuating information. Differences between high and low base rate
groups ranged from 2% to 30%, with an average near 10%.

    and 7. Gigerenzer, Hell & Blank (1988).

    Note 3: Fischhoff and Bar-Hillel (1984) used 10 diagnostic and 10
    nondiagnostic "profiles." Due to limited space, only the results
    of the profiles that were identical to those used by Kahneman and
    Tversky (1973) are reproduced in Table 1. The results for the
    profiles used in Ginossar and Trope (1987) and in Gigerenzer et
    al. (1988) are listed separately. The results for the remaining
    studies are averaged across profiles as reported in the original
    studies.

3.4. The bottom panel of Table 1 does not present a consistent picture
regarding whether or how base rates influenced judgments in the
presence of nondiagnostic individuating information. In Kahneman and
Tversky (1973) and Gigerenzer et al. (1988), judgments for high and low
base rate groups were virtually indistinguishable, suggesting that base
rates had little impact on final judgments. However, the remaining four
studies revealed strong base rate effects. Indeed, a doctoral
dissertation by Hamilton (1984) concluded that subjects in the
nondiagnostic individuating information conditions based their
judgments exclusively on the base rates provided.

3.5. This set of data from the lawyer-engineer problem does not provide
strong support for the conclusion that base rates are universally
ignored or even "largely ignored" (Kahneman and Tversky, 1973, p.
242). Data from other types of base rate studies contradict this
conclusion as well. For example, it has been shown that base rates
influence social judgments (Hewstone et al., 1988; Manis, Dovalina,
Avis, & Cardoze, 1980; Rasinski, Crocker & Hastie, 1985), personality
judgments (Iennarella & Kaplan, 1988), moral judgments (McGraw, 1987),
auditing judgments (Hackenbrack, Nelson, & Amer, 1992), medical
judgments (Weber, Bockenholt, Hilton and Wallace, in press), sports
judgments (Gigerenzer et al., 1988), among others. These results are
not surprising. A moment's reflection suggests that base rates are
commonly used in daily life, even when other sources of information are
available. Baseball managers routinely "play the percentages" by
choosing left-handed batters to face right-handed pitchers and vice
versa; police officers stop and detain suspected criminals, in part, on
the basis of background characteristics; voters mistrust the political
promises of even their most favored politicians. In each instance, base
rate probabilities are considered and given substantial -- if not
determinative -- weight.

4.0. EMERGENCE OF THE MYTH

4.1. So how did the base rate neglect myth emerge and sustain itself in
the academic literature? Two explanations come to mind. The first
relies on a Kuhnian account of scientific belief; the second is a
heuristic explanation. Kuhn (1962/1970) is well-known for his views about
the nature of scientific progress and paradigm shift. Kuhn stressed
that a simple and powerful theory can withstand empirical challenge
when the challenging data are not accompanied by a simple, general
theory of their own. The base rate neglect thesis sprang from the
heuristics and biases paradigm that dominated research on judgment and
decision making in the 1970s and 1980s. This paradigm, developed
largely by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, was extremely critical of
people's intuitive judgments about probabilistic events, claiming that
people make such judgments via simple error-prone heuristics. One
well-known heuristic, representativeness, suggests that people's
judgments about the probability of category membership depend on how
similar the features of the target are to the essential features of the
category (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972). Thus, judgments that Viki is an
accountant depend upon how similar Viki's interests, background,
talents, etc., are to those ordinarily associated with accountants.

4.2. As evidence in support of this heuristic mounted, base rate
neglect became an easy sell. If people use the representativeness
heuristic, and if base rates are typically less representative of a
category's central features than individuating information, then it
follows that people will ignore base rates. Empirical support for this
phenomenon soon appeared (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973) and the "base rate
fallacy" (Bar-Hillel, 1980) became a favorite instantiation of the
heuristics and biases paradigm. When subsequent research failed to
support the theory, the data were ignored and the theory persisted; the
underlying principle was too attractive to abandon on account of data.
The result was a simplification and misinterpretation of the body of
literature by observers, researchers and reviewers alike.

4.3. Ironically, psychologists' misperception of the base rate
literature may also be attributed to heuristic thinking. In order to
make sense of a morass of complex and sometimes conflicting data,
scientists may search for (or create) simple conclusions to represent a
given body of research. The consequences of such simplification are
potentially large. In a recent paper on the misrepresentation of
behaviorism, Todd and Morris (1992) document this phenomenon and note
that simple and general statements about a literature can become more
authoritative than either the existing data or the claims made about
the data by the original authors. The construction and acceptance of
the Hawthorne effect similarly illustrates the point. Although a series
of studies at the Hawthorne electrical plant that began in the late
1920s are widely cited in authoritative texts and reviews as
demonstrating that workers' productivity increased regardless of the
type of change made in their work environments, this interpretation is
a gross simplification and distortion of the actual findings (for
sociological analyses, see Adair, 1984; Gillespie, 1991; Jones, 1992).

5.0. TOWARD AN ECOLOGICALLY VALID RESEARCH PROGRAM

5.1. If we are to increase our understanding of how people should and
do use base rates, an ecologically sound program of research is
required. The current research paradigm, which relies heavily on the
use of controlled stimuli and artificial task environments, says too
little about the use of the imperfectly reliable base rates that the
natural ecology presents. In the end, it may matter little how much
attention people pay to base rates in problems of the lawyer-engineer
type. In the real world, those who appreciate the unreliability of
certain types of base rates may make better decisions than those who do
not. If we are serious about wanting to help decision makers make the
best possible use of base rates, the next generation of studies must
examine base rate usage in more realistic decision problems and
environments.

5.2. Such a research program might begin by speculating about when
judgmental accuracy is and is not likely to be impaired by a relative
inattention to base rates. Inattention to base rates would seem likely
to impede accuracy when the base rates conflict with other sources of
information and are high in relative diagnosticity. In medical
diagnoses, for example, inattention to reliable low base rates could
lead to extensive overdiagnosis and excessive treatment. Consider that
the general base rate for hypothyroidism is less than 1 in 1000 among
young adult males (De Keyser & Van Herle, 1985), although the primary
symptoms of this disease -- dermatological problems, depression, and
fatigue -- are quite common. A diagnostician who disregards the base
rate and relies solely on the individuating symptomatology and
resultant likelihood ratios will surely overdiagnose this disease.

5.3. There may be a class of situations in which a relative inattention
to base rates will not impede judgmental accuracy. Specifically, where
there is a good deal of redundant information, a relative inattention
to or underweighting of base rates may not matter. Most real world
situations are rich with information. Furthermore, unlike most problems
that appear in the existing base rate literature, base rates often do
not run contrary to the bulk of other sources of information. For
example, suppose you know that the summer evening jazz festivals in
the city are usually very crowded; perhaps the base rate for a very
large crowd is 80%. It is unlikely that subsequently received
information relevant to an estimate of crowd size will contradict this
base rate. Traffic in the immediate vicinity of the festival will
probably be heavy, not light; more police officers will be assigned to
this area rather than fewer; the lines at nearby restaurants will
probably be longer, not shorter. In cases such as this, where much of the
available information is consistent, failure to incorporate base rates
is unlikely to hinder predictive accuracy.

6.0. CONCERNS OTHER THAN ACCURACY

6.1. Although decision makers are generally motivated to make accurate
judgments, there are many situations in which accuracy is not the only
basis for evaluating performance. For example, the American legal
system is greatly concerned with a variety of fairness and due process
issues, some of which interfere with judgmental accuracy (Nesson, 1985;
Tribe, 1971). Indeed, certain types of highly probative evidence are
routinely excluded in court (e.g., illegally obtained confessions)
because their admission undermines other judicial values. It is often
argued that admitting base rates violates the legal norm of
individualized justice and should therefore be excluded as well [see
ENDNOTE #5].

6.2. In other cases, cost of error considerations may persuade decision
makers to make judgments that they believe are inaccurate. The American
legal system requires that criminal guilt be proved "beyond a
reasonable doubt." This subjective standard is designed to minimize
erroneous convictions. A cost of this systemic value is that juries
will often return "not guilty" verdicts in cases where they believe the
defendant is guilty (albeit not beyond a reasonable doubt).

6.3. The point is that judgments about the performance of real world
decision makers will often need to take factors other than judgmental
accuracy into account. Moreover, even where accuracy is the primary
goal, prescriptive recommendations might also take into account such
costs as the time, mental effort, and money that may be required to
improve accuracy. This means that we will need to relax our notion of
what constitutes an appropriate response in base rate problems given to
us in the natural ecology (cf. Bar-Hillel, 1983). Many problems will
have multiple solutions. Indeed, whenever the assumptions, goals and
values of decision makers vary, people exposed to identical information
may arrive at different solutions, none of which are necessarily
erroneous.

6.4. An empirical research program that embraces person- and
situation-specific performance criteria can provide richer insights and
more useful prescriptive recommendations than the existing research
program. In time, we may determine when people ought to pay more or
less attention to the imperfect base rates of the natural ecology in
order to best achieve their goals. At this time, prescriptive
guidelines should be developed and marketed to the relevant decision
making communities.

ENDNOTES

    #1. A base rate may be defined as the relative frequency with which
    an event occurs or an attribute is present in a population
    (Ginossar & Trope, 1987; Hinsz, Tindale, Nagao, Davis, & Robertson,
    1988; Lanning, 1987). Hence the base rate for six-figure annual
    incomes might be 95% among Major League Baseball players in the
    United States, but less than 1% among professional guitar players.

    #2. Bayes' theorem follows directly from the multiplicative rule
    of probability which holds that the joint probability of two events,
    H and E, equals the product of the conditional probability of one of
    the events given the second event, plus the probability of the
    second event. In mathematical notation:
    P(H&E) = P(H|E)P(E)
    P(H&E) = P(E|H)P(H)
    Therefore: P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H) / P(E)
    where P(E) = P(E|H)P(H)+P(E|-H)P(-H) for binary hypotheses.

    Odds form:
    P(H|E) / P(-H|E) = [P(E|H)P(H) / P(E)] / [P(E|-H)P(-H) / P(E)] =
    P(E|H)P(H) / P(E|-H)P(-H) = [P(H) / P(-H)] X [P(E|H) / P(E|-H)]

    The letters H and E stand for Hypothesis and Evidence respectively.
    P(H) and P(-H) refer to the probabilities of the truth and falsity
    of a hypothesis H prior to the collection of additional evidence.
    P(H) and P(-H) are "prior probabilities" and their ratio is the
    "prior odds." P(E|H) and P(E|-H) represent the information value of
    the evidence if the hypothesis is true and false respectively;
    their ratio is the "likelihood ratio." P(H|E) and P(-H|E) are the
    probability that the hypothesis is true and false in light of the
    evidence; their ratio is the "posterior odds," which represents the
    combination of the prior odds and likelihood ratio.

    #3. The taxi cab problem, as described by Tversky and Kahneman
    (1980, p. 62) is as follows: "A cab was involved in a hit-and-run
    accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue,
    operate in the city. You are given the following data: (i) 85% of
    the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue. (ii) A witness
    identified the cab as a Blue cab. The court tested his ability to
    identify cabs under the appropriate visibility conditions. When
    presented with a sample of cabs (half of which were Blue and half
    of which were Green) the witness made correct identifications in
    80% of the cases and erred in 20% of the cases. Question: What is
    the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue
    rather than Green?"

    #4. Other lawyer-engineer studies not described in Table 1 for
    reasons of noncomparability include Borgida and Nisbett (1977),
    Davidson and Hirtle (1990), Gabrenya and Arkin (1979), and Schwarz,
    Strack, Hilton, and Naderer (1991).

    #5. Debate about what role base rates and other types of
    probabilistic evidence should play in court has raged for years.

    Fairley, 1970; Kaye, 1979, 1981; Koehler, 1992, 1993; Koehler &

        INSTRUCTIONS FOR PSYCOLOQUY AUTHORS AND COMMENTATORS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 20,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral, cognitive, neural, social, etc.)
All contributions are refereed by members of PSYCOLOQUY's Editorial Board.

Target article length should normally not exceed 500 lines [c. 4500 words].
Commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines [c. 1800 words].

All target articles, commentaries and responses must have (1) a short
abstract (up to 100 words for target articles, shorter for commentaries
and responses), (2) an indexable title, (3) the authors' full name(s)
and institutional address(es).

In addition, for target articles only: (4) 6-8 indexable keywords,
(5) a separate statement of the authors' rationale for soliciting
commentary (e.g., why would commentary be useful and of interest to the
field? what kind of commentary do you expect to elicit?) and
(6) a list of potential commentators (with their email addresses).

All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries and
responses (see format of already published articles in the PSYCOLOQUY
archive; line length should be < 80 characters, no hyphenation).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

Please submit all material to psyc@pucc.bitnet or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu

  ARTIFICIAL LIFE: A BRIDGE TOWARDS A NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
        Palacio de Miramar (San Sebastian, Spain)
             December 10th and 11th, 1993

Workshop organised by the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science,
Faculty of Computer Science & Institute of Logic, Cognition, Language
and Information (ILCLI) of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)

Directors: Alvaro Moreno (University of the Basque Country)
           Francisco Varela (CREA, Paris)

This Workshop will be devoted to a discussion of the impact of work
on Artifical Life on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has traditionally attempted to study cognition as an abstract
phenomenon using formal tools, that is, as a disembodied process that
can be grasped through formal operations, independent of the nature of
the system that displays it. Cognition is treated as an abstract
representation of reality. After several decades of research in this
direction the field has encountered several problems that have taken it
to what many consider a "dead end": difficulties in understanding
autonomous and situated agencies, in relating to behaviour in a real
environment, in studying the nature and evolution of perception, in
finding a practical explanation for the operation of most cognitive
capacities such as natural language, context dependent action, etc.

Artificial Life (AL) has recently emerged as a confluence of very
different fields trying to study different kinds of features of living
systems using computers as a modelling tool, and, at last, trying to
artificially (re)produce a living system (or a population of them) in
real or computational media. Examples of such phenomena are prebiotic
systems and their evolution, growth and development, self-reproduction,
adaptation to an environment, evolution of ecosystems and natural
selection, formation of sensory-motor loops, autonomous robots. Thus,
AL is having an impact on classic life sciences but also on the
conceptual foundations of AI and new methodological ideas in Cognitive
Science.

The aim of this Workshop is to focus on the last two points and to
evaluate the influence of the methodology and concepts appearing in AL
for the development of new ideas about cognition that could
eventually give birth to a new Artificial Intelligence. Some of the
sessions consist of presentations and replies on a specific subject by
invited speakers while others will be debates open to all participants
in the workshop.

MAIN TOPICS:
* A review of the problems of FUNCTIONALISM in Cognitive Science
  and Artificial Life.
* Modelling Neural Networks through Genetic Algorithms.
* Autonomy and Robotics.
* Consequences of the crisis of the representational models of cognition.
* Minimal Living System and Minimal Cognitive System
* Artificial Life systems as problem solvers
* Emergence and evolution in artificial systems

ABSTRACT: Both Artificial Life and Artificial Mind are branches of what
Dennett has called "reverse engineering": Ordinary engineering attempts
to build systems to meet certain functional specifications; reverse
bioengineering attempts to understand how systems that have already
been built by the Blind Watchmaker work. Computational modelling
(virtual life) can capture the formal principles of life, perhaps
predict and explain it completely, but it can no more BE alive than a
virtual forest fire can be hot. In itself, a computational model is
just an ungrounded symbol system; no matter how closely it matches the
properties of what is being modelled, it matches them only formally,
with the mediation of an interpretation. Synthetic life is not open to
this objection, but it is still an open question how close a functional
equivalence is needed in order to capture life. Close enough to fool
the Blind Watchmaker is probably close enough, but would that require
molecular indistinguishability, and if so, do we really need to go that far?

ABSTRACT: We discuss the mothodological foundations for our work on the
development of cognitive architectures, on control systems, for
situated autonomous agents. We focus on the problems of developing
sensory-motor ystems for mobile robots, but we also discuss the
applicability of aur approach to the study of biological systems. We
argue that, for agents required to exhibit sophisticated ionteractions
with their environments, complex sensory-motor processing is necessary,
and the design by hand of control systems capable of this is likely to
to become a prohibiytively difficult as complexity increases. We
propose an automatic design process involving artificial
evolution,where the basoc buildig blocks used for evolving cognitive
architectures are noise-tolerant dynamical networks. These networks may
be recurrent, and should operate in real time.  time. The evolution
should be incremental, using an extended and modified version of a
genetic algorithm. Practical constraints suggest that initial
architecture evaluations should be done largely in simulation. To
support our claims and proposals, we summarize results from some
preliminary simulation experiments where visually guided robots are
evolved to operate in simple environments. Significantly, our results
demonstrate that robust visually-guided control systems evolve from
evaluation fuctions which do not explicitly require monitoring visual
input. We outline the difficulties involved in continuing with
simulations, and conclude by describing specialized visuo-robotic
equipment, designed to eliminate sensors and actuators.

ABSTRACT: I reconsider the status of computationalism (or, in a weak
sense, functionalism): the claim that being a realisation of some (as
yet unespecified) class of abstract machine is both necessary ans
sufficient for having genuine, full-blooded, mentality. This doctrine
is now quite widely (though by no means universally) seen as
discredited. My position is that, thoug it is undoubtedly an
unsatisfactory (perhaps even repugnant) thsis, the arguments against it
are still rather weak. In particular, I critically reassess John Searle's
infamous Chinise Room Argument, and also some relevant aspects of
Karl Popper s theory of the Open Universe. I conclude that the status
of computationalism must still be regarded as undecided' and that it
may still provide a satisfactory framework for research.

ABSTRACT: Genetic algorithms are methods of parallel search for optimal
solutions to tasks which are inspired by biological evolution and are
based on selective reproductiomn and the addition of variiation through
mutations or crossover. As models of real biological and behevioral
phenomena, however, genetic algorithms suffer from many limitations.
Some of these limitations are discussed under the rubrics of (a)
environment, (b) variation, and (c) fitness, and ways are suggested to
overcome them. Various simulations using genetic algoritms and neural
networks are briefly described which incorporate a more biologically
realistic notion of evolution.

ABSTRACT: Traditianally autonomous systems research has been a domain
of Artificial Intelligence. We argue that, as a consequence, it has
been heavily influenced, often tacitly, by folk psychological notions.
We believe that much of the widely acknowledged failure of this
research to produce reliable and robust artificial autonomous systems
can be apportioned to its use and dependence upon forlk psychological
constructs. As an alternative we propose taking seriously the
Eliminativce Materialism of Paul Chuchland In this paper we present our
reasons for adopting this radical alternative approach and briefly
describe the bottom-up methodology that goes with it. We illustrate the
discussion with examples form our work on autonomous systems.

    Roland Puccetti: DENNETT ON THE SPLIT-BRAIN

    The qualified professional readership of PSYCOLOQUY is hereby
    invited to submit Open Peer Commentary on the target article that
    appears below. Instructions for submission follow the article.

TARGET ARTICLE AUTHOR'S RATIONALE FOR SOLICITING COMMENTARY:

The standard interpretation of split-brain patients is that they have
double consciousness. Dennett rejects this interpretation in support of
his "multiple drafts" model of consciousness. Important problems with
this alternative interpretation are pointed out here. Psychologists,
neuropsychologists, neurologists, cognitive scientists and
philosophers are invited to comment.

    ABSTRACT: In "Consciousness Explained," Dennett (1991) denies that
    split-brain humans have double consciousness: he describes the
    experiments as "anecdotal." In attempting to replace the Cartesian
    "Theatre of the Mind" with his own "Multiple Drafts" view of
    consciousness, Dennett rejects the notion of the mind as a
    countable thing in favour of its being a mere "abstraction." His
    criticisms of the standard interpretation of the split-brain data
    are analyzed here and each is found to be open to objections. There
    exist people who have survived left ["dominant"] cerebral
    hemispherectomy; by Dennett's criteria, they would not have minds.

    KEYWORDS: cartesianism, cell death, cerebral dominance,
    consciousness, hemispherectomy, lateralization, mental duality,
    mental unity, multiple drafts, split brain.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. In his already influential book, Consciousness Explained (1991),
Daniel Dennett disputes the claim that split-brain patients exhibit
double consciousness. We get an intimation of his view early on in
the book, where he describes the rationale for the surgery and how
split-brain subjects recover some functions despite permanent damage to
the nerve circuits involved:

    A particularly suggestive anecdote comes from the research with
    split-brain patients (Gazzaniga, 1978) [sic: Dennett must mean
    Gazzaniga and Ledoux, 1978]. The left and right hemispheres are
    normally connected by a broad range of fibres called the corpus
    callosum. When this is surgically severed [for the treatment of
    epilepsy], the two hemispheres lose their major direct 'wires' of
    interconnection, and are practically incommunicado. If such a
    patient is asked to identify an object -- such as a pencil -- by
    reaching inside a bag and feeling it, success depends on which hand
    does the reaching. Most of the wiring in the body is arranged
    contralaterally, with the left hemisphere getting its information
    from -- and controlling -- the right side of the body, and
    vice-versa. Since the left hemisphere normally controls language,
    when the patient reaches in the bag with his right hand, he can
    readily say what is in the bag, but if the left hand does the
    reaching, only the right hemisphere gets the information that the
    object is a pencil, and is powerless to direct the voice to express
    this. But occasionally, it seems, a right hemisphere will hit upon
    a clever stratagem; by finding the point of a pencil, and digging
    it into his palm, he causes a sharp pain to be sent up the left
    arm, and some pain fibres are ipsilaterally wired. The left,
    language-controlling hemisphere gets a clue: it is something sharp
    enough to cause a pain. 'It's sharp -- it's perhaps a pen? a
    pencil?' the right hemisphere, overhearing this vocalization, may
    help it along with some hints -- frowning for pen, smiling for
    pencil -- so that by a brief bout of 'Twenty Questions' the left
    hemisphere is led to the correct answer (p. 198).

2. Since this kind of elaborate cross-cuing of the speaking left
hemisphere by the mute right one is well known in the literature, it is
surprising to read Dennett's sceptical remarks on it immediately
following:

    There are more than a few anecdotes about such ingenious jury-rigs
    invented on the spot by patients with split brains, but we should
    treat them with caution. They might be what they appear to be:
    cases exhibiting the deftness with which the brain can discover and
    implement autostimulatory strategies to improve its internal
    communications in the absence of the 'desired' wiring. But they
    might also be the unwittingly embroidered fantasies of researchers
    hoping for just such evidence. That's the trouble with anecdotes
    (ibid).

3. Why does Dennett say this? Perhaps because there being two centers
of consciousness in split-brain patients would be problematic for his
own theory, which denies that there is a "Cartesian Theater of the
Mind" in which perceptions jointly come together to consciousness
[forming a single mind]; rather, such perceptions consist of "Multiple
Drafts" occurring throughout the whole brain [better, the entire
cerebral cortex]. If the mind is only an abstraction derived from these
multiple drafts, then it is not based in anything readily countable
[one or two or however many], such as cerebral hemispheres. Hence the
effects of cerebral commissurotomy, revealing a potential duality of
mind in the normal intact human brain, need to be discounted.

4. But theoretical motivation is not yet demonstration by force of
argument. It is only much later in Dennett's book that he attempts
this, launching three lines of attack in just two pages of text. I turn
to these arguments now.

II. FIRST ARGUMENT

5. Dennett claims that a right hemisphere-based center of
consciousness [in a right-handed split-brain patient] exists as such
only transitorily after the surgery:

    For brief periods during carefully devised experimental procedures,
    a few of these patients bifurcate in their response to a
    predicament, temporarily creating a second center of narrative
    gravity [Dennett's term for the self]. A few effects of the
    bifurcation may linger on in mutually inaccessible memory traces,
    but aside from these actually quite primitive traces of the
    bifurcation, the life of a second rudimentary self lasts a few
    minutes at most, not much time to accrue the sort of autobiography
    of which fully fledged selves are made (p. 425).

6. This is is a rather nonstandard interpretation of the split-brain
evidence. Dennett seems to be confusing the time it takes to
demonstrate the cognitive independence of the disconnected right
hemisphere under testing conditions with the postsurgical span of
consciousness of that hemisphere. The logic seems analogous to that of
the following hypothetical conversation:

    YOU:      Does Puccetti speak French?
    DENNETT:  A little.
    YOU:      That's funny. I thought he got his doctorate from the Sorbonne.
    DENNETT:  Well, I heard him arguing with the waiter in a Parisian cafe
              once, but that lasted only a few minutes.

III. SECOND ARGUMENT

7. Dennett quotes approvingly the following argument (adapted from
Ronald De Sousa, 1976), which he takes to support his own view that it
is the distinctness of different "narratives" which accounts for there
being distinct selves:

    When Dr. Jekyll changes into Mr. Hyde, that is a strange a
    mysterious thing. Are they two people taking turns in a single
    body? But here is something stranger: Dr. Juggle and Mr. Boggle
    [standing for the left and right cerebral hemispheres of a single
    body] too, take turns in one body. But they are as like as
    identical twins! Why then say that they have changed into one
    another? Well, why not: if Dr. Jekyll can change into a man as
    different as Hyde, surely it must be all the easier for Juggle to
    change into Boggle, who is exactly like him. We need conflict or
    strong difference to shake our natural assumption that to one body
    there corresponds at most one agent (ibid).

8. Note first that, on the surface of things, this second (adopted)
argument conflicts with Dennett's first argument. For in the first he
contended that the disconnected right hemisphere has only a transitory
consciousness. If that were so, and its consciousness were identical
with that of the left hemisphere, then its consciousness would be
equally transitory. But in fact we already know that the consciousness
of the two hemispheres is profoundly nonidentical (from Dennett's own
description of a typical split-brain experiment, given above). For only
the left, speaking hemisphere can name the object being palpated out of
sight in a bag by the left hand; the mute right hemisphere knows what
it is, but cannot name it, because it can't talk. And as for De Sousa's
[and presumably Dennett's] demand for conflict or strong difference in
behavior emanating from the disconnected cerebral hemispheres, there
are indeed cases of intermanual conflict in the split-brain literature
(Gazzaniga, 1970; Bogen, 1985).

IV. THIRD ARGUMENT

9. Dennett asks what it is like to be a right-hemisphere-based self
in a split brain patient:

    This is the most natural question in the world, and it conjures up
    a mind-boggling -- and chilling -- image: there you are, trapped
    in the right hemisphere of a body whose left side you know
    intimately (and still control) and whose right side is now as
    remote as the body of a passing stranger. You would like to tell
    the world what it is like to be you, but you can't! You're cut off
    from all verbal communication by the loss of your indirect phone
    lines to the radio station in the left hemisphere. You do your best
    to signal your existence to the outside world, tugging your half of
    the face into lopsided frowns and smiles, and occasionally (if you
    are a virtuoso right hemisphere self) scrawling a word or two with
    your left hand (pp.  425-426).

10. This is supposed to show, one infers, that there is something
dreadfully amiss with the split-brain literature. But in fact there
seems to be some misinterpretation on Dennett's part here. For example,
if Dennett is a right-hander, it is his left hemisphere asking
left-hemisphere readers to imagine being trapped in a disconnected
right hemisphere. None of us left-hemisphere-based speakers and readers
can do that, for we do not share the right hemisphere's typical
life-long mutism. How could a disconnected right hemisphere possibly
want to tell the world what it is like to be him or her, since a center
of consciousness based there would not have a prior conception of what
it is like to tell anyone anything? Dennett's misconception here is
based on the assumption that split-brain surgery necessarily implies
splitting a single self into two. Many followers of the split-brain
literature do indeed make that assumption, but it needs independent
argument, something Dennett does not supply.

11. There is an implication also in this passage that prior to the
surgery the right hemisphere used its left cerebral companion to effect
verbal communication. This is almost certainly incorrect, because adult
left hemispherectomy to halt tumour invasion reveals the residual right
hemisphere's verbal repertoire limited to simple epithets like "Shit!"
and "Goddammit!" (Smith, 1966).

12. The parody of right-hemisphere alienation and helplessness
following surgical disconnection provided by Dennett in the passage
quoted is also strikingly contradicted by the apparently cheerful and
persistent cross-cuing Dennett himself described earlier (e.g., by
causing the face to frown at an incorrect left hemisphere verbal
response, or to smile at a correct one). Why does the right
hemisphere-based center of consciousness do this, especially in view of
the left hemisphere's explicit denial, under direct questioning by the
examiner, that another center of consciousness in the same head even
exists (Levy, 1989)? In a game of charades where you are the silent
partner, would you continue to cooperate if your verbose partner
announced that you were a mere robot?

13. The explanation for this may lie in the observation that if
lifelong mutism is characteristic of the right hemisphere, then it has
been aware from a tender age of the mental duality because, since long
before the surgery, it has been aware that it is not doing the talking
and reading and writing that emanates from its own body.

V. DENNETT'S CONCLUSION

14. Despite potential problems of the kind I have described, Dennett
seems confident that he has demolished the standard view of cerebral
commissurotomy, namely, that it creates two minds in place of the
single mind that was based in the brain before:

    This exercise of imagination could go on in the obvious ways, but
    we know it is a fantasy -- as much a fantasy as Beatrix Potter's
    charming stories of Peter Rabbit and his anthropomorphic animal
    friends. Not because 'consciousness is only in the left hemisphere'
    and not because it couldn't be the case that someone found himself
    or herself in such a pickle, but simply because it isn't the case
    that commissurotomy leaves in its wake organizations both distinct
    and robust enough to support such a separate self (p. 426).

15. To this strong dismissal of the standard view, Dennett adds:

    It could hardly be a challenge to my theory of the self that it is
    'logically possible' that there is such a right hemisphere self in
    a split-brain patient, for my theory says that there isn't, and
    says why: the conditions for accumulating the sort of narrative
    richness [and independence] that constitutes a 'fully fledged' self
    are not present. My theory is similarly impervious to the claim --
    which I would not dream of denying -- that there could be talking
    bunny rabbits, spiders who write English messages in their webs,
    and for that matter melancholy choo-choo trains. There could be, I
    suppose, but there aren't -- so my theory doesn't have to explain
    them (ibid).

16. Thus, for Dennett, "narrative richness" is not merely
characteristic of human selves, it is a necessary condition of coming
to constitute a self. But if that were so then it would not just be the
disconnected right hemisphere of the split-brain patient that would not
qualify for selfhood. Let me bring this out by contrasting two very
different syndromes of brain damage and their behavioral sequelae.

VI. LEFT HEMISPHERECTOMY AND NEOCORTICAL DEATH

17. Surgical excision of the left cerebral hemisphere in adults
[usually to prevent the spread of a malignant tumour] has the typical
effect of provoking profound aphasia in the patient. This is hardly a
surprising outcome, since the left hemisphere is almost always dominant
for both speech and handedness. In other words, the healthy residual
right hemisphere is, to say the least, language-poor (Smith, 1966).
Call this syndrome LH for short.

18. The situation for patients succumbing to neocortical death without
brain stem death is very different indeed. This can be caused by a
temporary deprivation of oxygen and glucose to the brain, as in a
near-drowning accident, so that within minutes the gray matter
[neocortex] of the brain is destroyed, while the relatively hardy
neurons making up the brain stem are spared. As a consequence, the
patient can breathe spontaneously and does not need to be placed on a
respirator. The bodies of such patients can then be kept alive
indefinitely under intensive care. Call this syndrome ND for short.

19. With the gray matter gone, however, no one survives ND to appreciate
this care, for the neocortex subserves conscious functions, and without
it personal life ends [at least in this life, to avoid begging
religious questions]. In a state of permanent coma, the ND patient is
beyond both help and harm, so it can be argued that "breathing corpses"
should be declared dead and the breathing stopped to prepare them for
burial (Puccetti, 1988).

20. Now if Dennett were right about "narrative richness" being a
necessary condition for constituting a human self, the LH patient is no
better off than the ND patient. One could argue on this basis that the
former should be disposed of too: there is "no one home" in either
case. But this conclusion is grossly counterintuitive. Suppose the ND
patient receives a visit from a loved one, say his granddaughter. He
lies there supinely, breathing away, but nothing the granddaughter does
or can do ever gets through to his conscious self, since there is none
left.

21. Suppose now, by contrast, the LH patient receives a visit from her
grandson. She is seated in a wheelchair. She cannot talk [though she
may say "Hello" and give the grandson's name]. She understands only
simple language. She is paralysed on the right side of her body and
face. But she positively beams during the visit, delighted with photos
of family members, the house and pets. And she may even reach out with
her left hand to stroke her grandson's arm.

22. Who could possibly recommend medical disposal of the LH patient on
a par with the ND patient? [Of course Dennett would not, either: he
just hasn't thought through these implications of his own analysis.]
There is, however, a lesson to be learned from this. New theories of
mind are welcome, but they must not be allowed to override relevant
behavioral evidence. Otherwise philosophy becomes a dangerous
undertaking.

        INSTRUCTIONS FOR PSYCOLOQUY AUTHORS AND COMMENTATORS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 35,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral, cognitive, neural, social, etc.)
All contributions are refereed by members of PSYCOLOQUY's Editorial Board.

Target article length should normally not exceed 500 lines [c. 4500 words].
Commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines [c. 1800 words].

All target articles, commentaries and responses must have (1) a short
abstract (up to 100 words for target articles, shorter for commentaries
and responses), (2) an indexable title, (3) the authors' full name(s)
and institutional address(es).

In addition, for target articles only: (4) 6-8 indexable keywords,
(5) a separate statement of the authors' rationale for soliciting
commentary (e.g., why would commentary be useful and of interest to the
field? what kind of commentary do you expect to elicit?) and
(6) a list of potential commentators (with their email addresses).

All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries and
responses (see format of already published articles in the PSYCOLOQUY
archive; line length should be < 80 characters, no hyphenation).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

TR-1. Alan Prince. In Defense of the Number i: Anatomy of a Linear
Dynamical Model of Linguistic Generalizations.  $6.30.
     The Goldsmith-Larson dynamical linear network model of stress
and syllable structure is solved in closed form, and its principal
properties are determined analytically; the first section of the
report gives a qualitative summary and linguistic evaluation of the
results.

TR-2. Alan Prince & Paul Smolensky. Optimality Theory: Constraint
Interaction in Generative Grammar. $11.00.
     A grammar is a system of ranked, violable constraints on output
representations. The constraints are universal; a grammar is given by
a ranking of the universal constraint set. Issues in syllabic, prosodic,
and segmental phonology are addressed.

TR-3. John McCarthy & Alan Prince. Prosodic Morphology I:
Constraint Interaction and Satisfaction. $9.50.
     Prosodic effects on morphology emerge under Optimality Theory
when phonological constraints are ranked above morphological
constraints. Reduplication and associated phenomena in Axininca
Campa are analyzed exhaustively from this perspective, and a
general characterization of Prosodic Morphology is developed.

TR-4. Jane Grimshaw. Minimal Projection, Heads, and Optimality.
$3.00.
     Complex patterns of verb placement and complementizer
distribution follow from the interaction of four very general
principles (e.g. `heads must be filled at s-structure', `functional
projections must be functionally interpreted'), ranked under
Optimality Theory.

TR-5. Stephen Stich & Ian Ravenscroft. What *is* Folk Psychology?
$2.20.
     When a variety of different interpretations of `folk
psychology' are properly distinguished, certain interpretations of
the standard arguments for eliminative materialism are undermined.

TR-6. Jacob Feldman. Perceptual Categories and World Regularities.
$9.50.
     TR-6 presents a formal theory of inductive categorization
construed as a computational perceptual problem; and a series of
experiments on human perceptual categorization that support the
theory.

TR-7. John McCarthy & Alan Prince. Generalized Alignment. $3.60.  
     Structural relations between grammatical categories (here,
morphological and phonological) are governed by a single family of
constraints under Optimality Theory: these demand that one type of
grammatical constituent share a designated edge with some other type
of constituent. Evidence is considered from footing patterns,
infixability, epenthesis, syllabification, and prosodic
subcategorization.

TR-8. Zenon Pylyshyn. Some Primitive Mechanisms underlying Spatial
Attention. $2.30.
     TR-8 describes a research program investigating a theory of
preattentive visual location indexing, with 4 different lines of
psychophyical experimentation.

TR-9. Stephen Stich & Stephen Laurence. Intentionality & Naturalism. 
$2.20.
     Although the project of `naturalizing' intentional  properties
has been a central concern in recent philosophy of mind, nothing
worrisome follows if it should turn out that intentional properties
cannot be naturalized.  

TR-10. Alan Leslie. Pretending and Believing: Issues in the theory
of ToMM. $2.80.
     The normal capacity to acquire a commonsense ``theory of
mind'' depends upon a specialized, domain-specific cognitive
mechanism.

TR-11. Stephen Stich & Shaun Nichols. Second Thoughts on
Simulation.  $2.70.
     This paper distinguishes several different ways in which
people might use off-line simulation in predicting and explaining
each other's behavior, and argues that some of these strategies
probably are used, while others are not.

TR-12. Alan Leslie. A Theory of Agency.  $2.70.
     Our core notions of Agency reflect three different processing
mechanisms arranged hierarchically; succeeding mechanisms interpret
Agents' behavior at succeeding levels of representation -- the
mechanical, the actional, and the cognitive -- where each level
corresponds to a different subtheory of agency.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. This volume grew out of a workshop on implications of the cognitive
sciences for the philosophy of science held in October, 1989 under the
sponsorship of the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science. The idea
behind the workshop was that the cognitive sciences have reached a
sufficient state of maturity that they can now provide a valuable
resource for philosophers of science who are developing general
theories of science as a human activity. The hope is that the cognitive
sciences might come to play the sort of role that formal logic played
for Logical Empiricism or that history of science played for the
historical school within the philosophy of science. This development
might permit the philosophy of science as a whole finally to move
beyond the division between "logical" and "historical" approaches that
has characterized the field since the 1960s.

2. The unifying label, "cognitive science," in fact covers a diversity of
disciplines and activities. For the purposes of this volume, I
distinguish three disciplinary clusters: (i) Artificial Intelligence
(itself a branch of computer science), (ii) Cognitive Psychology, and
(iii) Cognitive Neuroscience. These clusters tend to be thought of as
providing three different levels of analysis, with the functional units
becoming more abstract as one moves "up" from neuroscience to
artificial intelligence. Each of these disciplinary clusters provides a
group of models that might be deployed in approaching problems that are
central to the philosophy of science. I begin with cognitive psychology
because it seems to me that the models being developed in cognitive
psychology are, at least for the moment, the most useful for a
cognitive approach to the philosophy of science.

II. MODELS FROM COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY

3. Nancy Nersessian provides a prototype of someone drawing on research in
the cognitive sciences to solve problems in the philosophy of science.
The focus of her research is a problem originating in the historical
critique of Logical Empiricism. Logical Empiricism made science
cumulative at the observational level while allowing the possibility of
change at the theoretical level. But any noncumulative changes at the
theoretical level could only be discontinuous. The historical critics
argued that science has not been cumulative even at the empirical
level. But some of these critics, such as Kuhn and Feyerabend, also
ended up with a view of theoretical change as being discontinuous,
though for different reasons. Thus was born the problem of
"incommensurability." Nersessian's project is to dissolve the problem
of incommensurability by showing how the theoretical development of
science can be continuous without science as a whole being cumulative.

4. Most historically minded critics of Logical Empiricism took over the
assumption that scientific theories are primarily LINGUISTIC
entities. The main exception is Kuhn, who gave priority to concrete
exemplars over linguistically formulated generalizations. Nersessian
adopts a theory of "mental models" as elaborated, for example, by
Johnson-Laird (1983). On this approach, language, in the form of
propositions, may be used not to describe the world directly, but to
construct a "mental model," which is a "structural analog" of a
real-world or imagined situation. Once constructed, the mental model
may yield "images," which are mental models viewed from a particular
perspective. This interplay of propositions, models, and images
provides a richer account of the representational resources of
scientists than that used by either Logical Empiricists or most of
their critics. It may be thought of as an extension of the
model-theoretic approach to the nature of scientific theories as
elaborated, for example, by Suppe (1989), van Fraassen (1980, 1989),
and myself (Giere, 1988). In any case, the cognitive theory of mental
models provides the main resource for Nersessian's account of the
dynamics of conceptual change in science. Some such account of
representation seems sure to become standard within a cognitive
approach to the philosophy of science.

5. Another assumption shared by Logical Empiricists and most of their
historically based critics is that the basic entities in an account of
science are abstractions like "theories," "methods," or "research
traditions" (which for both Lakatos and Laudan are explicitly
characterized in terms of laws, theories, and methodological rules).
Nersessian, by contrast, insists on including the individual
scientist as an essential part of her account. Her question is not
simply how the theory of electrodynamics developed from the time of
Faraday to that of Einstein, but how Faraday, Maxwell, and Einstein, as
individual scientists, developed electrodynamics. Theories do not
simply develop; they are developed through the cognitive activities
of particular scientists. It is the focus on scientists, as real
people, that makes possible the application of notions from cognitive
psychology to questions in the philosophy of science.

6. Nersessian's insistence on the role of human agency in science is
strongly reinforced by David Gooding's analysis of the path from actual
experimentation to the creation of demonstration experiments, to the
development of theory. Insisting that all accounts of scientific
activity, even those recorded in laboratory notebooks, involve
reconstruction, Gooding distinguishes six types, or levels, of
reconstruction. Standard philosophical reconstructions, which Gooding
labels "normative," are last in the sequence. The first are "cognitive"
reconstructions, with "rhetorical" and "didactic" reconstructions being
among the intermediate types. Gooding is particularly insistent on the
importance of "procedural knowledge," such as laboratory skills, in the
cognitive development of science.

7. Gooding concludes his paper by arguing that the power of thought
experiments derives in part from the fact that they embody tacit
knowledge of experimental procedures. This argument complements
Nersessian's analysis of how an "experiment" carried out in thought can
have such an apparently powerful empirical force. She argues that
conducting a thought experiment is to be understood as using a mental
model of the experimental situation to run a simulation of a real
experiment. The empirical content is built into the mental model, which
includes procedural knowledge.

8. Ryan Tweney was among the first of recent theorists to advocate a
cognitive approach to the study of science, and he has pursued this
approach in both experimental and historical contexts. Here he explores
some implications of the recent vogue for parallel processing for the
study of science as a cognitive process. Tweney acknowledges the
importance of having models which could plausibly be implemented in a
human brain, but he is less impressed by neuroscientific plausibility
than by the promise of realistic psychological models of perception,
imagery, and memory -- all of which he regards as central to the
process of science.

9. Rather than joining the debate between advocates of serial and parallel
models, Tweney takes a third route which focuses attention on cognitive
activities in natural contexts -- leaving the question of which sort of
model best fits such contexts to be decided empirically on a case by
case basis. But it is clear that Tweney is impressed with the promise
of parallel models, even though, as he points out, they have yet to be
applied very successfully to higher level cognitive processes. Here he
considers two applications: (1) an account of the memory aids used by
Michael Faraday to index his notebooks, and (2) Paul Thagard's analysis
of scientific revolutions using a parallel network implementation
(ECHO) of a theory of explanatory coherence. He finds the concept of
parallel processing useful in the first case but superfluous in the
second.

10. For nearly two decades, sociologists of science have been gathering
under a banner labeled "The Social Construction of Scientific
Knowledge." The above papers suggest that we can equally well speak of
"The Cognitive Construction of Scientific Knowledge." There are,
however, two important differences in the ways these programs are
conceived. First, unlike social constructionists, cognitive
constructionists make no claims of exclusivity. We do not insist that
cognitive construction is all there is. Second, social constructionists
typically deny, or claim indifference to, any genuine representational
connection between the claims of scientists and an independently
existing world. By contrast, connections with the world are built into
the cognitive construction of scientific knowledge. This is
particularly clear in Gooding's paper, which emphasizes the role of
procedural knowledge in science.

11. The historical movement in the philosophy of science made conceptual
change a focus of research in the history and philosophy of science. It
has subsequently become a research area within cognitive psychology as
well, although Piaget had already made it a focus of psychological
research in Europe several decades earlier. Indeed, one major strand of
current research may be seen as an extension of Piaget's program which
used conceptual development in children as a model for conceptual
development in science (Gruber and Voneche 1977). This line of research
is represented here by Susan Carey.

12. Carey works within the "nativist" tradition which holds that at least
some concepts are innate, presumably hard-wired as the result of our
evolutionary heritage. The question is what happens to the conceptual
structure possessed by a normal human in the natural course of
maturation, apart from explicit schooling. An extreme view is that
conceptual development consists only of "enrichment," that is, coming
to believe new propositions expressed solely in terms of the original
set of innate concepts. Another possible view is that humans also form
new concepts by differentiation and combination. Objects become
differentiated to include animals, then dogs. Colors become
differentiated into red, green, blue, etc. Combination produces the
concept of a red dog (an Irish Setter). Carey argues that normal
development also produces conceptual systems that are, in Kuhn's (1983)
terms, "locally incommensurable" with earlier systems.

13. Carey takes pains to argue that local incommensurability between
children's and adults' concepts does not mean that adults and children
cannot understand one another, that children do not learn language by
interacting with adults, or that psychologists cannot explain the
child's conceptual system to others. So the concept of
incommensurability used here has none of the disastrous implications
often associated with philosophical uses of this notion. It seems,
therefore, that philosophers and psychologists may at last have
succeeded in taming the concept of incommensurability, turning it into
something that can do useful work.

14. The shift from novice to expert provides another model recently
exploited by cognitive psychologists to study conceptual change in
science. Michelene Chi has been a leader in this research. Here,
however, she treats conceptual change in more general terms. She argues
that even Carey's notion of change between incommensurable conceptual
systems is not strong enough to capture the radical nature of the
seventeenth-century revolution in physics. That revolution, she
argues, involved a more radical conceptual shift because there was a
shift in ontological categories. In particular, the conceptual system
prior to the scientific revolution mainly used concepts within the
ontological category of "material substance" whereas the new physical
concepts were mainly relational, covering what she calls "constraint
based events." According to Chi's analysis, therefore, the difficulty
people have moving beyond an undifferentiated weight/density concept is
due to difficulty in conceiving of weight as relational rather than
substantial. Density, being an intrinsic property of objects (mass per
unit volume), is developmentally the more primitive concept.

15. The final two papers in this section use a cognitive approach to
problems that were prominent among Logical Empiricists. Questions about
the nature of observation, and, more technically, measurement, were
high on the agenda of Logical Empiricism. That was in large part
because of the foundational role of observation in empiricist
epistemology. But even if one abandons foundationist epistemology,
there are still interesting questions to be asked about observation and
measurement. Richard Grandy explores several such issues from the
general perspective of cognitive agents as information processors.

16. One topic Grandy explores is the relative information provided by the
use of various types of measurement scales. Grandy demonstrates that
the potential information carried by a measurement typically increases
as one moves from nominal, to ordinal, to ratio scales. More
surprising, he is able to show that what he would regard as observation
sentences typically convey more information than ordinal scale
measurements, though not as much as ratio scale measurements. This is
but one step in a projected general program to analyze the
contributions of new theories, instruments, and methods of data
analysis in terms of their efficiency as information generators or
processors. Such an analysis would provide a "cognitive" measure of
scientific progress.

17. In the final paper of this section, Wade Savage explores the
possibility of using recent cognitive theories of perception to develop
a naturalized foundationalist empiricism. He begins by distinguishing
strong from weak foundationalism. Strong foundationalism is the view
that some data provided by sensation or perception are both independent
(not based on further data) and infallible (incapable of error). Weak
foundationalism holds only that some data of sensation or perception are
more independent and more reliable than other data. Savage's view is
that weak foundationalism provides a framework for a naturalistic
theory of conscious human knowledge and strong foundationalism
provides a framework for a naturalistic theory of unconscious human
knowledge. The mistake of the classical foundationalists, he claims,
is to have assumed that strong foundationalism could be a theory of
conscious knowledge.

III. MODELS FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

18. Among the many cross currents within the fields of computer science and
artificial intelligence is a tension between those who wish to use the
computer as a means to study the functioning of human intelligence and
those who see the computer primarily as a tool for performing a variety
of tasks quite apart from how humans might in fact perform those same
tasks. This tension is evident in the original work on "discovery
programs" inspired by Herbert Simon (1977) and implemented by Pat
Langley, Simon, and others (Langley et al 1987). This work has
demonstrated the possibility of developing programs which can uncover
significant regularities in various types of data using quite general
heuristics. Among the prototypes of such programs are BACON, GLAUBER,
and KAKEDA (Kulkarni and Simon 1988). BACON, for example, easily
generates Kepler's laws beginning only with simple data on planetary
orbits.

19. One way of viewing such programs is as providing "normative models" in
the straightforward instrumental sense that these models provide good
means for accomplishing well-defined goals. This use of AI is exhibited
in this volume by the papers of Gary Bradshaw and Lindley Darden.
Bradshaw, who began his career working with Simon and Langley, applies
Simon's general approach to problem solving to invention in technology.
He focuses on the much discussed historical question of why the Wright
brothers were more successful at solving the problem of manned flight
than their many competitors. Dismissing a variety of previous
historical explanations, Bradshaw locates the crucial difference in the
differing heuristics of the Wright brothers and their competitors. The
Wright brothers, he argues, isolated a small number of functional
problems which they proceeded to solve one at a time. They were thus
exploring a relatively small "function space" while their competitors
were exploring a much larger "design space."

20. Darden proposes applying AI techniques developed originally for
diagnosing breakdowns in technological systems to the problem of
"localizing" and "fixing" mistaken assumptions in a theory which is
faced with contrary data. Here she outlines the program and sketches an
application to the resolution of an empirical anomaly in the history of
Mendelian genetics. Darden is quite clear on the goal of her work:
"The goal," she writes, "is not the simulation of human scientists, but
the making of discoveries about the natural world, using methods that
extend human cognitive capacities."

21. Programs like those of Darden and others are potentially of great
scientific utility. That potential is already clear enough to inspire
many people to develop them further. How useful such programs will
actually prove to be is not something that can be decided a priori. We
will have to wait and see. The implications of these sorts of programs
for a cognitive philosophy of science are mainly indirect. The fact
that they perform as well as they do can tell us something about the
structure of the domains in which they are applied and about possible
strategies for theorizing in those domains.

22. Others see AI as providing a basis for much farther reaching
philosophical conclusions. The papers by Greg Nowak and Paul Thagard,
and by Eric Freedman, apply Thagard's (1989) theory of explanatory
coherence (TEC) to the Copernican revolution and to a controversy in
psychology respectively. Nowak and Thagard hold both (a) that the
objective superiority of the Copernican theory over the Ptolemic theory
is shown by its greater overall explanatory coherence, and (b) that the
triumph of the Copernican theory was due, at least in part, to the
intuitive perception of its greater explanatory coherence by
participants at the time.

23. Thagard, who advocates a "computational philosophy of science" (Thagard
1988), implements his theory of explanatory coherence in a
connectionist program, ECHO, which utilizes localized representations
of propositions. It has been questioned (for example by Glymour and
Tweney in this volume) whether ECHO is doing anything more than
functioning as a fancy calculator. All the real work seems to be done
by the conditions for explanatory coherence -- which have nothing
essential to do with research in cognitive science.

24. Freedman's study provides a partial response to these objections. He
uses TEC and ECHO to analyze the famous controversy between Tolman and
Hull over the significance of Tolman's latent learning experiments.
Applying TEC and ECHO, Freedman finds that Tolman's cognitive theory is
favored over Hull's behaviorist theory. Yet historically, Hull's
approach prevailed for many years. By varying available parameters in
ECHO, Freeman shows several ways in which ECHO can be made to deliver a
verdict in favor of Hull. For example, significantly decreasing the
importance of the latent learning data can tip the balance in favor of
Hull's theory. To Freedman, this provides at least a suggestion for how
the actual historical situation might be explained. So ECHO does some
work. But this study also makes it obvious that to decide among the
possibilities suggested by varying different parameters in ECHO, one
would have to do traditional historical research. ECHO cannot decide
the issue.

IV. MODELS FROM NEUROSCIENCE

25. The relevance of models from the neurosciences to the philosophy of
science is here argued by the primary advocate of the philosophical
relevance of such models, Paul Churchland. It is Churchland's (1989)
contention that we already know enough about the gross functioning of
the brain to make significant claims about the nature of scientific
knowledge and scientific reasoning. Here he argues that a
"neurocomputational" perspective vindicates (more precisely, "reduces")
a number of claims long advocated by Paul Feyerabend. For example:
"competing theories can be, and occasionally are, incommensurable,"
and "the long term best interests of intellectual progress require that
we proliferate not only theories, but research methodologies as
well."

26. Whatever one's opinion of Churchland's particular claims, I think we
must all agree that the neurosciences provide a very powerful and
indisputable constraint on any cognitive philosophy of science.
Whatever cognitive model of scientific theorizing and reasoning one
proposes, it has to be a model that can be implemented by humans
using human brains.

V. BETWEEN LOGIC AND SOCIOLOGY

27. Except during momentary lapses of enthusiasm, no one thinks that a
cognitive theory of science could be a complete theory of science.
The cognitive activities of scientists are embedded in a social fabric
whose contribution to the course of scientific development may be as
great as that of the cognitive interactions between scientists and the
natural world. Thus cognitive models of science need to be supplemented
with social models. The only requirement is that the two families of
models fit together in a coherent fashion.

28. There are those among contemporary sociologists of science who are not
so accommodating. Latour and Woolgar, for example, are now famous for
suggesting a ten year moratorium on cognitive studies of science, by
which time they expect to have constructed a complete theory of science
which requires no appeal to cognitive categories. Such voices are not
directly represented in this volume, but they do have supporters
nonetheless.

29. Houts and Haddock agree with the sociological critics of cognitivism in
rejecting the use of cognitive categories like representation or
judgment in a theory of science. But they insist there is need for a
genuine psychology of science. From a cognitivist point of view, these
are incompatible positions. For Houts and Haddock these positions are
not incompatible because their psychology of science is based on the
behaviorist principles of B. F. Skinner. In Skinnerian theory, the
determinants of behavior are to be found in the environment, both
natural and social, which provides the contingencies of reinforcement.
There is no need for any appeal to "mental" categories such as
representation or judgment. Several commentators, for example Slezak
(1989) and myself (Giere 1988), have criticized behaviorist tendencies
in the writings of sociologists of science. For Houts and Haddock,
these tendencies are not a basis for criticism, but a positive virtue.
They make possible a unified approach to both the psychology and the
sociology of science.

30. Within cognitive psychology there is a tradition, already several
decades old, in which scientific reasoning tasks are simulated in a
laboratory setting. Gorman reviews this tradition and compares it with
the more recent tradition of computational simulation pioneered by
Simon and represented in this volume by Thagard. He relies heavily on
the distinction between externally valid and ecologically valid claims.
A claim is externally valid if it generalizes well to other
well-controlled, idealized conditions. A claim is ecologically valid
if it generalizes well to natural settings, for example, to the
reasoning of scientists in their laboratories. Gorman argues that,
while both laboratory and computer simulations may be externally valid,
laboratory studies are more ecologically valid. Granting this
conclusion, however, does little to remove doubts about the ecological
validity of laboratory studies themselves.

31. Gorman proposes bridging the gap between cognitive and social studies
of science by designing experimental simulations which include social
interactions among the participants. Here experimental paradigms from
social psychology are merged with those that have been used in the
experimental study of scientific reasoning. Gorman's hope is that one
might eventually develop experimental tests of claims made by
sociologists as well as by more theoretical "social epistemologists"
such as Steve Fuller.

32. Fuller himself questions a central presupposition of most cognitive
approaches to the philosophy of science, namely, that the individual
scientist is the right unit of analysis for any theory of science. Not
that he advocates returning to abstract entities like theories. Rather
he thinks that the appropriate unit will turn out to be something more
like a biological species than an individual scientist. Bruno Latour's
(1987) "actor network" may be a good example of the kind of thing
Fuller expects might emerge as the proper unit of study. Fuller's
argument is both historical and critical. He sketches an account of how
the individual scientist came to be regarded as the basic entity for
epistemology generally and why this assumption has led to difficulties
in several areas, particularly in analytic epistemology, but also in
Churchland's neurocomputational approach.

VI. CRITIQUE AND REPLIES

33. Clark Glymour was among the first philosophers of science to grasp the
possibility of deploying methods and results from the cognitive
sciences, particularly artificial intelligence, in the philosophy of
science itself. (Herbert Simon, who I definitely would wish to claim as
a philosopher of science, must surely have been the first.) But as his
contribution to this volume makes crystal clear, Glymour is quite
disappointed with what some other philosophers of science have been
doing with this strategy. Here he expresses his disappointment with
work by three of the participants in the Minnesota workshop,
Churchland, Thagard, and Giere. By mutual agreement, Glymour's comments
appear as he wrote them. They are followed by replies from each of the
three named subjects of his remarks.

        INSTRUCTIONS FOR PSYCOLOQUY AUTHORS AND COMMENTATORS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 35,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral, cognitive, neural, social, etc.)
All contributions are refereed by members of PSYCOLOQUY's Editorial Board.

Target article length should normally not exceed 500 lines [c. 4000 words].
Commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines [c. 1600 words].

All target articles, commentaries and responses must have (1) a short
abstract (up to 100 words for target articles, shorter for commentaries
and responses), (2) an indexable title, (3) the authors' full name(s)
and institutional address(es).

In addition, for target articles only: (4) 6-8 indexable keywords,
(5) a separate statement of the authors' rationale for soliciting
commentary (e.g., why would commentary be useful and of interest to the
field? what kind of commentary do you expect to elicit?) and
(6) a list of potential commentators (with their email addresses).

All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries and
responses (see format of already published articles in the PSYCOLOQUY
archive; line length should be < 80 characters, no hyphenation).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

COMPLEX REPRESENTATIONS:
THE PLACE OF INDICATOR SEMANTICS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE

*Complex Representations:  The Place of Indicator Semantics in
Cognitive Science* is the theme of a conference sponsored by the
Department of Philosophy, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the
Center for the Study of Science in Society at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, to be held March 18-20, 1994, at
Mountain Lake Resort, Blacksburg, Virginia.

Indicator semantics, and similar teleological accounts of
representation, have enjoyed remarkable success in explaining low-
level cognitive processing.  The question now arises whether
indicator semantics could be extended to explain the higher level
representational capacity of more complex organisms -- in
particular, humans.  This conference will address will address such
an elaboration -- its viability, desirability, and potential
consequences for the cognitive sciences.

        BEYOND MODULARITY: A DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE ON COGNITIVE

                annette@cdu.ucl.ac.uk

    KEYWORDS: cognitive development, connectionism, constructivism,
    developmental stages, Fodor, modularity, nativism, Piaget,
    representational redescription, species differences.

    ABSTRACT: Beyond Modularity attempts a synthesis of Fodor's
    anti-constructivist nativism and Piaget's anti-nativist
    constructivism.  Contra Fodor, I argue that: (1) the study of
    cognitive development is essential to cognitive science, (2) the
    module/central processing dichotomy is too rigid, and (3) the mind
    does not begin with prespecified modules, but that development
    involves a gradual process of modularization. Contra Piaget, I
    argue that: (1) development rarely involves stage-like
    domain-general change, and (2) domain-specific predispositions give
    development a small but significant kickstart by focusing the
    infant's attention on proprietary inputs. Development does not
    stop at efficient learning. A fundamental aspect of human
    development ("Representational Redescription") is the hypothesized
    process by which information that is IN a cognitive system becomes
    progressively explicit knowledge TO that system. Development thus
    involves two complementary processes of progressive modularization
    and rendering explicit. Empirical findings on the child as
    linguist, physicist, mathematician, psychologist and notator are
    discussed in support of the theoretical framework.  Each chapter
    concentrates first on the initial state of the infant mind/brain
    and on subsequent domain-specific learning in infancy and early
    childhood. They then go on to explore data on older children's
    problem solving and theory building, with particular focus on
    evolving cognitive flexibility. Throughout the book there is an
    emphasis on the status of representations underlying different
    capacities and on the multiple levels at which knowledge is stored
    and accessible. Finally, consideration is given to the need for
    more formal developmental models, and the Representational
    Redescription framework is compared with connectionist simulations
    of development. The concluding sections consider what is special
    about human cognition and offer some speculations about the status
    of representations underlying the structure of behavior in other
    species.

    KEYWORDS: culture; evolution; group selection; kin selection;
    inclusive fitness; natural selection; reciprocity; social
    organization; units of selection.

    ABSTRACT: In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are
    sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be
    reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is
    opposed by a more individualistic view that treats social
    organization as a byproduct of self-interest. According to
    biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of
    natural selection at the group level. During the 1960's and 70's
    most biologists rejected group selection as an important
    evolutionary force but a positive literature began to grow during
    the 70's and is rapidly expanding today. We review this recent
    literature and its implications for human evolutionary biology. We
    show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced
    emphasis on genes as "replicators" which is in fact irrelevant to
    the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their
    functional organization. The fundamental question is whether social
    groups and other higher-level entities can be "vehicles" of
    selection. When this elementary fact is recognized, group selection
    emerges as an important force in nature and ostensible
    alternatives, such as kin selection and reciprocity, reappear as
    special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of
    natural selection that operates on a nested hierarchy of units.

    The vehicle-based theory makes it clear that group selection is an
    important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can
    facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals
    to "organs" of group-level "organisms." Human behavior not only
    reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also
    alter the balance through the construction of social structures
    that have the effect of reducing fitness differences within groups,
    concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at
    the group level.  These social structures and the cognitive
    abilities that produce them allow group selection to be important
    even among large groups of unrelated individuals.

My reply is simple: Yes, robotic grounding consists of correlations --
correlations among (1) things in the robot's environment, (2) the
"shadows" those things cast on the robot's transducers, (3) the robot's
internal states, and (4) what the robot can and does do in the world.
But HAVING robotic capacities means INSTANTIATING those correlations,
not merely ENCODING them. And that's what grounding calls for. I could
encode it all in a book, but that would be just as ungrounded as a more
dynamic encoding in a computer, because it would lack the robotic
capacity itself, the capacity to interact with the objects, events and
states-of-affairs in the world that all the symbols -- and correlations
-- are otherwise merely INTERPRETABLE as being about.

Symbol grounding requires complete autonomy from external
interpretation, an unmediated CAUSAL CONNECTION between symbols and
their objects (not just interpretable correlations between symbols and
symbols, and between symbols and interpretations). In my model, that
autonomy comes from robotic interaction capacity (T3-scale) with the
objects the symbols are about; as a matter of LOGIC, that cannot be
done by anything (symbols, codes, correlations) unless it is causally
connected to those objects. And causal connection requires
transduction. (And I don't care at all whether, at root, transduction
is continuous or discrete; the point is merely that it's not just
symbolic, and hence can't be done by just a digital computer.)

I will also point out below that the idea that the role of grounding is
merely to "tune" internal symbolic states is homuncular and incorrect.
Grounding is not a channel TO a homunculus; it is PART of the homunculus
(i.e., part of ME).

My dictionary-go-round example is meant to give a flavor of WHY and HOW a
symbol system is ungrounded, but it is not a demonstration. There is no
way to show that it is evident that a system lacks meaning. (Not even
Searle's Argument is a demonstration; Searle just shows that if you
wanted to keep believing that every implementation of a T2-[Turing
Test]-passing computer program understands, it would be at the price of
believing either that (a) Searle would really come to understand
Chinese [consciously, of course] if he just manipulated enough
meaningless symbols, or, worse, that (b) manipulating meaningless
symbols would generate a second, Chinese-understanding mind in Searle,
of which he was not consciously aware. The other-minds problem rules
out any stronger evidence than this; to know for sure whether or not
it understands [indeed, whether or not anyone is home in there], you'd
have to BE the system -- as Searle is, in (a).)

Nor is grounding a guarantor of meaning (CONSCIOUS meaning, that is,
which is the only kind there is, by my lights, but that's another story
[Harnad1993c]). A system (even T3-scale) could be grounded yet there
might STILL be no meaning in there. The only thing grounding immunizes
against is the objection that the connection between symbols and what
they are interpretable as meaning is mediated by an external
interpreter. Groundedness guarantees autonomy from external
interpretation.

This is no objection. The pertinent property of the transducers is what
J.J. Gibson called "affordances": There are, for example, many ways to
transduce light, and many ways to get spatial cues from it to guide
spatial locomotion. But the information really has to be there, in the
sensory signal, and the transducer really has to pick it up. There are
countless things that "afford" sittability-upon. The only invariant
they share is that they are all hospitable to the shapes of our
posteriors. And our posteriors might have been shaped otherwise. So
what? None of this makes "being able to be sat upon" an arbitrary
property. And it is properties like THAT that the robot must be able to
pick up and use, in generating its T3-scale capacity.

How long that nonarbitrary shape is PRESERVED in analog form in the internal
processing it undergoes (as opposed to being discretized and going into
symbols) is not at issue; some tasks (like mental rotation) look as if
they might be performed by preserving the shape of the sensory input
right through to the motor output; others, like estimating coordinates,
look as if they go quickly into symbols. The essential point is that
ALL these capacities are grounded in the nonarbitrary shapes of
sensorimotor icons and invariants at the transducer surface.

Another mistake in the examples below is focussing on the PHENOMENAL
quality of the sensory signal, instead of the robotic capacity itself,
and its (nonarbitrary) relation to the world. The nonarbitrariness is
not so much concerned with what a thing LOOKS like, subjectively, but
with what you can DO with it (as in the case of the invariants that
subserve sittability-upon), objectively, in relation to its physical
"shape" and the "shape" of the "shadow" it casts on your sensory
surfaces.

All true. But all this means is that (a) the invariants that "afford"
our actual color discrimination and identification capacity are not
unique (that there is more than one way to skin the same robotic cat)
or that (b) if things had evolved differently, we would have had
different robotic capacities. Neither of these contradicts the
nonarbitrariness of the invariants in the sensorimotor projection
that the system would have to pick up in any case.

Here the focus on phenomenology has even injected some of the
confusions that arise from homuncular thinking (about a
little-man-in-the-head who "sees" our inputs). Of course spatial
locomotion involves correlations. The correlations may not be unique
ones, but they are hardly arbitrary. And their nonarbitrariness has
nothing to do with what would be right-side-up to a homunculus!
And, in the end, which are the correlations that really matter: It is
the correlations between sensorimotor input and output, the shape of
neither of which is arbitrary.

Correlations, yes, but between arbitrary shapes? Not at all. Shape
invariants and their intercorrelations are underdetermined, no doubt
(thank goodness, for if there were only one way, nature might never
have had the time to find it), but hardly arbitrary (what's arbitrary is
the "shape" of formal symbol tokens). And again, the pertinent thing about
the correlations is their PHYSICAL REALIZATION in actual robotic
interactions. The correlations, if you wish, are wider than the robot's
head; they are not just correlations (between symbols) WITHIN the
robot's head; to suppose they are is homuncular (and hermeneutic --
interpreting the symbols and their correlations as a homunculus's
thoughts about objects).

But where do you think the sensory projections come from? They are
shadows of the mushrooms. And the correlation is between what the robot
can do with THIS kind of mushroom and not THAT kind of mushroom:
Mushrooms "afford" edibility, toadstools do not. The homuncular picture
(of a little man in the head doing correlations) is simply, well,
wrong-headed. The edible mushroom has a nonarbitrary shape; it's shadow
on the robot's transducer surfaces does too; and whatever is going on
inside, the punchline has to be that the robot eats the right shapes and
does not eat the wrong shapes. All that sounds pretty nonarbitrary to
me, and pretty shape-dependent too. The grounding problem then becomes:
how to "connect" inner symbols to the right nonarbitrary shapes, and
how those connections constrain what would otherwise be just the syntactic
combinatory activity of ungrounded symbols (my candidate happens to be
neural nets that connect sensory projections to the symbolic names for
perceptual categories by filtering out their invariants).

I have repeatedly written that I have no vested interests either in
whether nature is basically discrete or continuous, or in whether
robot-internal processes are discrete or continuous. What I mean by
"analog" is, in the end, just "physical," described by differential
equations rather than implementation-independent symbol manipulation.
And no matter how you discretize it, the transduction of photons is a
physical process, not a computational one, and a real optical
transducer will always be one kind of physical object, and a virtual
transducer (a computer-simulated transducer) will be another. (At this
juncture, those who have not understood this point about the physical
nature of transduction usually confuse things still further by invoking
virtual worlds: but those are just inputs to HUMAN SENSES -- which are,
as far as I know, REAL (not VIRTUAL) transducers...)

To summarize: the critical transaction transpiring at the transducer
surface is non-negotiable: Everything else from there on in may
conceivably be replaceable by a digital computer (in principle, if not
in practice), but sensorimotor transduction itself is not; yet that is
the critical locus and causal vehicle of the "correlations" that are
really at issue here.

About higher-order versus lower-order symbols, see Harnad (1993c).
The short answer is that higher-order symbols have about as good
a chance of breaking out of the hermeneutic circle as an acrostic does:
If the lower-order symbols are just ungrounded squiggles and squoggles,
then that's all the higher-order ones are, and vice-versa.

This does not show how to break out of the dictionary-go-round. Be it
ever so "rich" and intercorrelated, it still sounds like the cacophony
of meaningless symbols to me (unless I project an interpretation onto
it).

Here comes the Cheshire Cat's Grin (or, to mix metaphors, the
ungrounded symbols, hanging from a skyhook): Sure there are lots of
correlations within robot-internal states that go into delivering T3
power. But in and of themselves, they deliver nothing. (It would be an
instance of the mirror-image of the virtual-world confusion alluded to
above to equate the inner states of a REAL Helen-Keller-Stephen-Hawking
-- which still consist mostly of transduction, albeit damaged
transduction -- with the inner states of a digital computer, which
could never do ON ITS OWN what even H-K-S-H can still do; the computer
could only do so if you ADDED sensorimotor transducers to it
(transducers that, I repeat, H-K-S-H does not lack).

Here is an intuition pump that has sometimes worked (I've even posted
it here a few times): "I AM a (sensorimotor) transducer." I may not be
JUST a sensorimotor transducer (I may even be part digital computer),
but something that is JUST digital computer is not, and cannot be, me
(or anybody), no matter what correlations it encodes, because the RIGHT
correlations for implementing ME include the (causal capacity for)
sensorimotor interaction as an ESSENTIAL component. To suppose
otherwise is just to be seduced by homuncular hermeneutics on symbols
(their intercorrelations among themselves and their systematic
"correlation" with what they are interpretable as being about).

And no, sensorimotor grounding is not merely the standard way that the
inner correlations happen to get SET (by evolution and learning) in
real time. It is the implementation of the sensorimotor capacity
itself, in the here-and-now, that makes me me (a T3 robot could have
sprung fully formed out of the head of Zeus, and it would STILL be
grounded if it did indeed have T3 capacity; its "inner correlations,"
severed from its sensorimotor apparatus, on the other hand, would be
nothing, no one, no better than a Chinese/Chinese dictionary [which has
plenty of correlations too, by the way]).

You could build even a T3 robot without any real-time history of any kind,
and its internal symbols would be grounded (interpreter-independent) in
virtue of its T3 (CAUSAL) capacity. But if you just had a T2 symbol
system that was interpretable as performing the "right" correlations --
and even if that symbol system had previously been a proper part of the
T3 robot itself -- the symbols in that system would nevertheless be just
as ungrounded as the intergalactic vacuum (or the robot's assembly-manual).

To put it another way: A T3 system, sitting here, idling, is still
perfectly grounded, in virtue of its REAL sensorimotor capacity, a kind
of physical potential it really has. On the other hand, a pure
symbol-crunching module, chugging away, with its symbols ever so
systematically interpretable, and its correlations all raring to go, if
only it were reinserted in a T3 robot, is ungrounded, because it has NO
sensorimotor capacity. "Capacity" may mean "potential," but the
"potential capacity" of such a system is getting TOO potential; in
reality, it is T3 impotent (otherwise, by that token, a single
flip-flop would already be a potential computer, hence mind, too!)

This is too big a topic to take up here. The short answer is that I
believe that all higher-order, abstract terms are grounded in
lower-order ones (that are grounded in... etc,) and ultimately in
sensorimotor categories. (See my discussion of the "peekaboo unicorn" in
Harnad 1992a.) Grounding is recursive, in mind-building as much as in
skyscraper building. Nothing hangs from a skyhook; you have to get there
bottom-up.

That said, it IS possible to "do" mathematics as pure symbol
manipulation (along the lines that the formalists would say ALL of
mathematics goes). Everyone who uses a "cookbook formula" mechanically,
without understanding what he's doing, is doing that. But then you are
in Searle's Chinese Room, and there really IS no understanding or
meaning going on. (I doubt that that's what the formalists had in mind;
certainly Roger Penrose does not think that's all that's going on in the
mathematician's mind.)

This is answered by the affordance and sensorimotor correlation
discussion above. And grounding could not be just a matter of
restricting symbol combinations, otherwise one could have said a priori
that all grounding required was the right set of syntactic rules, hence
there was no symbol grounding problem. The symbol grounding problem is
the problem of getting the external interpreter out of the causal loop
that connects symbols to what they are about.

You can digitize what comes AFTER the transduction, internally, but you
can't digitize the sensorimotor transduction itself.

No, grounding is not just the education of an inner symbolic
homunculus. Nor is it just providing the right data to tune a pure
symbol cruncher. We ARE sensorimotor transducers (at least in part),
and our symbols are grounded in our ACTUAL sensorimotor capacities.
So a grounded symbol system is fated to be more than just a symbol
system. I'm betting the hybridism is analog/neural-net/symbolic,
with the lion's share of the load borne by the analog component.

But, like Helen Keller and Stephen Hawking, abstract mathematicians are
themselves grounded sensorimotor systems, so nothing follows about
ungrounded symbol systems from any of this. And we are not interested
in what properties can be ASCRIBED to systems (by interpreting them)
but in what properties they really HAVE, autonomously, over and above
their systematic interpretability. EVERYTHING, besides (a) having the
properties it really has, is also (b) systematically interpretable as
having those properties; but virtual systems (ungrounded symbol
systems) have only (b)  -- AS virtual systems: we all know what a
digital computer REALLY is, independent of what it might be
interpretable as simulating.

Beware the Cheshire Cat's Grin.

RADICAL PHILOSOPHY
pub/Journals_Books_and_Conferences/Radical_Philosophy

The table of contents and the first page of each article for the
upcoming issue of Radical Philosophy, RP66, are now available on the
IPPE.

RADICAL PHILOSOPHY is a journal of socialist and feminist philosophy.
It was founded in 1972 in response to the widely felt discontent with
the sterility of academic philosophy at the time (in Britain completely
dominated by the narrowest sort of "ordinary language" philosophy), with
the purpose of providing a forum for the theoretical work which was
emerging in the wake of the radical movements of the 1960s, in
philosophy and other fields.

RADICAL PHILOSOPHY is not committed to any particular philosophy,
ideology or political programme.  The purpose of the journal is to
provide a forum for debate and discussion of theoretical issues on the
left.  It encourages the serious and informed discussion of such issues
in clear and non-technical language, aimed to reach a wide audience.

As well as major academic articles, it has a large and diverse book
reviews section (covering 25-30 books per issue), as well as News and
Commentary sections.

Comments on the Symbol Grounding Problem
preprints/Phil_of_Mind

A solution to the symbol grounding problem proposed by Harnad requires 
giving a system both linguistic and sensorimotor capacity indistinguishable 
from those of a human. The symbols are then grounded by the fact that analog 
sensorimotor projections on transducer surfaces, coming from the real world 
objects, and successively formed sensory invariants of nonarbitrary shape 
constrain the symbol combinations over and above what is imposed by syntax, 
and tie the symbols to those real objects.
 It is argued here that full sensorimotor capacity may indeed be a crucial 
factor, since it is capable of providing the symbols (corresponding 
to language terms) with a deep underlying structure. This structure is 
a network of intricate correlations among them at a level of primitive 
symbols based on inputs from the transducers. On the other hand, 
the nonarbitrary shapes of sensory invariants, as well as the analog nature 
of sensorimotor projections seem to be of no consequence. Grounding is then 
seen as coming from this low-level correlation structure which mirrors
the ouside world relationships, as experienced by the system. Once known, 
such a correlation structure could in principle be programmed into a system 
without the need for transducers.

Randomness & Complexity in Pure Mathematics
preprints/Logic

[pub: _International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos_, Vol. 4, No. 1,
February 1994]

One normally thinks that everything that is true is true for a reason.
I've found mathematical truths that are true for no reason at all. These
mathematical truths are beyond the power of mathematical reasoning
because they are accidental and random.

   Using software written in Mathematica that runs on an IBM RS/6000
workstation, I constructed a perverse 200-page algebraic equation with
a parameter N and 17,000 unknowns:

            Left-Hand-Side(N) = Right-Hand-Side(N).

For each whole-number value of the parameter N, ask whether this
equation has a finite or an infinite number of whole number solutions.
The answers escape the power of mathematical reason because they are
completely random and accidental.

   This work is an extension of famous results of G"odel and Turing
using ideas from a new field called algorithmic information theory.

Japanese Buddhism and Its Impact on Japanese Culture: An Observation
preprints/Phil_of_Religion

Ever since the introduction of Buddhism in Japan in the middle of the
sixth century through China and Korea, Japanese life and culture have
showed a blended influence consisting of Chinese Confucianism, Mahayana
Buddhism, and its indigenous Shintoism; how ever, with the more
realistic and democratic role as to religion assumed by the Emperor and
the alteration made by erudite monks, Buddhism, though at the beginning
faced mild resistance from Shinto, had adjusted to the many
cross-currents of Japanese and outlandish thought, the three more or
less supplementing one another. But Buddhism has given birth to numerous
sects and sub-sects which have mingled with both Shinto and Confucianist
traits and even today `there are many houses in Japan where one room
contains invariably a Buddhist altar, but another a miniature Shinto'.
An attempt has been made in this paper to identify the reasons for the
segmentation of Buddhism in Japan and to focus on Buddhist contribution
to Japanese life and culture with a view to showing that both society
and religion can interact with one another without confronting with
social strife or communal disharmony.

International Philosophical Preprint Exchange Update
==================================================== Fri 11 Mar 1994

Many of you have inquired as to the easiest way to view the contents of
the IPPE, which currently includes: a large collection of preprints
covering every area of philosophy; the abstracts, tables of contents,
and editorial summaries of the journals and book series in our Journals,
Books, and Conferences directory; and which will soon include a
Dialogues directory.

I personally prefer our graphic illustration of the IPPE,
Map_of_the_IPPE, although more textually minded philosophers will prefer
our INDEX file.  Both are updated daily and are available on the IPPE in
our main directory.

                SELF-CONTROL: BEYOND COMMITMENT

                Howard Rachlin
                Psychology Department
                SUNY at Stony Brook
                Stony Brook, NY  11794-2500
                HRACHLIN@PSYCH.1.PSY.SUNYSB.EDU

    ABSTRACT: Self control, so important in the theory and practice of
    psychology, has usually been understood introspectively. This
    target article adopts a behavioral view of the self (as an abstract
    class of behavioral actions) and of self control (as an abstract
    behavioral pattern dominating a particular act) according to which
    the development of self control control is a molar/molecular
    conflict in the development of behavioral patterns. This subsumes
    the more typical view of self control as a now/later conflict in
    which an act of self control is a choice of a larger but later
    reinforcer over a smaller but sooner reinforcer. If at some future
    time the smaller-sooner reinforcer will be more valuable than the
    larger-later reinforcer, self control may be achieved through a
    commitment to the larger-later reinforcer prior to that point.
    According to some, there is in the development of self control a
    progressive internalization of commitment. There are theoretical
    and empirical problems with this view. In two experiments, one with
    pigeons choosing between smaller-sooner and larger-later
    reinforcers, the other with adult humans choosing between
    short-term particular and long-term abstract reinforcer, temporal
    patterning of choices increased self control.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To help you decide whether you would be an appropriate commentator for
this article, an electronic draft is retrievable by anonymous ftp from
princeton.edu according to the instructions below (the filename is
bbs.rachlin). Please do not prepare a commentary on this draft.
Just let us know, after having inspected it, what relevant expertise
you feel you would bring to bear on what aspect of the article.
The file is also retrievable using archie, gopher, veronica, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------
   To retrieve a file by ftp from an Internet site, type either:
ftp princeton.edu
   or
ftp 128.112.128.1
   When you are asked for your login, type:
anonymous
   Enter password as queried (your password is your actual userid:
   yourlogin@yourhost.whatever.whatever - be sure to include the "@")
cd /pub/harnad/BBS
   To show the available files, type:
ls
   Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example):
get bbs.rachlin
   When you have the file(s) you want, type:
quit

These files can also be retrieved using gopher, archie, veronica, etc.
----------
Where the above procedure is not available there are two fileservers:
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
       and
bitftp@pucc.bitnet
that will do the transfer for you. To one or the
other of them, send the following one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

JANET users without ftp can instead utilise the file transfer facilities
at sites uk.ac.ft-relay or uk.ac.nsf.sun.  Full details are available on
request.

    ABSTRACT: This target article presents a plausible evolutionary
    scenario for the emergence of the neural preconditions for language
    in the hominid lineage. In pleistocene primate lineages there was a
    paired evolutionary expansion of frontal and parietal neocortex
    (through certain well-documented adaptive changes associated with
    manipulative behaviors) resulting, in ancestral hominids, in an
    incipient Broca's region and in a configurationally unique junction
    of the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes of the brain (the
    POT). On our view, the development of the POT in our ancestors
    resulted in the neuroanatomical substrate consistent with the
    ability for representations in modality-neutral association cortex
    and, as a result of structure-imposing interaction with Broca's
    area, the hierarchically structured "conceptual structure." Evidence
    from paleoneurology and comparative primate neuroanatomy is used to
    argue that Homo habilis (2.5-2 million years ago) was the first
    hominid to have the appropriate gross neuroanatomical configuration
    to support conceptual structure. We thus suggest that the neural
    preconditions for language are met in H. habilis. Finally, we
    advocate a theory of language acquisition that uses conceptual
    structure as input to the learning procedures, thus bridging the
    gap between it and language.

    KEYWORDS: biology of language; conceptual structure; evolution;
    Homo habilis; language acquisition; neurolinguistics; origin of
    language; paleoneurology; preadaptation; sensorimotor feedback

This note is to announce that the latest version of my bibliography of
contemporary philosophy of mind is available.  The new version is much
more extensive than the version I distributed three or four years ago:
it has about twice as many entries, is better organized, and has more
detailed entries and annotations.

It currently consists of 1604 entries, divided into 5 parts:

1. Consciousness and Qualia                                  [410 entries]
2. Mental Content                                            [375 entries]
3. Psychophysical Relations and Psychological Explanation    [283 entries]
4. Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence                     [316 entries]
5. Miscellaneous Topics                                      [220 entries]

Most of the entries are annotated with a brief summary.  The rest I either
haven't read or haven't got around to annotating yet.  Parts 1-4 have good
coverage of the areas involved, but part 5 still needs a lot of work.  Most
areas of mainstream contemporary philosophy of mind are covered, but some
very active tangential areas, such as belief semantics and action theory,
have been mostly ignored.  The bulk of the bibliography consists of papers
and books from the last 30 years.

The bibliography is available a number of ways:

(1) By anonymous ftp from cogsci.indiana.edu, in the directory "pub", in
    the six files chalmers.bib.{intro,1,2,3,4,5}.

(2) By gopher from the APA gopher at apa.oxy.edu.

(3) By e-mail from me at dave@twinearth.wustl.edu.

There are six files totalling about 360K.  I've enclosed a summary below.
Comments, criticism, and additions are very welcome.  Apologies if you get
this message more than once -- I'm sending it to a few lists.

        ON A CONFUSION ABOUT A FUNCTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS

                Ned Block
                Department of Linguistics and Philosophy
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology

    ABSTRACT: Consciousness is a mongrel concept: there are a number of
    very different "consciousnesses." Phenomenal consciousness is
    experience; the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it
    is like to be in that state. The mark of access-consciousness, by
    contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally
    guiding speech and action. These concepts are often partly or
    totally conflated, with bad results. This target article uses as an
    example a form of reasoning about a function of "consciousness"
    based on the phenomenon of blindsight. Some information about
    stimuli in the blind field is represented in the brains of
    blindsight patients, as shown by their correct "guesses," but they
    cannot harness this information in the service of action, and this
    is said to show that a function of phenomenal consciousness is
    somehow to enable information represented in the brain to guide
    action. But stimuli in the blind field are BOTH access-unconscious
    and phenomenally unconscious. The fallacy is: an obvious function
    of the machinery of access-consciousness is illicitly transferred
    to phenomenal consciousness.

    KEYWORDS: access, attention, awareness, blindsight, consciousness,
    function, retrieval, subjective experience.

===================================
N e w s   f r o m   t h e   I P P E
===================================  18 July 1994

------------------
Summer renovations
------------------ The International Philosophical Preprint Exchange
staff is taking advantage of the slow summer season to implement some
big changes for the coming academic year.  In October, the IPPE will be
opening a World Wide Web (Mosaic) server, making possible hypertext
links between documents on the system.  In October we will also be
renovating our Gopher support, in order to provide more friendlier and
more informative menus (Gopher techies may be interested to know that we
will be running our own Gopher server, rather than using Gopher as a
front-end to our ftp server).

The current ftp and mail-server based access to the IPPE will remain
available, although there may be some reorganization to accomodate the
new Web and Gopher services.  (Please see the end of this message for
access information.)


----------------------------
More journals coming on line
---------------------------- By September several more journals will
join the roster of those journals and book series making their abstracts
and tables of contents available on the IPPE.  We have plenty of space
to accomodate yet more journals, series, and conferences, and we encourage
the staffs of these organizations to contact us.


----------------------------------
IPPE well represented at workshops
---------------------------------- Several members of the IPPE staff
were among the most prominent participants in the workshop on philosophy
and electronic communications at the Canadian Philosophical Association
conference held this past June in Calgary.  Present were Carolyn Burke
(administrator), Richard Reiner (coordinator), and Istvan Berkeley, who
was also one of the organizers of the workshop.  

Richard Reiner and George Gale of the IPPE staff will also be
participating in the round-table on computer mediated communication at
the joint PSA/SSSS/HSA conference to be held in New Orleans in October.


-----------------------------------------------------
Submission rates fluctuate, but readership stays high
----------------------------------------------------- The end of the
academic year saw a steep climb in the rate of preprint submissions to
the IPPE.  As we move into the summer season, however, submissions have
slowed to a trickle.  Usage rates, on the other hand, have remained
relatively constant at approximately one hundred accesses per day (this
does not include usage of the dozens of mirror sites through which the
IPPE collection, in association with Project Gutenberg, is available).
Anyone with a good explanation of these apparently contradictory
phenomena is invited to communicate with the IPPE staff.


----------------
IPPE Usage Study
----------------  A study of the effects on academic communication due
to emerging technologies such as the IPPE is being conducted by Charles
Schwartz, Social Sciences Bibliographer at the Fondren Library, Rice
University, in conjunction with IPPE administrator Carolyn L Burke.  We
hope to better understand the emerging changes in the structure of
communication within the philosophical community.  Results of this study
will be made available in the new year.

                THEME OF COLLOQUIUM

The modeling of mental processes in the various human cognitive
activities has generated increasing interest in the scientific world
today. Cognitive models, cognitive simulations, auto-organization,
adaptation, emergence, genetic selection, Darwinian mentalism and
enaction are active research topics in neurological and psychological
theory.

The cognitive sciences offer a continuum of research extending from the
engineering sciences to the philosophy of mind, including the
neurosciences, cognitive psychology, linguistics, semantics, semiotics
and artificial intelligence. Three subconferences will organize
themselves around the following major complementary themes: (i)
Modeling (cognitive and brain functions), (ii) Philosophy of Mind and
Epistemology, and (iii) Applications (AI, technical and computational
engineering).

(i) Modeling is a point of intersection for all these specialties
because it includes the modeling of functions and dysfunctions of the
central nervous system, the neurocomputer sciences, the modeling of
psychocognitive and mental processes, the emergence of intentional
structure on the basis of biological structure, enaction, genetic
algorithms, neural networks, artificial "life," etc.

(ii) The philosophical and epistemological subcomponent poses questions
like the following:  Can we elaborate mathematical models of the mind
and use them to describe and explain human behavior? Are we aiming
toward a mathematical model of the mind? Can we capture the formal
principles of the development and emergence of cognition? Can we
technologically recreate thought? Is the computational symbolic
paradigm, which has imposed itself for the last decades, still a
powerful conceptual tool or is it proving too reductionistic and if so,
how? What is the epistemological status of, for example, the
alternative proposed by the parallel distributed model to the
computational models of classical cognitivism? What is the relation os
the modeling activity of the cognitive and neurosciences and human
experience?

(iii) The applications subconference will consider practical domains in
which scientific results have been applied in the treatment of
language, the automated cognitive analyses of textual documents (an
intersection of linguistics, semantics, semiotics and artificial
intelligence), aids to decision making, applications in sensory
information processing, etc.

                THE SOCIOBIOLOGY OF SOCIOPATHY:
                AN INTEGRATED EVOLUTIONARY MODEL

    ABSTRACT: Sociopaths are "outstanding" members of society in two
    senses: politically, they command attention because of the
    inordinate amount of crime they commit, and psychologically, they
    elicit fascination because most of us cannot fathom the cold,
    detached way they repeatedly harm and manipulate others. Proximate
    explanations from behavior genetics, child development, personality
    theory, learning theory, and social psychology describe a complex
    interaction of genetic and physiological risk factors with
    demographic and micro-environmental variables that predispose a
    portion of the population to chronic antisocial behavior. Recent
    evolutionary and game theoretic models have tried to present an
    ultimate explanation of sociopathy as the expression of a
    frequency-dependent life history strategy which is selected, in
    dynamic equilibrium, in response to certain varying environmental
    circumstances. This target article tries to integrate the proximate,
    developmental models with the ultimate, evolutionary ones. Two
    developmentally different etiologies of sociopathy emerge from two
    different evolutionary mechanisms. Social strategies for minimizing
    the incidence of sociopathic behavior in modern society should
    consider the two different etiologies and the factors which
    contribute to them.

This is to announce a new archive for technical reports for the
Philosophy/Neuroscience/Psychology program at Washington University.
Reports are available in a number of areas of cognitive science and
philosophy of mind.

Reports are stored in various formats -- most are in ASCII or compressed
Postscript.  The former (files with .ascii) can be retrieved and read or
printed directly; the latter (files with .ps.Z) must be retrieved,
uncompressed (with "uncompress <filename>") and printed on a laser printer.
Some papers are stored in both formats for convenience.

To retrieve a report -- e.g., clark.folk-psychology.ascii:

1. ftp thalamus.wustl.edu
2. Login as "anonymous" or "ftp"
3. Password: <your e-mail address>
4. cd pub/pnp/papers
5. get clark.folk-psychology.ascii

An index of papers in the archive so far is included below.  The list
will be expanding frequently; an updated index can be found in the
file INDEX in pub/pnp/papers.

Tail-Recursive Distributed Representations and Simple Recurrent Networks
   Stan C. Kwasny & Barry L. Kalman, Department of Computer Science

Representation poses important challenges to connectionism.  The ability to
structurally compose representations is critical in achieving the capability
considered necessary for cognition.  We provide a technique for mapping any
ordered collection (forest) of hierarchical structures (trees) into a set of
training patterns which can be used effectively in training a simple recurrent
network (SRN) to develop RAAM-style distributed representations.  The
advantages in our technique are three-fold: first, the fixed-valence
restriction on RAAM structures is removed; second, representations correspond
to ordered forests of labeled trees thereby extending what can be represented;
third, training can be accomplished with an auto-associative SRN, making
training much more straightforward.

94-02 kalman.trainrec.ps     

TRAINREC: A System for Training Feedforward & Simple Recurrent Networks
Efficiently and Correctly
   Barry L. Kalman & Stan C. Kwasny, Department	of Computer Science

TRAINREC is a system for training feedforward and recurrent neural networks
that incorporates several ideas.  It uses the more efficient conjugate
gradient method; we derive a new error function with several desirable
properties; we argue for skip (shortcut) connections where appropriate, and
for a sigmoidal yielding values in the [-1,1] interval; we use singular value
decomposition to avoid overanalyzing the input feature space.  We have made an
effort to discover methods that work in both theory and practice, motivated by
considerations ranging from efficiency of training to accuracy of the result.

A Computational Foundation for the Study of Cognition
  David J. Chalmers, Department of Philosophy

Computation is central to the foundations of modern cognitive science, but its
role is controversial.  Questions about computation abound: What is it for a
physical system to implement a computation?  Is computation sufficient for
thought?  What is the role of computation in a theory of cognition?  What is
the relation between different sorts of computational theory, such as
connectionism and symbolic computation?  This article develops a systematic
framework that addresses all of these questions.  A careful analysis of
computation and its relation to cognition suggests that the ambitions of
artificial intelligence and the centrality of computation in cognitive science
are justified.

94-04 chalmers.content.{ps,ascii}

The Components of Content
  David J. Chalmers, Department of Philosophy.

Are the contents of thought in the head of the thinker, in the environment,
or in a combination of the two?  In this paper I develop a two-dimensional
intensional account of content, decomposing a thought's content into its
notional content -- which is internal to the thinker -- and its relational
content.  Notional content is fully semantic, having truth-conditions of its
own; and notional content is what governs the dynamics and rationality of
thought.  I apply this two-dimensional picture to dissolve a number of
problems in the philosophy of mind and language.

94-05 chalmers.bibliography.{intro,1,2,3,4,5}

Contemporary Philosophy of Mind: An Annotated Bibliography
  David J. Chalmers, Department of Philosophy

This is an annotated bibliography of work in the philosophy of mind from the
last thirty years.  There are about 1700 entries, divided into five parts:
(1) Consciousness and Qualia; (2) Mental Content; (3) Psychophysical Relations
and Psychological Explanation; (4) Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence;
(5) Miscellaneous Topics.

94-06 clark.trading-spaces.ascii

Trading Spaces: Computation, Representation, and the Limits of Learning
  Andy Clark (Dept. of Philosophy) and Chris Thornton (U. of Sussex)

We argue that existing learning algorithms are often poorly equipped to solve
problems involving a certain type of (important and widespread) statistical
regularity, which we call `type-2 regularity'. The solution is to trade
achieved representation against computational search. We investigate several
ways in which such a trade-off may be pursued. The upshot is that various
kinds of incremental learning (e.g. Elman 1991) emerge not as peripheral but
as absolutely central and essential features of successful cognition.

94-07 clark.folk-psychology.ascii

Dealing in Futures: Folk Psychology and the Role of Representations in
Cognitive Science.
  Andy Clark, Department of Philosophy.

The paper investigates the Churchlands' long-standing critique of folk
psychology.  I argue that the scientific advances upon which the Churchlands
so ably draw will have their most profound impact NOT upon our assessment of
the folk discourse but upon our conception of the role of representations in
the explanatory projects of cognitive science.  Representation, I suggest,
will indeed be reconceived, somewhat marginalized, and will emerge as at best
one of the objects of cognitive scientific explanation rather than as its
foundation.

94-08 clark.autonomous-agents.ascii

Autonomous Agents and Real-Time Success: Some Foundational Issues.
  Andy Clark, Department of Philosophy

Recent developments in situated robotics and related fields claim to
challenge the pervasive role of internal representations in the production of
intelligent behavior.  Such arguments, I show, are both suggestive and
misguided.  The true lesson, I argue, lies in forcing a much-needed
re-evaluation of the notion of internal representation itself.  The present
paper begins the task of developing such a notion by pursuing two concrete
examples of fully situated yet representation-dependent cognition: animate
vision and motor emulation.

94-09 mccann.gold-market.ps

A Neural Network Model for the Gold Market
  Peter J. McCann and Barry L. Kalman, Department of Computer Science

A neural network trend predictor for the gold bullion market is presented.
A simple recurrent neural network was trained to recognize turning points
in the gold market based on a to-date history of ten market indices.
The network was tested on data that was held back from training, and a
significant amount of predictive power was observed.  The turning point
predictions can be used to time transactions in the gold bullion and gold
mining company stock index markets to obtain a significant paper profit
during the test period.

94-10 chalmers.consciousness.{ps,ascii}

Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness
  David Chalmers, Department of Philosophy

The problems of consciousness fall into two classes: the easy problems and the
hard problems.  The easy problems include reportability, accessibility, the
difference between wakefulness and sleep, and the like; the hard problem is
subjective experience.  Most recent work attacks only the easy problems.  I
illustrate this with a critique, and argue that reductive approaches to the
hard problem must inevitably fail.  I outline a new framework for the
nonreductive explanation of consciousness, in terms of basic principles
connecting physical processes to experience.  Using this framework, I sketch a
candidate theory of conscious experience, revolving around principles of
structural coherence and organizational invariance, and a double-aspect theory
of information.

94-11 chalmers.qualia.{ps,ascii}

Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia
  David Chalmers, Department of Philosophy

In this paper I use thought-experiments to argue that systems with the same
fine-grained functional organization will have the same conscious experiences,
no matter what they are made out of.  These thought-experiments appeal to
scenarios involving gradual replacement of neurons by silicon chips.  I
argue against the "absent qualia" hypothesis by using a "fading qualia"
scnario, and against the "inverted qualia" hypothesis by using a "dancing
qualia" scenario.  The conclusion is that absent qualia and inverted qualia
are logically possible but empirically impossible, leading to a kind of
nonreductive functionalism.

After All
  Morten Christiansen, Department of Philosophy

Language acquisition is often said to require a massive innate body of
language specific knowledge in order to overcome the poverty of the stimulus.
In this picture, language learning merely implies setting a number of
parameters in an internal Universal Grammar.  But is the primary linguistic
evidence really so poor that it warrants such an extreme nativism?  Is there
no room for a more empiricist approach to language acquisition?  In this
paper, I argue against the extreme nativist position, discussing recent
results from psycholinguistics and connectionist research on natural language.

Natural Language Recursion and Recurrent Neural Networks
  Morten Christiansen (Dept. of Philosophy) and Nick Chater (U. of Oxford)

The recursive structure of natural language was one of the principal sources
of difficulty for associationist models of linguistic behaviour.  More
recently, it has become a focus in the debate on neural network models of
language, which many regard as the natural heirs of the associationist legacy.
Can neural networks learn to handle recursive structures?  If not, many would
argue, neural networks can be ruled out as viable models of language
processing.  In this paper, we reconsider the implications of natural language
recursion for neural network models, and present simulations in which
recurrent neural networks are trained on simple recursive structures.  We
suggest implications for theories of human language processing.

Embodied Connectionism
  William Bechtel, Department of Philosophy

Classical approaches to modeling cognition have treated the cognitive system
as disembodied.  This I argue is a consequence of a common strategy of theory
development in which researchers attempt to decompose functions into component
functions and assign these components functions to parts of systems.  But one
might question the decomposition that segregates a cognitive system from its
environment.  I suggest how connectionist modeling may facilitate the
development of cognitive models that do not so isolate cognitive systems from
their environment.  While such an approach may seem natural for lower
cognitive activities, such as navigating an environment, I suggest that the
approach be pursued with higher cognitive functions as well, using natural
deduction as the example.

Consciousness: Perspectives from Symbolic and Connectionist AI
  William Bechtel, Department of Philosophy

While consciousness has not been a major concern of most AI researchers, some
have tried to explore how computational models might explain it.  I explore
how far computational models might go in explaining consciousness, focusing on
three aspects of conscious mental states: their intrinsic intentionality, a
subject's awareness of the contents of these intentional states, and the
distinctive qualitative character of these states.  I describe and evaluate
strategies for developing connectionist systems that satisfy these aspects of
consciousness.  My assessment is that connectionist models can do quite well
with regard to the first two components, but face far greater difficulties in
explaining the qualitative character of conscious states.

What Knowledge Must be in the Head in Order to Acquire Langauge?
  William Bechtel, Department of Philosophy

A common strategy in theorizing about the linguistic capacity has localized it
within the mind of the language user.  A result has been that the mind itself
is often taken to operate according to linguistic principles.  I propose an
approach to modeling linguistic capacity which distributes that capacity over
a cognitive system and external symbols.  This lowers the requirements that
must be satisfied by the cognitive system itself.  For example, productivity
and systematicity might not result from processing characteristics of the
cognitive system, but from the system's interaction with external symbols
which themselves adhere to syntactic principles.  To indicate how a relatively
weak processing system can exhibit linguistic competence, I describe a recent
model by St. John and McClelland.

94-17 bechtel.deduction.ps

Natural Deduction in Connectionist Systems
  William Bechtel, Department of Philosophy

I have argued elsewhere that the systematicity of human thought might be
explained as a result of the fact that we have learned natural languages which
are themselves syntactically structured.  According to this view, linguistic
symbols are external to the cognitive system and what the system must learn to
do is produce and comprehend such symbols.  In this paper I pursue that idea
by arguing that ability in natural deduction itself may rely on pattern
recognition abilities that enable us to operate on external symbols rather
than encodings of rules that might be applied to internal representations.  To
support this suggestion, I present a series of experiments with connectionist
networks that have been trained to construct simple natural deductions in
sentential logic.

The SPP email list has recently gained about 50 new names, due to
a heroic effort by John Bickle, the new secretary/treasurer. As
this occurs, there will undoubtedly be a few glitches as novitiates
learn the difference between SPP and SPP-REQUEST as email addresses.

This difference is always contained in the TOP PORTION of each
broadcast spp message (such as this one), as a reminder anytime
you wish to send a message either to the ENTIRE LIST MEMBERSHIP:

		SPP@UMIACS.UMD.EDU

or to the LIST MANAGER ALONE:

		SPP-REQUEST@UMIACS.UMD.EDU

The latter is obviously the right choice for requests to add or
delete names, make complaints, etc. 

Again, you do not need to remember this. Just look at the top of
any recent spp message and you will see the distinction spelled
out.

If someone does make an error and sends to everyone (i.e., to spp@umiacs)
a message much better sent only to spp-request, please do NOT respond 
angrily with a reply to everyone, thereby compounding the problem. This
happened a few years ago and soon the cyberspace was filled with more 
and more lemmings rushing to the sea... Better to stay calm and send a 
message to the manager (spp-request@umiacs.umd.edu) alone.

The class of messages appropriate for general broadcast (spp@umiacs.umd.edu)
includes announcements of meetings, summer courses, bibliographies, queries,
and so on, i.e., matters of potential general interest for people in the
various allied cognitive sciences.

    ABSTRACT: This book argues that (1) AI will continue to produce
    machines with the capacity to pass stronger and stronger versions
    of the Turing Test but that (2) the "Person Building Project" (the
    attempt by AI and Cognitive Science to build a machine which is a
    person) will inevitably fail. The defense of (2) rests in large
    part on a refutation of the proposition that persons are automata
    -- a refutation involving an array of issues, from free will to
    Godel to introspection to Searle and beyond. The defense of (1)
    brings the reader face to face with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
    as they tackle perhaps their toughest case (Silver Blaze); the
    upshot of this visit with Conan Doyle's duo is an algorithm-sketch
    for solving murder mysteries. The author's mechanical approach to
    writing fiction and the philosophical side of computerized story
    generation are also discussed.

    KEYWORDS: behaviorism, Chinese Room Argument, cognition,
    consciousness, finite automata, free will, functionalism,
    introspection, mind, story generation, Turing machines, Turing
    Test.

I. CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

I.1 THE GENERAL POSITION

1. My book (Bringsjord 1992a) argues that Artificial Intelligence will
eventually produce robots (or androids) whose behavior is dazzling, but
it will not produce robotic persons. Robots will DO a lot, but they
won't BE a lot. The reader is asked to evaluate this claim on the
basis of my defense of this position (and other arguments in the
literature), rather than on the basis of slippery metadisputes about
whether or not my position and arguments for it are prima facie
plausible.

2. My position accords well with the decline of behaviorism, and
specifically the apparent decline of the behavioristic Turing Test (see
Rey, 1986) and any number of the Turing-like Tests proposed in the
literature [NOTE #1]. Readers familiar only with Turing's original test
(Turing, 1964), and not with the variations that have been derived from
it, should imagine now an ever more stringent sequence of Turing-like
tests T1, T2, T3,..., the first member of which is the original
imitation game. How does the sequence arise? In T2 we might allow the
judge to observe the physical appearance of the contestants; in T3 we
might allow the judge to make requests concerning the sensorimotor
behavior of the contestants; in T4 we might allow the judge to take
skin samples; in T5 we might allow the judge to run brain scans, then
surgical probing, and so on. The point is that we can pretty much rest
assured that AI will gradually climb up the sequence; that soon we'll
have T.75, eventually T1 (though probably not by 2000 as Turing had
predicted), etc. I hold that robots will pass, if not all, then at
least a goodly number of tests in the Turing Test sequence, but they
will always lack some of the properties claimed, in "What Robots Can
and Can't Be" (henceforth, ROBOTS), to be necessary for personhood. I
defend this position with precise deductive arguments which (in my
opinion) sometimes border on proofs.

I.2 THE TARGET

3. What group of people, what field or discipline, aims at bringing us
these powerful robots? Candidate terms abound: "Strong" AI (Searle,
1980), GOFAI, or Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (Haugeland,
1986), "Old Hand" AI (Doyle, 1988), "Person Building" AI (Charniak &
McDermott, 1985; Pollock, 1989), etc. All these AI researchers envision
the building of an "intelligent robot," one who excels in the Turing
Test sequence, able not only to checkmate you, but to debate you. If
such a vision will sooner or later come to pass, as I'm quite sure it
will, then, again, a question worth asking now is: will robots, in the
coming age in which they excel in the Turing Test sequence, be
persons?

4. Let us call the AI/Cog-Sci project to build a person the "Person
Building Project." PBP will denote the proposition that the Person
Building Project will succeed. This project has flesh-and-blood
proponents, optimistic ones. For example, according to Charniak and
McDermott (1985, p. 7), "The ultimate goal of AI research (which we are
very far from achieving) is to build a person, or more humbly, an
animal." Some of the arguments in ROBOTS, if sound, could, with minor
modification, refute Charniak and McDermott's thesis that AI can
succeed in building a sophisticated animal. But what I wish to attack
directly is the heart of the Person Building Project: the proposition
that persons are automata.

5. Here, in a nutshell, is why I think the Person Building Project
will fail. (The symbol -> stands for material implication; ~ stands for
truth-functional negation):

    (1)  PBP -> Persons are automata.  
    
    (2)  ~ Persons are automata.

Therefore:

    (3)  ~ PBP.

6. This is a formally valid argument: simple modus tollens. Premise
(2) is repeatedly established in ROBOTS through instantiations of a
simple schema, viz,

    (4)  Persons have F.

    (5)  Automata can't have F.

Therefore:

    (6)  Persons can't be automata.

In the book, F stands for such things as free will, the ability to
infallibly introspect (over a narrow range of properties), an inner
"what it's like to be" experience, etc.

7. Why is (1) true? Those engaged in the Person Building Project are
committed to certain well-defined algorithmic techniques which, though
hard to enumerate precisely, are used when you construct and program a
high-speed computer with sensors and effectors. If someone managed to
build a person by stirring up some fertile biological soup in the right
way, or by somehow compressing all of evolution into a second of
development that could be magically applied to a single-cell creature,
this would not spell success for the person builders I have in mind. To
affirm PBP is to hold that certain computer techniques will produce
people. Nor is the idea that by using these techniques you'll get lucky
and bring a person into existence through a side-effect of what you've
done. There are those whose ultimate aim is this side-effect --
thinkers who hope to build a computational device whose structure is
appropriate for "ensoulment," a device alongside which a person, an
immaterial entity, will pop into existence and connect up with the
device in some way (e.g., see Turkle, 1984). These thinkers aren't my
concern herein. I'm concerned with those who think AI techniques are
near the essence of personhood, or mindedness (or mentality, mentation,
cognition) itself.

8. For such cognitive engineers, the success of their techniques won't
show that people are, essentially and in general, the particular
computers they are working on. If a team of cognitive engineers
succeeded beyond their wildest dreams and happened to do so by
programming a Cray 4, they would not be entitled to hold that persons
are Cray 4s. There is no reason to think that the specific physical
material (the particular computer and peripheral components)
constituting the robots produced by the Person Building Project will be
essential. Human persons happen to be made of flesh, not silicon; AI
(unlike, say, neurophysiology) does not work with flesh. So behind PBP
is "AI-Functionalism," according to which people are idealized
computers. This intuition is, as Haugeland (1986) has suggested,
captured elegantly by "Persons are automata," or at least by something
very close to it.

II. CHAPTER 2: OUR MACHINERY

9. Chapter 2 contains the rough-and-ready ontology presupposed
throughout the book, and an account of the logico-mathematical language
used. It also characterizes personhood on the basis of some crucial
prephilosophical data and gives definitions of finite automata, Turing
machines, and cellular automata. Using these definitions, I clarify
"Persons are automata," and distinguish between the different versions
of this proposition that arise when one specifies the automaton in
question. I also say a little about Church's Thesis and, via the "Busy
Beaver" function and the Halting Problem, about uncomputability (see
also Bringsjord 1993a,b; Bringsjord & Zenzen, forthcoming).

III. CHAPTER 3: ARGUMENTS PRO, DESTROYED

10. Chapter 3 presents refutations of five arguments for the view that
persons are automata: the Argument from Analogy (Nelson, 1982), the
Argument from What Should Remain Unexplained (Dennett, 1976), the
Argument from Natural Functions (Burks, 1973), the How to Build a
Person Argument (Pollock, 1989), and the Pretty Much What Everyone
Believes Argument (Cole, personal communication).

11. Cole summarizes his argument as follows:

    I suppose that many like myself who believe that persons are
    automata suppose this because we see that neurons appear to be
    finite probabilistic automata, that is to say they have computable
    transfer functions.  From there we note that brains are composed
    merely of neurons (neural nets), along with some supporting
    structures, glial cells, etc., and that brains produce mentality.
    (ROBOTS, P. 126)

12. I show that this argument, tempting though it is, is ultimately
untenable. If one assumes agent materialism and jumps beyond what we
know to be the case (that brains, with supporting structures, produce
mentality), to what many suspect is the case (that brains, with
supporting structures, are persons), then Cole's argument does work --
but such a strategy would need independent defense (Pollock 1989).

13. Overall, Cole seems to vote "yes" on all six components of the
Contemporary Cognitive Sextet:

    (C1) Token Physicalism,
    (C2) Agent Materialism,
    (C3) Functionalism,
    (C4) Persons are Automata,
    (C5) Person Building will succeed,
    (C6) Robot Building will succeed.

My own vote on each, supported by the arguments in the book, would be:

    (C1) Maybe
    (C2) Maybe
    (C3) No
    (C4) No
    (C5) No
    (C6) Yes

IV. CHAPTER 4: WHAT ROBOTS CAN BE

14. The 4th chapter provides some evidence that robots will ascend
the Turing Test sequence. Two questions are addressed: (1) Are
mysteries of the sort solved by Sherlock Holmes solvable by an expert
system of the future? (2) Is it possible to get a computer to write
sophisticated fiction? I argue that both these questions should be
answered in the affirmative; my argument provides reason for optimism
concerning the powers of future robots. Why address mystery-solving?
It's one of the few concrete human abilities that a philosopher
(Manning, 1987) has argued cannot be matched by a machine. And
computer-generated fiction is my own area of research in Cognitive
Engineering (Bringsjord 1992b). The rest of ROBOTS consists of a series
of deductive arguments against the Person Building Project.

V. CHAPTER 5: SEARLE

16. My Searlean (Chinese Room) attack on person-building is based on
Jonah, an imaginary mono savant. Jonah is blessed with the following
powers. He can -- automatically, swiftly, without conscious
deliberation -- reduce high-level computer programs (in, say, PROLOG
and LISP) to the super-austere language that drives a Register machine
(or Turing machine). Once he has carried out this reduction, he can use
his incredible powers of mental imagery to visualize a Register
machine, and to visualize this machine running the program that results
from his reduction. So if you give Jonah a LISP program, he translates
it into a Register program, without giving any thought whatever to the
MEANING of the LISP program. Jonah, in some attenuated sense, knows
the syntax of LISP, but he doesn't have any semantics for the language.
He doesn't know, for example, that (DEFUN ...) is a string that defines
a function; he doesn't even know that (+ ...) is a built-in function
for addition. He DOES know, however, how to "run" his visualized
Register machine given a Register program and data put into the first
register R0. Jonah is also capable of taking input through his senses
and translating it into input to his visualized machine [NOTE #2].

17. It should be obvious how Jonah gives rise to a Chinese Room-like
situation. Suppose it's 2040, and that person-builders have produced
robots which they herald as persons. Since one of the hallmarks of
persons is that they can converse in and understand natural languages,
the person-builders will claim that their robots can do the same. If
these robots converse in and understand some natural language L, it
should be a trivial matter to get them to speak and understand
Chinese. So, here we are in 2040: some no doubt super-long computer
program P enables robots to speak and understand Chinese. And here is
how Jonah enters the picture. We simply give him P, ask him to reduce P
to a Register program P', and then ask him to run P' on his visualized
Register machines in such a way that input we give him on index cards
(strings in Chinese) goes into register R0; and the output, after
processing, comes back into R0, whereupon Jonah spits back this output,
writing it down for us on an index card. Jonah does not himself speak a
word of Chinese.

18. The argument then runs as follows. It appears that Person-Building
AI/Cog Sci is committed to

    (7) If the Person Building Project will succeed, then there is a
	computer program P such that when P runs on a computer M there
	is a person s associated with M who understands Chinese.

And

    (8) If there is a computer program P such that when P runs on a
	computer M there is a person s associated with M who
	understands Chinese, then if Jonah reduces P to P' and runs P'
	Jonah understands Chinese.

But

    (9) It's not the case that if Jonah runs P' Jonah understands
        Chinese.

19. Hence, by hypothetical syllogism and modus tollens it follows from
these three propositions that the Person Building Project won't
succeed. Proposition (9) is not to be viewed as a premise, but rather
as an intermediate conclusion following (by elementary logic) from the
following three propositions.

    (L*) If an agent s understands two natural languages L0 and L1, then
         s can (perhaps only after considerable effort that produces a
	 long-winded translation) translate between L0 and L1.

    (10) Jonah (by hypothesis) understands English.

    (11) Jonah CAN'T translate between English and Chinese.

20. Three objections to Searlean arguments appear to be the most up-to-
date and promising, one from Churchland & Churchland (1990; cf. Searle
1990), and two rather more subtle ones, one from Cole, and one
from Rapaport (personal communication). I rebut all three.

VI. CHAPTER 6: ARBITRARY REALIZATION

21. We start with what should be an uncontroversial conditional,
namely,

        If the Person Building Project will succeed, then AI-
        Functionalism is true.

Now, assume that person-builders will manage to build robotic persons.
By modus ponens, then, we of course have AI-Functionalism, the "flow
chart" version (Dennett, 1978) of which is

    (AI-F) For every two "brains" x and y, possibly constituted by
	   radically different physical stuff, if the overall flow of
	   information in x and y, represented as a pair of flow charts
	   (or a pair of Turing machines, or a pair of Turing machine
	   diagrams,...), is the same, then if "associated" with x
	   there is an agent s in mental state S, there is an agent s'
	   associated with or constituted by y which is also in S.

22. Now let 'B' denote the brain of some person s
and let s be in the mental state FEARING PURPLE UNICORNS. Now
imagine that a Turing machine M, representing exactly the same flow
chart as that which governs B, is built out of 4 billion Norwegians all
working on railroad tracks in boxcars with chalk and erasers (etc.)
across the state of Texas. From this hypothesis and (AI-F), it follows
that there is some agent m constituted by M which also fears purple
unicorns. But it seems intuitively obvious that

        There is no agent m constituted by M that fears purple
        unicorns.

We've reached a contradiction. Hence our original assumption, that the
Person Building Project will succeed, is wrong. I consider and rebut
the best objections I know of to this reasoning.

VII. CHAPTER 7: GODEL

23. The 7th chapter is an argument that Godelian incompleteness at
least threatens the thesis that persons are automata. Godelian attacks
on such theses are not new, but they are currently thought by most
philosophers and AI researchers to be unsound, perhaps even rather
silly. I try to resurrect the Godelian case. Without claiming it is
demonstrative, I do try to show that, contrary to current opinion, it
should be taken seriously. Lack of space precludes encapsulating the
relevant arguments here.

24. The book ends with two arguments without precedent in the
literature, one concerning free will and the other concerning
introspection.

VIII. CHAPTER 8: FREE WILL

25. Chapter 8 is a rigorous reconstruction of the extremely vague
argument that people can't be machines because people enjoy autonomy,
while the behavior of machines is causally predetermined by their
programs operating in conjunction with laws of nature. The
reconstruction hinges on the proposition, defended in the chapter, that
people enjoy what I call 'iterative agent causation,' the view
that people can directly bring about certain of their own
mental events (e.g., decisions), AND bring about the bringing about of
these events, ad infinitum. The reasoning is as follows:

    (12) If determinism, the view that all events are causally
	 necessitated, is true, then no one ever has power over any
	 state of affairs.

    (13) If indeterminism, the view that determinism is false, is true,
	 then, unless people enjoy iterative agent causation, no one
	 ever has power over any state of affairs.

    (14) Either determinism or indeterminism is true (a tautology).

Therefore:

    (15) Unless iterative agent causation is true, no one ever has power
	 over any state of affairs. [from (12)-(14)]

    (16) If no one ever has power over any state of affairs, then no one
	 is ever morally responsible for anything that happens.

    (17) Someone is morally responsible for something that happens.

Therefore:

    (18) It's not the case that no one ever has power over any state of
         affairs. [from (16), (17)]

Therefore:

   (19) Iterative agent causation is true. [from (18), (15)]

   (20) If iterative agent causation is true, then people aren't
        automata.

Therefore:

   (21) People aren't automata. [from (8), (9)]

The chapter includes a defense of all the premises in this argument.

IX. CHAPTER 9: INTROSPECTION

26. Chapter 9 revolves around what I call 'hyper-weak incorrigibilism,'
the view that humans have, WITH RESPECT TO A RESTRICTED CLASS OF MENTAL
PROPERTIES, the ability to ascertain infallibly, via introspection,
whether they have these properties. Here is how the first version of
the argument, which is aimed at a symbolicist version of the Person
Building Project, runs. Suppose that this project will succeed; then it
would seem that three things are true of the robots that will be the
crowning achievement of this project:

    (22) If there is some significant mental property that persons have,
	 these robots must also have this property;

    (23) The objects of these robots' "beliefs" (hopes, fears, etc.)
	 -- the objects of their propositional attitudes  -- are
	 represented by formulas of some symbol system, and these
	 formulas will be present in these robots' knowledge bases;

    (24) These robots will be physical instantiations of automata
	 (the physical substrate of which will be something like
	 current silicon hardware, but may be something as extravagant
	 as optically based parallel hardware).

27. It follows from the doctrine of hyper-weak incorrigibilism and (22)
that the powerful robot (call it 'r') eventually to be produced by
Strong AI/Cog Sci will be able to introspect infallibly with respect to
a certain privileged set of mental properties C'. That is, it follows
that the relevant instantiation of hyper-weak incorrigibilism is the
case, viz,

    (25) For every property F, if it's a member of C', then it is
	 necessarily true that: if r believes r has F, r does indeed
	 have F.

But now in light of (23) it follows that (25) implies that

    (26) For every property F, if it is a member of C', then,
	 necessarily: if the formula corresponding to r's belief
	 that r has F is an element of r's knowledge base, then
	 r does indeed have F.

28. Let's suppose, then, that we have in the picture, along with our
robot r, a certain particular property from C', say the property
SEEMING TO BE IN PAIN, a property we'll designate 'F*'. It follows that

    (27) It is logically necessary that: if the formula corresponding to
	 r's belief that r has F* is in r's knowledge base, then r does
	 indeed have F*.

29. Now, having arrived at this point, let's turn to a simple and well-
known fact about hardware (ANY hardware), namely, that it is physically
possible (that is, not contrary to the laws of physics) that hardware
fails. Accordingly, it is physically possible that the substrate of r
fails, and since, in turn, it is physically possible that this failure is
the cause of the fact that the formula in question (the formula
corresponding to r's belief that r has F*) is in r's knowledge base:

    (28) It is logically possible that the formula in question is in r's
	 knowledge base while r does NOT have F*.

30. But (27) and (28), by an elementary law of modal logic (in a word:
if it's logically necessary that if P then Q, then it's not logically
possible that P while not-Q) form a contradiction. Hence, by indirect
proof, our original assumption, that symbolicist Person Building will
succeed, is wrong. I go on to consider and refute a number of
objections to this line of reasoning, including one that is likely to
come from connectionists.

X. CHAPTER 10: CONCLUSION

31. The final chapter offers a retrospective view of the colorful
thought-experimental characters visited along the journey and makes
some brief concluding remarks about the overall case for the view that
robots will largely do what we do, but won't be one of us.

XI. ERRATA

42. I have assembled a list of typos and so on (e.g., p. 19's list is in
error: the first two conditionals are supposed to be prefixed by
necessity operators, and the S5 derivability claim in line 9 should
have its schematic conditional necessitated; Harnad (1991) was
inadvertently omitted from the bibliography, etc.), but I should inform
my critics that none of these glitches seems to spell genuine trouble
for the arguments at the heart of the book. If any of my arguments
fail, I'm afraid it will be due to deeper defects.

NOTES

#1. For a lucid discussion of the Turing Test, the Total Turing Test, and
the Total Total Turing Test, see (Harnad, 1991). For an argument that
even more stringent tests, mathematically speaking, than those
considered by Harnad cannot separate the "thinkers" from the
"pretenders," see Bringsjord (1994).

#2 For a fascinating account of a real-life idiot savant reminiscent of
Jonah, see the case of Christopher, in Blakelee (1991).

        PSYCOLOQUY Book Review Instructions

The PSYCOLOQUY book review procedure is very similar to the commentary
procedure except that it is the book itself, not a target article, that
is under review. (The Precis summarizing the book is intended to permit
PSYCOLOQUY readers who have not read the book to assess the exchange,
but the reviews should address the book, not primarily the Precis.)

Note that as multiple reviews will be co-appearing, you need only
comment on the aspects of the book relevant to your own specialty and
interests, not necessarily the book in its entirety. Any substantive
comments and criticism -- including points calling for a detailed and
substantive response from the author -- are appropriate. Hence,
investigators who have already reviewed or intend to review this book
elsewhere are still encouraged to submit a PSYCOLOQUY review specifically
written with this specialized multilateral review-and-response feature
in mind.

1.  Before preparing your review, please read carefully
    the Instructions for Authors and Commentators and examine
    recent numbers of PSYCOLOQUY.

2.  Reviews should not exceed 500 lines. Where judged necessary
    by the Editor, reviews will be formally refereed.

3.  Please provide a title for your review. As many
    commentators will address the same general topic, your
    title should be a distinctive one that reflects the gist
    of your specific contribution and is suitable for the
    kind of keyword indexing used in modern bibliographic
    retrieval systems. Each review should also have a brief
    (~50-60 word) Abstract

4.  All paragraphs should be numbered consecutively. Line length
    should not exceed 72 characters.  The review should begin with
    the title, your name and full institutional address (including zip
    code) and email address.  References must be prepared in accordance
    with the examples given in the Instructions.  Please read the
    sections of the Instruction for Authors concerning style,

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR PSYCOLOQUY AUTHORS AND COMMENTATORS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 40,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral science, cognitive science,
neuroscience, social science, etc.). All contributions are refereed.

Target article length should normally not exceed 500 lines [c. 4500 words].
Commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines [c. 1800 words].

All target articles, commentaries and responses must have (1) a short
abstract (up to 100 words for target articles, shorter for commentaries
and responses), (2) an indexable title, (3) the authors' full name(s)
and institutional address(es).

In addition, for target articles only: (4) 6-8 indexable keywords,
(5) a separate statement of the authors' rationale for soliciting
commentary (e.g., why would commentary be useful and of interest to the
field? what kind of commentary do you expect to elicit?) and
(6) a list of potential commentators (with their email addresses).

All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries and
responses (see format of already published articles in the PSYCOLOQUY
archive; line length should be < 80 characters, no hyphenation).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

			POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AVAILABLE

The DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (St. Louis) is
accepting applications for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship for the 1995-1996
academic year in the Department's graduate program in
Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP).  The Department' s PNP program
is presently staffed by nine permanent faculty from philosophy, numerous
permanent faculty from other Washington University departments and
schools, and two Post-doctoral Fellows.  The program is particularly
interested in someone with backg round in connectionist or neural network
modeling or in understanding processes of scientific discovery, although
other specializations within the scope of PNP will be considered. 
Applicants for the 1995-1996 Fellowship must have their Ph.D. in hand by t
he time the Fellowship connences and have received their Ph.D. (or
equivalent degree) no EARLIER than 1993.  The advanced degree need not be
in philosophy, but the successful applicant will be expected to teach one
PNP-related course per year, present two or three public lectures, and
carry our independent research in residence.  The Fellowship carries a
stipend of $32,000.  (It is possible, even likely, that the fellowship
could be renewed for a second year, 1996-1997.) Interested applicants
should send a curriculum vitae listing at least three references and a short
statement of teaching and research interests by DECEMBER 1, 1994 to
Professor William Bechtel, Department of Philosophy, Campus Box 1073,
Washington University in St. Louis, One Brookings D rive, St. Louis, MO

I thought some subscribers to this list might be interested in the following
project. Please contact me if interested in hearing more or getting copies of
the papers. I'd be especially interested in hearing about related projects
elsewhere.



ABSTRACT 

The project is within the area of Artificial Intelligence.  It is on the
question of how mental states (such as states of believing, thinking,
intending, hoping, etc.) are described or implicitly conveyed in natural
language discourse, and how this issue interacts with the discernment of
discourse coherence.  Mental states of agents mentioned in a discourse are
often conveyed by metaphorical statements. A wide variety of metaphors of mind
are used for this purpose. For instance, the mind is often likened to a
physical region, with ideas or mental events having particular locations within
the region. When a mental state is portrayed metaphorically, that fact often
has major implications for question of coherence with other statements in the
discourse.  In particular, if the state is a believing, the metaphorical
portrayal can affect the understander's assessment of whether the believing
agent inferentially combines that belief with other beliefs that are described
or implied by the discourse. The issue of evaluating whether an agent performs
such mental acts is part of a long-standing problem for the study of mental
states (in artificial intelligence, philosophy, etc.).  The role of metaphor in
illuminating such issues had not previously been addressed in computational
detail.  The project has led to a prototype implemented AI system, ATT-Meta,
that processes metaphorical descriptions of mental states, discerns some of
their implications, and seeks a type of discourse coherence between the
descriptions and the surrounding discourse.

                        Call for Applications

                       GENEVA EMOTION WEEK '95

                      April 8 to April 13, 1995
                   University of Geneva, Switzerland

The Emotion Research Group at the University of Geneva announces the
third GENEVA EMOTION WEEK (GEW '95), consisting of a colloquium focusing
on a major topic in the psychology of emotion, and of a series of
workshops designed to introduce participants to advanced research
methods in the field of emotion.

The colloquium consists of extensive presentations of theoretical and
methodological approaches as well as recent empirical work by a group of
invited speakers and faculty members of the University of Geneva. Ample
time is allotted for discussion. The colloquium lasts 3 days. The theme
chosen for the GEW '95 is:

                         Artificial Emotions

The intention of  GEW'95 is to bring together researchers in  diverse
disciplines, including AI, neurosciences, philosophy, and psychology,
who share an interest in architectures and mechanisms underlying
emotion, motivation, and intelligence. The focus is on architectural
requirements for an autonomous agent, combining the various sub-
functions and sub-mechanisms normally studied separately in AI and
Psychology. GEW'95 is organized in collaboration with the Cognition
and Affect Group under the direction of Prof. Aaron Sloman at the
Cognitive Science Research Center, University of Birmingham.
This group organized the first Workshop on Architectures for
Understanding Motivation and Emotions (WAUME93) at Birmingham
and is pleased that WAUME95 is to be merged with GEW'95.

Speakers and Topics of the colloquium:
--------------------------------------

Prof. Joseph Le Doux, New York University: 
-  Neural Computation of Emotional Meaning by the Brain.

Prof. Stevan Harnad, University of Southampton: 
-  Measuring and Modelling Performance Capacities and 
   Qualitative States.

Prof. Aaron Sloman, University of Birmingham: 
-  Architectures for Emotional Agents.

Prof. Klaus Scherer, University of  Geneva: 
-  Computer Modeling of Appraisal Processes.

Discussant: Prof. Nico Frijda, Univ. Amsterdam

The  workshops will  be dedicated to practical work,  e.g. simulation
models, tools, problems, etc. The workshops listed below will be held by
the  organizers  and  the  invited speakers.  In addition,  2 or 3 workshop
proposals from participants for workshops lasting between 1.5  and
3  hours will be selected on a competitive basis. At the  end  of  each
workshop  day  there  will  be  a  session  (3  x  2h)  for  posters,
demonstrations, videos, and individual discussions.

The topics of the invited workshops, each lasting approx. 3 hours are:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dr. Jorge Armony, Center for Neuroscience, New York:
-  An Anatomically Constrained Connectionist Model of Fear Conditioning.

Prof. Stevan Harnad, Southampton:
- Turing Testing and the Causal Status of Affect. 

Prof. Aaron Sloman, Cognition and Affect Group, Birmingham:
-  Exploring Motivated Agent Design.

Dr. Prem Kalra, Prof. Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, Miralab, Geneva:
- Simulating Facial Expressions and Phonemes for Virtual Humans.

Dr. Thomas Wehrle, Prof. Klaus Scherer, Emotion Research Group, Geneva:

                        THEME OF COLLOQUIUM

The modeling of mental processes in the various human cognitive
activities has generated increasing interest in the scientific world
today. Cognitive models, cognitive simulations, auto-organization,
adaptation, emergence, genetic selection, Darwinian mentalism and
enaction are active research topics in neurological and psychological
theory.

The cognitive sciences offer a continuum of research extending from the
engineering sciences to the philosophy of mind, including the
neurosciences, cognitive psychology, linguistics, semantics, semiotics
and artificial intelligence. Three subconferences will organize
themselves around the following major complementary themes: (i)
Modeling (cognitive and brain functions), (ii) Philosophy of Mind and
Epistemology, and (iii) Applications (AI, technical and computational
engineering).

(i) Modeling is a point of intersection for all these specialties
because it includes the modeling of functions and dysfunctions of the
central nervous system, the neurocomputer sciences, the modeling of
psychocognitive and mental processes, the emergence of intentional
structure on the basis of biological structure, enaction, genetic
algorithms, neural networks, artificial "life," etc.

(ii) The philosophical and epistemological subcomponent poses questions
like the following:  Can we elaborate mathematical models of the mind
and use them to describe and explain human behavior? Are we aiming
toward a mathematical model of the mind? Can we capture the formal
principles of the development and emergence of cognition? Can we
technologically recreate thought? Is the computational symbolic
paradigm, which has imposed itself for the last decades, still a
powerful conceptual tool or is it proving too reductionistic and if so,
how? What is the epistemological status of, for example, the
alternative proposed by the parallel distributed model to the
computational models of classical cognitivism? Wich relations can be
established between the modeling activity of the cognitive and
neurosciences and human experience? 

(iii) The applications subconference will consider practical domains in
which scientific results have been applied in the treatment of
language, the automated cognitive analyses of textual documents (an
intersection of linguistics, semantics, semiotics and artificial
intelligence), aids to decision making, applications in sensory
information processing, etc.

             CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT and REGISTRATION INFORMATION 

                         "Conference On ATTENTION"

             8th Annual Vancouver Cognitive Science Conference

                      February 10-11 (Fri-Sat) 1995
                 Simon Fraser University at Harbour Centre
                    Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada


Attention is a foundational concept in cognitive science.  It played a central
role in the "cognitive revolution" of the 1950s and 1960s and definite progress
has been made recently in the investigation of its underlying processes.
Interest in attentional processes has grown rapidly over the past 15 years and
articles on this topic are prevalent in major journals.  It is an area of
research that has truly come into its own, and has ramifications for work
conducted in the fields of cognitive, perceptual, developmental, clinical, and
physiological psychology, audiology, kinesiology, visual sciences, computer
science, and human factors.  Attention research carried out within several
different experimental paradigms has even progressed to the point where
conclusions can be made about physiological mechanisms.  One of the primary
goals of the conference is to stimulate a discussion among leading researchers
from different disciplines about these findings and perhaps serve as a catalyst
for further insights about the nature of attention.


TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED:
       Attention from an Historical Perspective
       Preattentive and Attentive Mechanisms
       Inattention and the Perception of Objects
       The Development of Attention
       Attention and Inhibition-of-return of Visual Processing
       Visual Attention and Eye Movements
       Physiological and Computational Models of Attention

===============================================================================
TRANSPORTATION

To get from the airport to downtown, there are three main options:
1)  Take a black top cab.  The most expensive option (along with taking a 
limo).  Cost, depending on traffic, is $20-$30.  A tip of %10-15, depending on 
service, is customary.

2)  Take the Airporter/Teal green bus service to downtown Vancouver.  Buses are
waiting outside the airport building at level one.  Cost is $9 one way or $15
round trip.  The bus stops at many downtown Vancouver locations, including the
major hotels.

3)  Take BC Transit buses.  The cheapest option.  The bus trip should take 
40-45 minutes, depending on traffic.  Cost is $1.50 or $2.25 in rush hour.  
You'll need to have the exact change with you.  From the airport, take the 100 
bus to 70th Avenue and then take the 20 bus along Granville which goes
all the way downtown.

                THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
                A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL CONJECTURE

    ABSTRACT: Drawing on previous models of anxiety, intermediate
    memory, the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and goal-directed
    behaviour, a neuropsychological hypothesis is proposed for the
    generation of the contents of consciousness. It is suggested that
    these correspond to the outputs of a comparator that, on a
    moment-by-moment basis, compares the current state of the
    organism's perceptual world with a predicted state. An outline is
    given of the information-processing functions of the comparator
    system and of the neural systems which mediate them.  The
    hypothesis appears to be able to account for a number of key
    features of the contents of consciousness. However, it is argued
    that neither this nor any existing comparable hypothesis is yet
    able to explain why the brain should generate conscious experience
    of any kind at all.

    KEYWORDS: Conciousness, contents of consciousness, comparator,
    septohippocampal system, anxiety, schizophrenia.

other of them, send the following one line message:

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in
the form of a series of lines in an email message that ftpmail or
bitftp will then execute for you).

JANET users without ftp can instead utilise the file transfer facilities
at sites uk.ac.ft-relay or uk.ac.nsf.sun.  Full details are available on
request.

===================================
N e w s   f r o m   t h e   I P P E
===================================  6 Nov 1994

-----------------------------------
World Wide Web access now available
----------------------------------- Access to the preprints and all
other materials in the International Philosophical Preprint Exchange's
collection, including the abstracts and tables of contents of an
increasing number of philosophical journals, is now available via Mosaic
and the World Wide Web.

Our WWW server is still under development and is changing rapidly, and
at the moment there are still several rough spots, but access to all the
IPPE materials is in place.  Due to the rich interface provided by the
Web, browsing the IPPE via Mosaic (or any other Web browser) is now the
preferred access method.  Mosaic and other Web browsers allow easy
access to the multiple formats in which the IPPE stores each paper,
allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ASCII version of a
paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version.  In
addition, we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical
map of the IPPE (not to mention the attractive new graphical IPPE logo).

In addition, much of the IPPE's structure, and many of our informational
documents, are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext
capabilities of the Web.  Expect further announcements soon.

In NCSA Mosaic, Netscape, lynx, or your WWW browser of choice, open the
URL http://phil-preprints.L.chiba-u.ac.jp/IPPE.html to pay us a visit.


-------------------
New journals online
------------------- Since the last "News from the IPPE" in July, several
more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts,
tables of contents, and in some cases selected full-text articles
available online.  Recent additions include Ethics and the Journal of
the History of Philosophy, and arrangements are currently being made
with five other journals, bringing the total number of journals
available or soon to be available through the IPPE to over a dozen.  We
invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given
below.


--------------------
Call for submissions
-------------------- The IPPE invites the submission of working papers
in all areas of philosophy.  Submissions undergo an informal process of
"minimal refereeing" by the IPPE's international board to ensure that
they are of contemporary philosophical interest, but need not be in
fully publishable condition as they stand.  Due to the flexibility of
our electronic media, no length limits apply.

The IPPE's large collection of working papers is currently being visited
by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month, providing
the widest possible exposure for works in progress.  Authors benefit
from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide.  Many authors have
received incisive commentaries and forged important international
connectins with workers in their areas, and the exposure produced by
placing a paper on the IPPE has also in a number of cases yielded
tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of
publication.

Copyright to a paper placed on the the IPPE remains with the author, and
therefore placing a paper on the IPPE is no obstacle to subsequent
publication.  Placing a working draft on the IPPE provides an ideal way
to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical
community before submitting a work for publication.


---------------------
Call for commentaries
--------------------- The IPPE invites the submission of well-reasoned
commentaries on any working paper currently available on the IPPE.
Commentaries are subject to the same "minimal refereeing" process
described above for working papers.  Accepted commentaries are made
available on the IPPE alongside the original papers to which they apply,
and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar
form.


--------------------------------------
IPPE represented at PSA/4S/HSA meeting
-------------------------------------- The Round Table on Electronic
Communications at October's joint meeting of the PSA, 4S, and HSA
provided an opportunity for members of the IPPE's Board to meet with
representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media
for philosophy and science studies.  Among the topics discussed were
means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic
communications resources, and especially to the submission of materials,
and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic
publishers in these fields.  Much was accomplished, and even greater
possibilities lie ahead.


---------------------------
Renovations nearly complete 
--------------------------- The International Philosophical Preprint
Exchange's ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the
preprints and other documents on the IPPE to be distributed
simultaneously by means of the World Wide Web in addition to the
previously implemented Gopher, ftp, and mail-server access methods is
nearly complete.  The customized software we have developed for this
purpose allows the IPPE staff to easily make a single copy of a working
paper available through all four of our supported access methods.

STEPHEN R. ANDERSON

          Professor and Chair of Cognitive Science (Leave of Absence 1994-95)
          Ph.D., Linguistics and Philosophy, MIT, 1969 

Research  General and computational linguistics, phonetics, phonology, 
   Areas  morphology. 

Research  I am a general linguist whose research has included work 
 Summary  in most of the core areas of linguistic theory (phonetics, 
	  phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) as well as
	  historical linguistics, the history of linguistics itself,
	  and the descriptive study of a number of exotic languages
	  (Icelandic, Faroese, Georgian, Breton, and Kwakw'ala, among
	  others). My work was originally focused on questions of
	  phonological theory.  In recent years, I have devoted most of
	  my efforts to the development of a theory of word structure
	  (morphology) that tries to remedy a number of problems
	  arising from the common view of complex words as structured
	  concatenations of minimal signs or morphemes.  By focusing on
	  relations among words, rather than on their presumed internal
	  pieces, this theory of A-Morphous Morphology arrives at a
	  conception of our knowledge of word structure as a system of
	  rule-based regularities, rather than as the memorization of a
	  collection of basic items.  This notion has important
	  consequences for our understand of the structure of words in
	  general, and also for the relation between word structure and
	  other aspects of grammatical form.

	       In addition to work on morphological theory, I have
	  recently devoted attention to research on the computation 
	  implementation of linguistic theories, especially in 
	  morphology. This is important to general linguistics 
	  because (a) computational implementation forces a degree of
	  explicit formulation much greater than is usual in purely
	  theoretical presentation of theoretical no- tions; and (b)
	  theories of language that pretend to be theories of a real
	  cognitive system must eventually come to terms with the
	  question of how the knowledge they posit is actually put to
	  use. In this work, and in work on phonetic structure and
	  speech perception, a leading role is played by the notion
	  that perception is an active, at least partially synthetic
	  process rather than a purely bottom-up kind of analysis.  In
	  all of my work, I am particularly interested in the study 
	  of linguistic knowledge not simply in its own right, but 
	  as an instance of the general organization of cognition.

Research  Computational models of language acquisition, machine learning of
   Areas  natural language, lexical acquisition, minimimum description-length
          learning.  

Research  My work applies the methods of machine learning and statistics 
 Summary  to the problem of learning the rules and regularities of
	  human languages.  The goals of this research are: (1) to
	  understand how children learn their native languages; (2) to
	  develop and implement algorithms capable of learning the
	  regularities of human languages; and (3) to gain insight into
	  machine learning in general through its application to human
	  languages.  A fundamental tenet of this research is that the
	  human mind is just a particularly specialized computing
	  machine, so human learning is a special case of machine
	  learning.

	  Recently, my work has focused on three projects.  First, how
	  do children learn individual words from a continuous stream
	  of speech in which words are not separated by silent pauses?
	  To study this question, my group developed computer systems
	  that segment phonetic transcriptions of speech into words
	  using the minimum representation length technique.  Results
	  so far show that general pattern-recognition goes a long way
	  toward solving the problem, but a complete solution is likely
	  to require other sources of constraint.  One source of
	  constraint is phonotactics, the language-specific rules that
	  govern the structure of syllables. My experiments show that
	  phonotactic constraints can improve segmentation performance
	  substantially.  Further, a system combining these two
	  techniques performs better when the input is speech to
	  children than when it is speech to adults.  The current
	  question is what properties of child-directed speech make it
	  easier to learn from.

	  I am also working on two projects involving the acquisition
          of morphological rules.  The first is the development 
	  of a computer system for learning morpho-phonological rules
	  such as the one that inserts an "e" between "watch" and the
	  suffix "s" to form "watches", rather than "watchs".  The
	  second involves children's acquisition of regular and
	  irregular past tense forms, a subject that has provoked much
	  debate among cognitive scientists.

LUIGI BURZIO

          Professor of Cognitive Science
          Ph.D., Linguistics and Philosophy, MIT, 1981 

Research  Theory of syntax: anaphora; case and agreement; Romance languages;
   Areas  Theory of phonology: rules versus constraints

Research  My work is in theoretical linguistics, involving two of its 
 Summary  major subdisciplines --syntax and phonology. 

	       Some of my earlier work in syntax, which has become
	  well-known, addresses the basic relations between verbs and
	  their dependents (subject/ objects), contributing to an
	  understanding of complex patterns of agreement and Case
	  marking in some of the Romance languages, as well as of the
	  principles behind the selection of auxiliaries "be" and
	  "have". Burzio pursues related questions in more recent work
	  dealing with the universal principles that underlie the kind
	  of manipulation of grammatical relations that is found in
	  passive and other constructions, where an object is turned
	  into a subject.

	  In other work in syntax, I have studied the expression of
	  coreference in natural languages (technically: "anaphora"),
	  identifying certain correlations between the internal
	  structure of reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns and their
	  different coreferential properties and distributions, thus
	  contributing to an understanding of the universal inventory
	  of such elements and of the principles that govern their use.

	  In phonology, I have produced one book and several articles
	  which call for a sharp departure from theoretical tradition,
	  especially the "rule-based" conception of phonology. This
	  work, all centered around a detailed study of stress and
	  other aspects of the phonology of English, claims to provide
	  new breakthroughs in a number of areas, such as the curious
	  dichotomy among suffixes in the way they affect stress, as
	  in: pa'rent/pare'nt-al (stress shift), versus
	  ame'rican/ame'rican-ist (no shift), and the many changes in
	  vowel quality (/length) occurring in apparently disparate
	  contexts, such as those of: blasphEme/blasphem-ous,
	  defAme/defam-ation, divIne/divin-ity, elizabeth/elizabEth-an,
	  and others.

	  The interaction of Phonology and Morphology (word formation)
	  is currently one major focus of my research.

Research  Cognitive neuropsychology, language, lexical processing,
   Areas  reading, vision, acquired deficits, developmental deficits,
          dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia

Research  I am a cognitive neuropsychologist who studies cognitive 
 Summary  deficits in brain-damaged and learning-disabled individuals 
	  for purposes of developing and evaluating theories describing
	  normal cognitive processes, how these processes are
	  instantiated in the brain, and how they are disrupted when
	  the brain is damaged or fails to develop normally.  In one
	  line of research children and adults with developmental
	  dyslexia undergo extensive cognitive and neurological
	  testing, for purposes of exploring the cognitive and brain
	  processes in normal reading, and elucidating the underlying
	  dysfunctions that may lead to reading disability.  For
	  example, in one ongoing study (McCloskey et al., in press),
	  testing of a college student with reading, spelling, and math
	  deficits has found that these deficits result from a
	  remarkable impairment in localizing objects from vision.  In
	  other research involving brain-damaged patients with
	  impairments in reading, writing, or numerical cognition,
	  patterns of impaired performance provide grounds for
	  conclusions about the forms of mental representation
	  underlying lexical and numerical processing, and the
	  computations carried out over these representations.
	  Neuroimaging and neurophysiological methods are also applied
	  in these studies, to explore relationships between cognitive
	  and brain processes.

          Ph.D., Psychology, Johns Hopkins University, 1990.

Research  Cognitive neuropsychology,  cognitive models of reading and spelling,  
   Areas  disorders of written language, orthographic structure      

Research  Whether we read aloud a word and understand its meaning or
 Summary  express a concept by writing its name, we draw upon the various
          classes of knowledge that we have about words: meaning,
          sound, spelling and grammatical properties.  My research is
          concerned with trying to increase our understanding of these
          knowledge types as well as with defining their specific roles in
          producing and comprehending written language.  
          
          In order to examine the knowledge and procedures required for
          reading and writing I consider the performance of both brain-
          damaged and unimpaired subjects.  Individuals who were
          competent readers and writers before suffering neurological
          impairment provide us with a unique opportunity to observe  the
          ways in which reading and writing systems break down.  The
          study of such cases yields information regarding the cognitive
          and neural organization of the various aspects of our word
          knowledge.  Work with neurologically intact subjects constitutes
          an additional source of information regarding the same issues.

          One current project examines the relationship between our
          knowledge of a word's spelling and its pronunciation.  A brain-
          damaged subject who orally misnames objects (e.g., calling a
          spoon a fork) while at the same time writing the correct name
          provides evidence that the orthography and phonology of words
          can be represented and processed independently.  Another
          project involves determining the way in which the information
          regarding a word's spelling is represented.  The time it takes
          unimpaired subjects to decide if a particular letter is in the
          spelling of word (e.g., Is there an A in camel?)  indicates that
          reaction times vary as a function of the position of a letter within
          a syllable.  Interestingly, the analysis of the spelling errors of a
          brain-damaged subject reveals that error rates also vary
          systematically according to syllable position.  Results such as
          these jointly point to a syllabic organization of orthographic
          representations.

   Areas  soft constraints in universal grammar; Optimality Theory; phonology 
	  and syntax.

Research  I am interested in the following paradox lurking in the study 
 Summary  of cognition.  When we develop precise theories of higher 
	  cognitive domains like language and reasoning, we rely
	  crucially on complex symbolic rule systems like those of
	  grammar and logic.  According to traditional cognitive
	  science and artificial intelligence, such symbolic systems
	  are the very essence of higher intelligence.  Yet we believe
	  intelligence resides in the brain, where computation appears
	  to be numerical, not symbolic; parallel, not serial; rather
	  distributed, not as highly localized as in symbolic systems.
	  Furthermore, when observed carefully, human behavior is
	  sublimely sensitive to the statistical aspect of experience;
	  hard-edged rule systems are ill-equipped to handle these
	  subtleties.  Thus a unified theory of cognition must assign
	  the proper roles to symbolic computation, numerical neural
	  computation, and statistical computation.  This is the basic
	  challenge framing my work.

	  More specifically, the questions that have been guiding my
	  research are these.  What are the central general principles
	  of computation in abstract neural networks, also called
	  connectionist networks?  How can these principles be
	  reconciled with those of symbolic computation?  This work has
	  led me to a computational architecture for cognition which
	  integrates connectionist and symbolic computation.  Can this
	  framework further the theory of higher cognition, by
	  connecting it with lower-level principles derived from neural
	  computation?  With Alan Prince I have developed a grammatical
	  formalism called 'Optimality Theory' which brings general
	  connectionist computational principles into the theory of
	  universal grammar.  This theory has proved quite useful in
	  phonology, where my research continues; with Geraldine
	  Legendre and our students I am currently pursuing research in
	  Optimality Theoretic syntax, learning algorithms, language
	  acquisition, parsing algorithms, and psycholinguistic
	  modeling of on-line human sentence processing.

Research  Psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics,
   Areas  sentence comprehension and processing lexical morphology

Research  My research focuses on the mental representations and processing
 Summary  mechanisms that enable us to produce and comprehend sentences and
	  morphologically complex words (using data from normal
	  subjects and from individuals with acquired language
	  impairments).  Of primary interest to me is how principles of
	  grammar relate to processing representations and the mental
	  operations that are defined over these representations.  In
	  the domain of sentence processing, for example, some of my
	  current research addresses how grammatical constraints on
	  referentially dependant expressions--pronouns, reflexives and
	  reciprocals--interact with other sources of knowledge in the
	  course of interpreting these linguistic expressions.  My
	  studies of lexical representation and processing concern the
	  role of compositional procedures in the comprehension and
	  production of morphologically complex words (e.g., suffixed
	  words like 'natural' and 'swims', or compounds like
	  'shipwreck').  In particular, this research attempts to
	  distinguish between cases of whole-word processing (based on
	  the retrieval of stored representations) and processing that
	  is directly dependant on the capacity to form new
	  representational units by the application of affixing or
	  compounding procedures.

          Ph.D., Linguistics, University of California at San Diego, 1987.
                                     
Research  Theory of syntax; hard vs. soft constraints; Optimality Theory;
   Areas  wh-extractions; grammatical relations; functional projections,
          syntax-semantics interface; French syntax.

Research  My research focuses on understanding the nature of a native speaker's
 Summary  (largely unconscious) knowledge of the syntax of his/her language and
          uncovering which aspects of this linguistic knowledge are universal.

	  My earlier work tested various theoretical claims regarding
	  the nature and the content of principles of syntax.  For
	  example, my book (Legendre, 1994) focuses on the complex
	  interaction and intricate pattern of grammatical
	  constructions in French. I argue that this complex
	  interaction can be explained by a small set of universal
	  principles together with a few constraints specific to
	  French; these principles and constraints refer centrally to
	  Grammatical Relations (subject, direct object, etc.).

	  Language is a cognitive system whose study, I believe, is
	  likely to benefit from theories and methodologies designed
	  for the study of other cognitive systems. A collaborative
	  project with Paul Smolensky has centered on designing a
	  theory based on an approach to computer modeling of cognition
	  known as "connectionism".  Based on theories of computation
	  in neural networks, connectionism is a formal theory of
	  complex interactions of constraints which each may bear
	  different weight in constraining a particular set of
	  phenomena. We have been exploring two related approaches, one
	  called Harmonic Grammar, and the other Optimality Theory.
	  Both treat constraints on language as being of different
	  sorts and different strengths. Harmonic Grammar may be
	  thought of as characterizing low-level interaction of
	  detailed constraints which tend to gang up on stronger
	  constraints, while Optimality Theory characterizes higher
	  level interaction of extremely general, universal,
	  constraints. My current research project focuses on applying
	  Optimality Theory to the complex cross-linguistic patterns of
	  interaction among constraints on syntactic extraction
	  phenomena.

The SPP office recently received news of the publication of a special volume on
 Donald Davidson's philosophy that might be of interest to members.  Entitled L
anguage, Mind and Epistemology:  On Donald Davidson's Philosophy"  (Kluwer Acad
emic Publishers, 1994, ISBN 0-7923-2811-6), the volume examines Davidson's unif
ied stance towards philosophy by joining American and European authors within a
 collection of essays, all of which are published here for the first time.  Aut
hors discuss central topics in Davidson's latest philosophy:  his holistic trut
h-theoretic stance towards meaning and understanding, the epistemology of inter
pretation and translation, the externalist viewpoint in epistemology, the Anti-
Cartesian approach in accounting for first person authority, the thesis of anom
alous monism, and the holistic conception of the mental.

                THE HEBBIAN PARADIGM REINTEGRATED:

    ABSTRACT: The neurophysiological evidence from Miyashita et al.'s
    experiments on monkeys as well as cognitive experience common to us
    all suggests that local neuronal spike rate distributions might
    persist in the absence of their eliciting stimulus. In Hebb's
    cell-assembly theory, learning dynamics stabilize such
    self-maintaining reverberations. Quasi-quantitive modelling of the
    experimental data on internal representations in association-cortex
    modules identifies the reverberations (delay spike activity) as the
    internal code (representation). This leads to cognitive and
    neurophysiological predictions, many following directly from the
    language used to describe the activity in the experimental delay
    period, others from the details of how the model captures the
    properties of the internal representations.

         1995 NEH Summer Seminar for College Teachers
                              
                 PROBLEMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
                              
                Director:  WILLIAM G. LYCAN
                Location:  Department of Philosophy,
                    University of North Carolina,
                    Chapel Hill, NC  27599-3125
                Dates:  July 10 - August 18, 1995
                E-Mail:  conscious@unc.edu

     The past decade has seen at least a small explosion of
published work on the general topic of consciousness.  But
it is not very satisfactory.  There is not even a clear and
shared sense of what is meant by the label, "consciousness."
The seminar will address several different problems
regarding the nature of conscious experience:  What makes a
psychological state a conscious state, as opposed to an un-,
sub-, pre-, or otherwise nonconscious state?  In what sense
are sensory experiences "subjective" or perspectival, and
does that render them inaccessible to science?  Is there an
"explanatory gap" between brain science and the felt
character of experience, and if so, what follows?  What is
the metaphysical nature of the phenomenal properties we
experience in sensation, such as color?
     There will be readings from philosophers and from
psychologists; participants will be encouraged also to work
on their own projects.

Happy holidays to you all!
------------------------------
Here's a painless way to do a good deed......
_______________________________________________________________________

Want to do a kind thing for some hungry kids this holiday season?

Sun Microsystems is donating $0.10 to a food bank each time an Internet
user sends an email msg to any (or all) of the three addresses below:

   santa@north.pole.org
   elves@north.pole.org
   rudolph@north.pole.org

Doesn't matter what the msg contains; it could be an empty msg, full of
invisible holiday spirit. Pick your favorite and send email there a few
times. If *everyone* on the net were to BCC all three addresses with
every
msg they posted to a list for one day, the counter would top out almost
instantly, so this is like a weird and wonderful test of Mass Human
Kindness.

You can do your part to help big fat international corporations make
good on their Promises of donations to charities. It only takes 250,000
msgs to reach the $25,000 Sun promised to donate to a Bay Area food bank
for homeless families. Other corporations are donating to selected
causes,
including a banking firm in Washington DC that will donate up to $5,000
to
the Chesapeake Wildlife Heritage (only 50,000 msgs...li'l baby
birdies...furry baby rabbits... c'MON now! :)

Other corporations are participating too: any firms wishing to add
matching
funds should contact Luther Brown at <elfmaster@north.pole.org>. The
announcement's in the Dec 94 Advanced Systems magazine (pg 22). Who
knows,
someday you might see companies all across the globe donating part of
their
obscene profits to children's charities in Sarajevo, San Francisco,
Manila,
Mogadishu, Bombay, Moscow, Port-au-Prince, Bucharest, Shanghai, Rio de
Janeiro... everywhere Santa stops in.

Remember: any user can send multiple msgs, so please be counted at least
_once_, OK? There are not many such opportunities to directly affect
something with your computer, and it doesn't take the Compassion of
Siddhartha to see what's good about putting food in the mouths of little
children with no home, wherever they are.

  "So this is Christmas,
   And what have you done?..."

According to the home page at http://north.pole.org, this is incorrect. 
They do not want to receive random email.  Sun and some other corporations
will donate money to charity for every time that someone uses a World Wide
Web browser to look at the relevant charity's home page.  Use your web
browser (eg, Mosaic, NetScape, Lynx) to connect to http://north.pole.org. 
Then select the link to "Visit the Cyberspace Christmas Campaign".  It's
kind of a fun site, especially for kids.  And apparently you can cause a
donation to be made.  But (assuming the information on the web is correct)
you won't help them out by inundating them with cc's of all your email! 

I have no connection to any of the relevant organizations.  I just 
happened to look at north.pole.org's home page shortly before I first saw 
a copy of this message.

Best,

Andrew Burday

The following was recently posted to this list.  Please do not send e-mail
to the addresses listed below.  Sun is running a WWW cite such that if you
net over to it, then they will donate $0.10 to charity; however, they give
no money for sending e-mail and are apparently getting swamped with garbage
messages from this note being passed around.

Thank you,

Valerie

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

MONIST INTERACTIVE ISSUE

The Monist. Volume 80, Number 3, July 1997.
 
 Advisory Editors: J. C. Nyiri (Budapest) and
                   Steven Harnad (Southampton)

 Philosophy, like other intellectual disciplines, has been both
 constituted and constrained by the media available for the
 production and exchange of ideas. It is the inventions of writing
 and print which have made scholarly inquiry possible. And as for
 philosophy, some of its seemingly perennial problems in fact arose
 as a consequence of the fact that living (spoken) language had to
 be transformed into language fixed on paper. Writing created the
 isolated thinker, while also allowing the time to think and to
 organize thoughts into lapidary form; but it could not be
 interactive in the way that real-time conversation was, and
 certainly not among multiple interlocutors. Electronic networks
 now offer new conceptual challenges and a new framework for
 philosophizing. This issue of The Monist will itself serve as an
 experiment in new interactive methods of philosophical composition.

HOW THE DISCUSSION/PUBLICATION PROCESS WILL RUN ITS COURSE: 
The issue will be made up of 8 "papers", each destined to be about
7500 words long. Each paper will consist of interactive commentary
(launched by a suitable target or series of targets). The "raw"
discussion will be electronic, moderated (i.e., filtered through
one moderator, but not edited by him) and archived. When the
interaction has run its course, it will be edited down, revised as
necessary, to form a coherent chunk of about 7500 words which
will appear in the usual (paper) format, with a reference to the 
archive of the original "raw" discussion in MONIST.

POSSIBLE TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION might include: 

"The Concept of Knowledge in the Context of Electronic Networking"
"Originality, Plagiarism and Interactivity"
"What Is Computation?" 

A SITE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, where the records of the exchange will
be archived. This is the MONist nETwork site. The URL for MONET is
as follows:

gopher://wings.buffalo.edu.:70/11/academic/department/philosophy/

For the time being, you may simply send copies of your
messages/suggestions/submissions to nyiri@ludens.elte.hu. Those wishing
to volunteer to serve as moderators should contact Nyiri as soon as
possible.

Five important new changes in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (BBS)
addresses, policies and procedures (1-5) plus

Three announcements about positions and activities at my new
institution (Southampton University) (6-8).

Summaries first, then the details:

    (1) New address for submitting BBS target articles
    (2) New address for submitting BBS commentaries
    (3) All commentaries now require asbtracts
    (4) All articles.commentaries now require email version and/or disk
    (5) Target articles now electronically retrievable in multiple ways

    (6) Applications invited for Psychology Professorship at U. Southampton.
    (7) Applications invited for grad students and postdocs to work with me
    (8) Come and give a talk at our new Cognitive Sciences Centre

(1) NEW BBS ADDRESS (Editorial): Effective immediately, ALL SUBMITTED TARGET
ARTICLES AND ALL CORRESPONDENCE PERTAINING TO EDITING AND REFEREEING
should henceforth be addressed to BBS's new Editorial Office:

        Behavioral and Brain Sciences
        Department of Psychology
        University of Southampton
        Highfield, Southampton
        SO17 1BJ UNITED KINGDOM
        phone: 44 703 594-583
        fax:   44 703 593-281
        email: bbs@ecs.soton.ac.uk

All BBS email should go to the email address above; only messages intended
for Stevan Harnad personally should be sent to harnad@ecs.soton.ac.uk --
I now get over 80 emails a day so please, whatever can be answered by
the Managing Editor, send to bbs rather than harnad! 

(2) SECOND NEW BBS ADDRESS: Effective immediately, ALL SUBMITTED
COMMENTARIES (double-spaced, in triplicate, with email version and/or
disk) AND ALL CORRESPONDENCE PERTAINING TO COPY-EDITING AND PROOFS
should henceforth be addressed to:

        Behavioral and Brain Sciences
        Cambridge University Press
        Journals Department
        40 West 20th Street
        New York, NY 10011-4211
	USA
        phone: 800-431-1580 (ext. 369, Ed Miller)

        email: bbs@cup.org  (or emiller@cup.org)

To expedite mailing, all commentaries will be received and logged in New
York and then forwarded to the Editor in Southampton for review.

(3) Effective immediately, every BBS commentary and author's response
must have have an ABSTRACT (~60 words).

(4) Effective immediately, IN ADDITION to the requisite number of hard
copies, all BBS contributions (articles, commentaries, and responses) will
also have to be submitted in electronic form -- by email (preferably) to
bbs@ecs.soton.ac.uk or on a computer disk accompanying the hard copies.
BBS is moving toward more and more electronic processing at all stages.
The result will be much faster, more efficient and fairer procedures.

(5) Electronic versions of the preprints of all BBS target articles can
be retrieved by ftp, archie, gopher or World-Wide-Web from:

       ftp://cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/harnad
       ftp://ftp.princeton.edu/pub/harnad/
       http://cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/
       http://www.princeton.edu/~harnad/
       gopher://gopher.princeton.edu/11/.libraries/.pujournals

This way prospective commentators can let us know that they would like
to be invited to comment on target articles about to circulated for
commentary, and can search the archive for past articles on which they
may wish to contribute Continuing Commentary.

(6) Applications are invited for a full Professorship in Psychology at
the University of Southampton. I am especially interested to hear from
Experimental/Clinical Neuropsychologists with active research
programmes: Please contact me to discuss it informally:
harnad@ecs.soton.ac.uk

of which I am Director, with the collaboration of Professor Michael
Sedgewick (Clinical Neurological Sciences), Professors Tony Hey and
Chris Harris (Electronics and Computer Science), Dr. John Bradshaw
(Anthro-Zoology Institute), Professor Wendy Hall (Multimedia Centre)
and Professor Bob Remington (ex officio, Head of the Psychology
Department).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

           Research Focus of the Laboratory

CATEGORISATION AND COGNITION: Our capacity to categorise is at the
heart of all of our cognitive capacity. People can sort and label the
objects and events they see and hear with a proficiency that still far
exceeds that of our most powerful machines. How do we manage to do it?
The answer will not only tell us more about ourselves but it will allow
us to apply our findings to enhancing our proficiency, both in the
learning of categories and in our use of machines to extend our
capacities.

CATEGORY LEARNING is the most general form of cognition. Animals learn
categories when they learn what is and is not safe to eat, where it is
safe to forage, who is friend and who is foe. Children learn the same
kinds of categories, but they eventually go on to the much more powerful
and uniquely human strategy of learning categories by name, rather then
by performing some instrumental response on them, such as eating or
fleeing. Whether they categorise by instrumental response or by name,
however, children must still have direct experience with the objects
they are categorising, and some sort of corrective feedback from the
consequences of MIScategorising them. Eventually, however, categories
can be learned from strings of symbols alone, with most of those
symbols being themselves the names of categories. This is the most
remarkable of our cognitive capacities, language, but language and
cognition cannot be understood unless we analyse how they are grounded
in categorisation capacity (Harnad 1990). This is theme of our
research programme.

BEHAVIORAL, COMPUTATIONAL AND NEURAL APPROACHES: There are three
empirical ways to investigate the functional basis of our
categorisation capacity. The first way is to (i) analyse our
categorisation performance itself experimentally, particularly how we
LEARN to categorise. The second way is to (ii) model our categorisation
capacity with computers that must learn the same categories that we do,
on the basis of the same input and corrective feedback that we get. The
third way is to (iii) monitor brain function while we are learning
categories, to determine what neural properties change during the
course of learning, and to relate them to the performance changes
during learning, as well as to the internal functioning of the machine
models performing the same task. These three converging lines of
investigation are the ones to be pursued in the Cognitive Psychology
Laboratory.

                       Binghamton University
                             Announces
               Interdisciplinary Graduate Studies in
                            Philosophy
                               and
                   Computers and Cognitive Sciences
                             (PACCS)
          
   With the cooperation and assistance of the Computer Science and
Psychology Departments, the Philosophy Department of SUNY-Binghamton offers
an innovative, interdisciplinary MA/PhD program in Philosophy. This program is
designed to integrate the disciplines of philosophy, cognitive science,
artificial intelligence, computer science and systems science.
                                       
The program:
 * examines the philosophical assumptions of artificial intelligence, and 
evaluates systems science and computer science from the perspective of logic,
philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language
 * is designed to unify recent, exciting developments in these fields, so that 
further advances may be made in each, and so that there may be continual 
interaction among them
 * trains students in modelling techniques, so that they may formulate vaguely
stated philosophical issues precisely enough to be programmed
 * trains students to use computer models to bring empirical considerations to
bear on the evaluation of philosophical theories.

PACCS is designed to prepare students for:
 * research and teaching that require interdisciplinary knowledge in
Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science
 * new directions in professional philosophy, viz. the use of programs (computer
or information processing models) as an investigative tool for the analysis of
traditional philosophical problems
 * cognitive science programs

    ABSTRACT Organisms engage in various activities that are directed
    at objects, whether real or imagined. Such activities cab be called
    "intentional relations." We present a four-level framework for
    social understanding which organizes the ways in which social
    organisms represent their own intentional relations those of other
    agents.  The information available to an organism about its own
    intentional relations (or first person information) is
    qualitatively different from the information available to that
    organism about other agents' intentional relations (or third person
    information). Through the integration of these two sources of
    information, it is possible to generate representations of
    intentional relations that are uniformly applicable to the
    activities of both self and other. The four levels of the framework
    differ in the extent to which such integration occurs and in the
    degree to which imagination is involved in generating these
    representations. Most animals are at the lowest level, at which
    integration of first and third person sources of information does
    not occur. Among nonhuman species, only great apes exhibit social
    understanding at intermediate levels, at which integration of these
    sources of information provides uniform representations of
    intentional relations. Only humans attain the highest level, at
    which it is possible to represent intentional relations to mental
    objects. We propose that with the development of the imagination,
    children progress through three stages, equivalent to the later
    three levels of the framework. The abnormalities in social
    understanding of autistic individuals may result from a failure to
    develop integrated representations of intentional relations.

     We are pleased to announce a conference on the basic cognitive
processes that underlie creativity in general, and the emergence
of new ideas in particular.  The conference is funded by the
American Psychological Association, and will take place on May 18-
20, 1995 at Texas A&M University.
     Creative thinking is essential for scientific, technological,
artistic, and personal accomplishment, and hence, cognitive
psychology must begin to examine its nature.  Where do new ideas
come from?  How are discoveries made?  How is old knowledge mapped
onto novel situations?  How are old, incorrect representations
replaced with more accurate, innovative ones?  Answers to these
important questions are beginning to emerge from careful analyses
of basic cognitive structures and processes.  The conference will
feature presentations and discussion by some of the preeminent
researchers working on these issues.  The scheduled topics,
presenters, and discussants are:

May 19, 1995:

Session I: Emergence of Novelty in Conceptual Combination

                  Thinking Computers and Virtual Persons:
                  Essays on the Intentionality of Machines
                         edited by Eric Dietrich
                    Academic Press, ISBN 0 12 215495 9


	Here is some information on a new book on the philosophical
problem of whether or not computers can think.  The book is called
THINKING COMPUTERS and VIRTUAL PERSONS.  It presents the case FOR the
position that computers can think, and that the human brain is a kind
of computer.  Its main target is John Searle's Chinese Room Argument.
Below are the preface, the table of contents, a brief discussion of
each of the papers the book contains.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    I.

                                 Preface

	This book is dedicated to the view that cognition is
computation.  It presents a sustained and multifaceted defense of this
view against a suite of arguments developed over the last several
years designed to show that thinking -- cognition -- cannot be
computing.  The view being defended is call computationalism .  It
has two corollaries: computers can think, and the human mind is itself
a kind of computer.  Computationalism is the foundation of modern
cognitive science, a broad field which includes everything from
artificial intelligence to cognitive psychology to computational
neuroscience.   

	The suite of arguments being attacked revolves around the
notion of meaning or semantics.  In one way or another, all these
arguments seek to establish that a machine's computations are
inherently meaningless.  Computers are fancy tools, nothing more.
Just as a hammer knows nothing about the nail it is used to pound, so
computers know nothing about the information they process.  Computers
don't do things; things are done to them by people.  The anti-semantic
arguments tap into deeply held intuitions that computers are just not
the sorts of things one can correctly view as cognitive agents, as
persons.

	The anti-semantic arguments are attacked full force here.  I
believe they are refuted.  Beyond that, positive theories are here
advanced explaining how computations are meaningful and how computers
can be cognitive agents like you and me.  By the end of the book, I
believe that a good case has been made for computationalism. 

	Making this case is the point of the book.  This project
started when I noticed that the case against computationalism seemed
to be waxing in spite of the fact that there were several papers and
results in the literature showing that computationalism was alive and
well, and doing the job it was supposed to do: supporting
late-twentieth century research into the nature of the mind and brain.
The papers and results were being overlooked and ignored.  I thought
that if the best of them were pulled together into a single
collection, their mutual impact would be stronger.  They would then be
harder to ignore.

	The real test of the thesis that cognition is computation can
only be made in the day to day working of cognitive scientists, and
seeing whether or not we are eventually successful in explaining
computationally how brains produce minds and in programming a machine
to think.  But as matters now stand, computation is the single most
important notion in the foundation of cognitive science.  Between this
book and the daily victories of cognitive science, I think its role is
secured.

	This book is meant to be self-contained.   Read the
introduction first.  I explain there, in nontechnical language, the
major terms, concepts, and issues so that any person interested in the
issues of minds and machines can follow the debates in the rest of the
book.

                                    III.
				The Papers

	The papers in the first section are by authors who are dubious
about the very existence of intentionality as understood by most
philosophers.  Resnick's paper finds an analogy between intentionality
and phlogiston, the seventeenth century principle of burning that was
later mistakenly reified as a substance thought to be released from a
burning object.  Phlogiston theory is no longer with us, and for a
very interesting reason, Resnick contends -- a reason that applies to
intentionality also.  The standard knock on phlogiston theory is that
it had the fatal flaw of many old, brave theories: it made empirical
claims that turned out to be false.  The substance, phlogiston, was
supposed to have negative weight; a property logically required if
phlogiston was to explain the relevant chemical facts.  Resnick's
paper represents a good bit of historical sleuthing, and shows us that
the demise of phlogiston theory was long and complex, involving more
than just empirically false claims.  These historical details make
phlogiston theory and intentionality analogous -- to the detriment of
intentionality.

	Fields' paper is in the systems reply camp and brings an
experimental perspective to the problem of intentionality and
computation.  One objection to computationalism is that it cannot
prevent arbitrary attributions of content to the various data
structures and representations involved in a computational process.
Apparently then, we are free to interpret any computational process
any way we want.  Fields considers the process of constructing a
computational interpretation from measurements of a system's behavior,
and shows that this objection is incorrect.  The analysis of how
contents are attributed to states based on experimental observations
also shows that the requirement of a flow of control between states
places strong constraints on the semantics.  These constraints provide
a distinction between arbitrarily attributed content and stipulated
content.  Intentionality, on Fields' view, is ubiquitous: any system
which interacts with its environment is intentional.  Intentionality
cannot, therefore, be used as a criterion to draw principled
distinctions between systems of different kinds.

	Dennett believes that the notion of original intentionality is
incoherent.  The distinction between the derived intentionality of
books and our own sui generis intentionality emerging ex nihilo from
our brains is unsustainable and, anyway, quite useless.  He argues for
this by first distinguishing between "real" and "as-if"
intentionality, a distinction orthogonal to "original" versus
"derived" intentionality.  Then using a clever thought experiment of
his own -- a variant of the Robot Reply -- he manages to turn Searle's
result upside down: not even the person in the room has original
intentionality.  Mother Nature -- evolution in all its glory -- turns
out to be the font of intentionality, and all intentionality is
derived intentionality, including Mother Nature's.  Assuredly we all,
including Mother Nature, have real intentionality.  But nothing has
original intentionality.  (One can read Dennett's paper as claiming
that Mother Nature alone possesses original intentionality, the rest
of us, plants, animals, books, and computers, possess derived
intentionality only.  On this reading, original intentionality would
be a coherent concept, but no threat to computationalism.)

	My own paper goes in this section because, as I indicated in
section 2 above, I'm skeptical that the standard philosophical notion
of intentionality is sufficiently independent both of consciousness
and process semantics.  I'm also impressed by the fact that if
Searle's argument were correct, then original intentionality would be
useless, because, by hypothesis, the room's behavior is
indistinguishable from mine.  The intelligence of the room, therefore,
is completely independent of its intentionality.  Intelligence is
a phenomenon we can study scientifically, intentionality is not.

	The next section contains papers arguing that, when one is
careful about definitions, computers naturally have, or can have,
intentionality of a useful sort.  Most of the papers supporting the
systems reply are here.

	Cole spends the first part of his paper discussing and
analyzing the non sequitur at the heart of Searle's argument.  Then
beginning at the cpu level (the central processing unit), he
speculates on how computers could have semantics, understanding,
sentience, and finally consciousness.  Along the way, he clarifies all
of these notions.  Cole's position is that the alleged impossibility
of computer cognition rests on misunderstandings of the definitions of
these cognitive terms and concepts.

	The Churchlands present a compelling and eye-opening analogy
between Searle and an imagined, mid-19th century objector to Maxwell's
claim that light is electromagnetic waves.  Where Searle proposes his
Chinese Room, Maxwell's opponent proposes "the luminous room."
Exposing the conceptual error of the luminous room argument, cleanly
exhibits the similar error in the Chinese Room Argument.  The
Churchlands' paper is important for another, separate reason.  The
Churchlands are not friends of traditional AI.  Their sympathies lie
with artificial neural networks (ANNs).  They believe that the only
way to build an intelligent machine is build a neural network.  Neural
networks, they point out, have a host of very interesting properties
that standard AI algorithms lack.  Some cognitive scientists with
similar sympathies think that ANN-based machines, unlike digital
computers, are immune to Searle's objection because such machines are
continuous analog devices, like brains (of course, when modeled on a
computer ANNs are not analog continuous devices; they are discrete and
digital).  These researchers believe that neural networks' continuity
somehow enables them to hook up to the world in the way required for
endowing them with semantics and hence intentionality.  The
Churchlands will have none of this.  Their position is that cognition
is an architectural achievement.  ANNs, but not standard AI machines
come closer to the right architecture.  However, both kinds of
machines are plenty semantical and have the capability for complete
intentionality.

	Dyer contains one of the best versions of the systems reply
I've read.  He makes the point I briefly mentioned above that
eliminating the room by having Searle memorize the rules for
manipulating Chinese characters produces a split-personality.  One of
them is Searle, a philosopher at the University of California at
Berkeley; the other is, say, a Chinese historian who also happens to
live in Berkeley.  The split just happens to be very exact and
complete.  Both personalities have all the intentionality their hearts
could desire.  Dyer also rehearses several related
intentionality-based arguments attacking computationalism as well as
their rebuttals.

	Perlis proposes an architecture which would enable an
artificial reasoner to refer to objects in its external environment.
Referring to such external objects is just another name for
intentionality.  When one successfully refers to my pet spider, Fang,
one has an internal representation which stands for Fang, and one
takes that representation to stand for Fang.  This last condition --
taking an internal representation to stand for something -- is one of
Perlis's key points: both the representation and the fact that it
represents something must be in some sense internal to the reasoner.
Put another way, Perlis' view is that in order to successfully refer
(to have intentionality) a machine (or you, for that matter) must have
a model of an inner world modeling an external world.  Here he
presents a way to build a system with such an internal structure.

	Finally, Rapaport argues, contra Searle, that computers can
understand natural language and thus be humanly intelligent (Rapaport
believes that understanding a natural language is necessary and
sufficient for human-level intelligence).  He also takes on Fred
Dretske, another philosopher who is convinced that computers can't
think because they allegedly lack intentionality.  Like Perlis,
Rapaport stresses the internal relation between representations for
semantics and cognition.  But there is a twist.  Searle and others of
his ilk have long claimed that computers, but not humans, are purely
syntactic machines : manipulating symbols without knowing what they
mean; this is why machines lack intentionality.  In fact, the purely
syntactic nature of computation is what the Chinese Room Argument is
intended to show.  Rapaport agrees that computers are syntactical, but
argues that syntax suffices for semantics, hence computers are not
purely syntactical.  The internal relationships between
representations turns out to be sufficient for semantics.  Rapaport's
arguments are made all the more compelling because he and his
colleagues have a system that understands some English.  This system
is called CASSIE. Rapaport discusses it in his paper.

	The last section is about intentionality in the larger world.
Three topics are discussed: consciousness, psychological explanation,
and psychology.  As we've seen, consciousness is intimately related to
intentionality, maybe too intimately.  The two might be different
names for the same thing.  They might be identical -- the
ultimate intimacy.  Well what about consciousness itself?  Could
consciousness be a computation?  Can it be explained mechanistically?
Many philosophers think not.  Leonard Angel is not one of them.  Angel
discusses five key arguments designed to show that whatever
consciousness is, it can't be a computational phenomenon.  He
systematically takes each argument apart, exposing its flaws.  Angel
concentrates on three arguments: an argument presented recently by
Searle is shown to rest on an ambiguity.  A standard source of
pessimism concerning AI aspirations is considered and a response is
given based on Angel's strategy for showing how "conventionalizing
mutuality" is programmable.  And an important argument first offered
by Noam Chomsky, which has not received widespread attention, is
reconstructed and a detailed critical analysis is presented.  The
argument is found to rest on an incorrect premise.  Angel concludes
with a positive section, suggesting ways in which the computational
view of cognition and the mind enhances our understanding of
consciousness.

	Charles Wallis is concerned with the explanatory role
representation plays in theories in cognitive science.  On Wallis's
view, many cognitive scientists, most notably Jerry Fodor and Fred
Dretske, have incorrect views about what phenomena representations
explain and how they explain them.  These confusions in turn fuel
further confusion about the nature of intentionality.  Wallis argues
that representation is not required to explain behavior, as is
traditionally supposed.  He points out that representation explains
cognitive capacities.  He then argues that, at the foundational level,
researchers have reversed the order of the phenomena that need to be
explained.  Typically, researchers explain representation in terms of
what one can know (i.e., in terms of epistemology).  Instead, Wallis
argues, cognitive scientists should explain what one can know in terms
of representation, i.e., in terms of what the organism can represent.
Finally, he argues that, after everything is put in the right order,
there is still an important role for epistemology in psychological
theories and explanations.

	Hayes, Ford, and Adams-Webber take on Joseph Rychlak (and by
association, Searle and Roger Penrose (1989)).  Rychlak claimed that
an entire, and successful, theoretical framework in cognitive
psychology is incompatible with the view that human brains are
computers of some sort.  They explain the theoretical framework:
personal construct theory, then show how it is, in fact, compatible
with computationalism.  Indeed, they argue that cognitive psychology
and AI are methodologically joined at the hip, and that this is good
for both.  In the course of their paper, they also discuss in detail
the notion of a virtual machine , and its close cousin, the notion
that though modern hardware is Boolean (two-valued: "true" and
"false"), software need not be, and usually isn't.  Finally, they
spend time discussing the discomfort computational models of mind and
cognition cause, and suggest remedies.

	This concludes my opening statement.  The defense of
computationalism and computational cognitive science now begins in
earnest.  I hope that by the end of the book, you are persuaded that
support for computationalism and cognitive science is strong enough to
warrant releasing us on our own recognizance.  Of course, we might
still succeed in hanging ourselves.  Only time and vigorous research
will tell.  But even if we do hang ourselves, it won't be because of
some conceptual error we've made, as the anticomputationalist
philosophers and psychologists would have you believe.  If we do fail,
it will be for methodological reasons -- the deepest reasons of all.

    ABSTRACT: Human interaction, as opposed to aggregation, occurs in
    face-to-face groups. "Sociality theory" proposes that such groups
    have a nested, hierarchical structure, consisting of a few basic
    variations, or "core configurations." These function in the
    coordination of human behavior, and are repeatedly assembled,
    generation to generation, in human ontogeny, and in daily life. If
    face-to-face groups are "the mind's natural environment," then we
    should expect human mental systems to correlate with core
    configurations. Features of groups that recur across generations
    could provide a descriptive paradigm for testable and non-intuitive
    evolutionary hypotheses about social and cognitive processes.  This
    target article sketches three major topics in sociality theory,
    roughly corresponding to the interests of biologists,
    psychologists, and social scientists. These are (1) a multiple
    levels-of-selection view of Darwinism, part group selectionism,
    part developmental systems theory; (2) structural and psychological
    features of repeatedly assembled, concretely situated face-to-face
    coordination; and (3) superordinate, "unsituated" coordination at
    the level of large-scale societies. Sociality theory predicts a
    tension, perhaps unresolvable, between the social construction of
    knowledge, which facilitates coordination within groups, and the
    negotiation of the habitat, which requires some correspondence with
    contingencies in specific situations. This tension is relevant to
    ongoing debates about scientific realism, constructivism, and
    relativism in the philosophy and sociology of knowledge.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Most behavioral and social sciences assume human sociality is a
by-product of individualism. Briefly put, individuals are fundamentally
self-interested; "social" refers to the exchange of costs and benefits
in the pursuit of outcomes of purely personal value, and "society" is
the aggregate of individuals in pursuit of their respective
self-interests. To this view of "economic man," which long pre-dated
Darwin, sociobiology added the idea that individual advantage could be
measured in the currency of genes. In theories stressing the importance
of group living, conspecifics are viewed largely as a class of objects,
more unpredictable than others, but requiring substantial intelligence
on the part of the actor to use these "social objects" to achieve
genetic ends through alliances, manipulation, or exploitation (Byrne &
Whiten, 1988). In contrast, by "social," I refer to a structural
continuum of obligate interdependence, without which individual
prospects for reproduction and survival to reproductive age are
reduced.

2. Humans are obligately interdependent, not only for acquiring their
daily bread, but also for the daily operation of their minds. When Adam
Smith proposed the "invisible hand" of self-interest, he took for
granted that the butcher, the brewer, the baker -- and their families
who worked in the business -- were organized in workshops, which were
in guilds, which were in villages, which were in districts, which had
seasonal fairs and religious celebrations. In the 18th century, the
skills for butchering, brewing, and baking were accumulated through
generations, passed from adult to child, and repeated in daily, weekly
and seasonal cycles of activity. Butchering, brewing and baking
demanded finely tuned sensory and motor coordination; familiarity with
variable materials, tools and methods; a marketplace, of course; and
coordination among these physical, mental and social components.
Today, telecommunications and transportation technologies expose the
significance of this coordination. People still organize themselves in
groups, but some of these no longer need to be face-to-face groups,
constrained by space and time in a nested hierarchy of guild, village,
district, etc.

3. Hull (1988) described a nested hierarchical organization in science
similar to the one in village life; a "demic structure" composed of
small research groups, "conceptual demes," and seasonal society
meetings. This description accords very well with psychological
research on the nested, hierarchical structure of social identity
(Turner, 1987). I propose that the demic structure of science described
by Hull is more general, and it is paralleled by a "demic structure" of
mind.[1] The parallelism suggests that the "mind's natural
environment" can be more adequately specified in terms of functional
organizational structure than it can be by invoking inclusive fitness
theory and "life in the Pleistocene" (Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). Given a
descriptive paradigm of the human evolutionary environment, it should
be possible to derive testable, nonobvious hypotheses about human
mental systems.

4. Before we can consider the "invisible hand" of demic structure,
however, we need an evolutionary framework that relieves us of the
individualistic assumptions built into the gene-centered view. The
traditional single-level, gene-centered evolutionary analysis, based on
genetic self-sacrifice, inclusive fitness, or number of offspring, does
not lend itself to discussions of hierarchical organization for social
structure or mental systems.

II. EVOLUTION

5. If evolution is conceived merely as changes in population gene
frequencies, then the only factors of evolutionary interest will be
those passed on in the zygotic DNA. Accordingly, environmental factors
are, at best, secondary to evolutionary change, and development is a
side issue (Oyama, 1992). For the study of most non-human organisms,
this view has been useful, at least to the extent that a high
correspondence between genotype and phenotype could be assumed. In the
human case, that assumption has been much more troublesome. For genes
to be of any interest in the study of mind and behavior, they must be
conceived as much more than a step in protein production. They are
"for" a useful attribute, as in "genes for" kin altruism or "genes for"
rape, mathematical ability, mate preferences, or cognitive mechanisms
specialized for producing the behavior. Although the environment is
secondary, it may fill in gaps in "open programs," "shape" innate
proclivities, or "shunt" behavior from one option to another. This is a
vague gene-environment interactionism that privileges the gene and
invites the useless imagery of the habitat as the environment for DNA.
There are several problems with this version of evolution, not least of 
which is the difficulty of demonstrating genetic specificity for particular 
mechanisms, or reproductive variation corresponding to particular 
genotypic variation. If the appeal to genes is interpreted 
metaphorically, it presupposes aspects of behavior that are matters of 
empirical investigation: the universality of behavior, the difficulty
of changing behavior, and the fixity of its form (Oyama, 1985).

6. The restructuring I propose draws on three strands of thought:
hierarchical views of evolutionary phenomena, which locate genes in
their appropriate environment -- the cell; developmental systems
theory, which emphasizes the contextual and contingent events in the
flux living phenomena, and teleofunctionalism or "proper functions,"
which offers a historical definition of function and a taxonomy for the
classification of function. The result is a notion of "repeated
assembly," where nature-nurture and biology culture distinctions are
eliminated. They are replaced with questions about the reliability and
durability of replication rather than conflicts about "how much" can be
attributed to genetic or environmental determinism.

III. HIERARCHY

7. A hierarchical, or expanded, evolutionary theory (Brandon, 1990;
Buss, 1987; Campbell, 1974; Wilson and Sober, in press) recasts
Darwinism in a form that can accommodate the human case without
resorting to nature-nurture dualism. The nested, hierarchical
organization of life allows for selection on multiple levels of
organization -- macromolecules, genes, cell lineages, individuals, and
on occasion, groups. Each of these entities is situated in its specific
selective environment. Entities at one level can function as
"environment" or context for entities at another level. Thus, the
"gene-environment" interaction occurs between DNA and the local
cellular machinery. Genetic variants are sorted in differential births
and deaths, which are a function of organism-environment interactions;
they are selected in the context of cellular machinery. The
persistence, or continued replication, of lower level units is
crucially dependent on the maintenance of the organized unit
interfacing with the habitat. Hence, evolutionary analysis, distinct
from other kinds of biological analysis, focuses on the interfaces
between levels -- the coordination or lack thereof among levels of
organization.

8. The hierarchical perspective re-orients us in two important
respects. First, the focus is on functional relations between entity
and environment, rather than just traits of the organism.
Distinguishing between traits and functions is significant for adaptive
explanation generally (Griffiths, 1992). In the human case
specifically, the distinction allows that a functional relationship may
be achieved through others or even artificially. For example, humans
can have disabilities that in other species would be terminal, but
humans may use "artificial traits" (e.g., wheelchairs, canes,
eyeglasses) to achieve basic functional relationships such as
locomotion or vision. The results of natural selection are not "traits"
in the usual sense of static features possessed by an organism, but
relational linkages between organism and environment. Second, these
relations are concretely situated in specific contexts, available to
empirical investigation. For example, there is no basis for assuming,
as the trait view does, that an individual who may act socially
dominant in a dyad will also be socially dominant in a group of five
people working on a shared problem.

IV. REPEATED ASSEMBLY

9. Social scientists are uncomfortable with the determinism suggested
by genecentric evolutionary thought. For example, Crawford (1989), a
committed evolutionist, reassured his colleagues in psychology that
they need not believe that natural selection is currently occurring to
use an evolutionary approach; they need only assume that evolution
occurred in the past. Evolution, this view suggests, has stopped.
Ideally, we would like to restate human evolutionary theory in a form
that satisfies the general constraints of Darwinism (Endler, 1986;
Brandon, 1990), facilitates "matches" between evolutionary theory and
human psychological and social science data, and does not lend itself
to mindlessly legitimating existing social and political inequities
(Caporael & Brewer, 1991).

10. Contra Crawford (1989), organisms are the continuation of
evolutionary processes rather than the result of them. This view
allows relations between entity and contexts, over the lifespan and
over generations, to function as both cause and effect over time (cf.
Brandon, 1990; Gray, 1992; Levins & Lewontin, 1985; Oyama, 1985). We
are no longer talking in the billiard ball universe of linear causes
where we can imagine that genes cause or predispose traits, which are
then modified by the environment. The analogy is closer to a shared
language (relation) where (entity) speakers' utterances are both caused
by and cause other (environment) speakers' utterances. Just as
speakers are more interested in the "fit" between their utterances
(rather than, say, the specific language they are using), so is
our interest in the "fit" between entities and environments that
feature in evolutionary processes (i.e., some relations persist, others
don't).

11. "Repeated assemblies" are recurrent entity-environment relations
composed of hierarchically organized, heterogeneous components having
differing frequencies and scales of replication. This mouthful
definition needs to be unpacked in pieces. To start, a mammalian
zygote, for example, is the repeated assembly of two sources of DNA,
centrosomes from the sperm, and other components, all of which, if in
the right place, at the right time, automatically result in a zygote.
There is no "genetic program" that directs or controls the assembly of
the zygote. Instead, the analogy is to a chemical reaction, where,
given a set of constituents, against a background of enabling
conditions, an explosion, a precipitate or a vapor results -- or
repeatedly assembles.

12. At the level of the organism, genes will always be among the
multiple, heterogeneous resources of a repeated assembly (the
organism), but they are inert without the epigenetic components at
their own and other levels. Genetic action is dependent on the reliable
recurrence of appropriate contexts, from cellular machinery to social
events to constancies of atmosphere (Griffiths & Gray, 1994). Neither
genes nor environment are privileged (although the microbiologist would
still focus on genes and the educational psychologist might focus on
classrooms). Some resources will themselves be repeated assemblies:
ideas, customs, artifacts, learned skills, languages, and group
configurations can all be repeatedly assembled.

13. Some repeated assemblies have, in Millikan's (1984) sense, "proper
functions." That is, a relation repeatedly assembles ("is selected")
because in the past (see below) the co-occurrence of organismic and
environmental components in some particular relation (e.g., timing,
frequency, contingency) contributed to the persistence of the assembly
contingent on particulars of setting. Repeated assemblies are all but
infinitely variable because they are concretely situated. No two
digestive tracts are identical; sometimes there is a difference that
makes a difference (e.g., lactose intolerance). No two breakfasts are
ever exactly alike, but breakfast is repeatedly assembled; not by
everyone, not every where in the world, but often enough to be
extracted and named as a category for human minds. Change in any
component, genetic or epigenetic, can alter an assembly, increasing or
decreasing the likelihood of its future assembly, or having no
particular effect at all. "In the past" may refer to time measured in
terms of ontogeny (in "habits of a lifetime"), to cultural-historical
time ("2,000 years of Western civilization"), or to geological-
evolutionary time. Thus, assemblies may persist in evolutionary time,
among Americans, in the Smith family, or in J. Smith.

14. The proper function of a repeated assembly is not necessarily the
normative outcome. Most sperm never fulfill their proper function;
most acorns become humus. Some repeated assemblies have no function;
they result from illusory contingencies, such as the superstitious
circling of pigeons in a Skinner box. Other repeated assemblies may
have had a function at one time, but become dissociated from it.
Langer (1989) tells the story of a friend who would always cut a slice
off the end of a roast before placing it in the oven. To make a long
story short, the colleague said she did this because her mother did it;
mother said she did it because her mother did it; grandmother shed
light on the practice: the pan she used for roasting was too small to
accommodate the whole piece of meat. Such dissociations may occur in
evolutionary time, giving rise to vestiges, and in historical-cultural
time, giving rise to customs that have no function or even incur costs
(Boyd & Richerson, 1985).

15. Sources of heritability (i.e., acquired or innate traits) have no 
a priori significance in descriptions of repeated assemblies.
Paradoxically, however, the notion of heritability is expanded. As
humans, we inherit not only genes, but also attitudes, practices,
place, nationality, expectations for behavior, and so forth. There may
be change within lifetimes, but this simply indicates low reliability of
repetition. Heritability itself is thus no indicator of the
universality, fixity, or difficulty of changing organism-environment
relations.

16. The difference between the gene-centered view and the expanded
heritability of repeated assembly can be illustrated. Tooby and
Cosmides (1992) argue, as do developmental system theorists (e.g.,
Levins & Lewontin, 1985; Oyama, 1985), that phenotypic features are
fully codetermined by genes and environment in development throughout
the lifespan; that the phenotype cannot be analyzed into separate
genetically determined and environmentally determined components; that
events at one stage of development are contingent on the products of
prior developmental outcomes, and that both genes and developmentally
relevant environments are outcomes of evolutionary processes. Yet,
Tooby and Cosmides (1992) also assert that developmental programs in
the genes create the relation between environmental conditions and
developmental outcomes. Thus, a child raised in social isolation may
not acquire language, but nevertheless will have a species-typical
language acquisition device.

17. If we view language as a repeated assembly, however, we could allow
that such a child might have genes for a language acquisition device,
but lacking a critical component, a language environment, that device
was never assembled. Both the genes and the language environment must
be inherited. English speaking and Kikuyu speaking differ because the
various elements have different cycles of repetition. One set, which
includes genes, has a longer cycle of repetition relative to another
set, which includes the language environment. Both sets are repeatedly
assembled, but on different scales of time. The cycle of language
environment (English or Kikuyu), in cultural-historical time, is nested
within the cycle of other components, including genes, in evolutionary
time. Although the frequency and scale of the cycles may be roughly
distinguished, it makes little sense to separate language into an
innate and an acquired component; both are parts of inherited
resources. Nested within these two cycles of evolutionary time and
historical-cultural time, is a third one, the sine qua non of variation
and evolutionary process: the situated relation of "organism-in-
setting," (e.g., a child raised in social isolation) where the
conditions for an assembly to be repeated, be it later in the day or in
succeeding generations, take place or fail to take place.

18. In the next section, we consider the relations humans repeatedly
assemble in evolutionary time. These form the contexts for repeated
assemblies of shorter cycle lengths in historical and lifespan time and
the basis for superordinate coordination.

V. COORDINATION

19. Human evolutionary theorists agree that group living was a critical
feature in human evolution. They disagree about the causes and
consequences. In my view, groups functioned and continue to function as
an interface between individual and habitat. Although this is a
substantial assumption, it does allow us to unburden ourselves from a
host of lesser assumptions about the past and to construct a
"minimalist scenario." We assume there would have been both minimum and
maximum constraints on group size: too small a group would have a
higher risk of perishing; too large a group strains the carrying
capacity of the environment. The "envelope" for selection for sociality
is thus a function of the physical parameters of the species morphology
and ecology. The combination of minimum and maximum group size
constraints has several important theoretical consequences.

20. First, to the extent that exploiting a habitat is more successful
as a collective group process than as an individual process, not only
would more successful groups persist, but so also would individuals
better adapted to group-living. Because a group mediates individual
contact with the environment, and the number of "niches" within groups
is limited, fitness should have been correlated with the evolution of
perceptual, affective and cognitive processes that support the
development and maintenance of group membership (Caporael, Dawes,
Orbell & van de Kragt, 1989; Brewer & Caporael, 1990). One consequence
of these dynamics is a ratcheting, feed-forward evolutionary process
where other constraints, including cognitive ones, constrain group size
(cf. Dunbar, 1993; Wilson & Sober, 1994). We would expect humans
to be obligately interdependent; that is, their prospects for survival
and reproduction outside group contexts would be greatly diminished.

21. Second, "self-interest" at the individual level would be
necessarily, albeit incompletely, constrained by requirements for group
coordination and group fissioning. A corollary is that groups would
reproduce by fissioning, not by dispersing individuals or dyads. Third,
humans have not evolved to apprehend "true beliefs" in the sense
implied by prescriptive rationality, realism, or objective knowledge,
but rather to develop, maintain and negotiate face-to-face group
membership. (Note that I am not saying humans cannot do these things,
but rather that they have not evolved to do them.) Fourth, mental
systems specialized for face-to-face interdependency in evolutionary
time must be "reweavable" for the production of large-scale social
coordination, which has appeared in historical-cultural time; that is,
humans have no evolutionarily specialized adaptations for agricultural
or urban living. 

VI. CORE CONFIGURATIONS

22. Human face-to-face interaction, repeatedly assembled,
generation-to-generation, over evolutionary time, is a continuation of
the nested hierarchy of life's functional organization. I propose four
"core configurations" of situated, face-to-face activity: dyad,
family/workgroup or team, face-to face group or deme, and macroband or
macrodeme. These labels are not intended to represent social roles, or
even necessarily individuals: they represent kinds of interactions. A
dyad is an interaction between two entities, one of which can be non-
human. "Family/workgroup" does not specifically refer to families or
workgroups, but to "small-group, common task orientation" interactions.
Of course, such interactions are frequent in both families and
workgroups, but, as we shall see, are not limited to such social
groups.

23. Configurations are "core" because they are repeatedly assembled in
hunter-gatherer groups (Birdsell, 1972; Jarvenpa and Brumbach, 1988) --
presumably in evolutionary time, but also in human ontogenetic
sequences, and in day-to-day activity. Each configuration is associated
with a group size, which should be considered more like a center of
gravity than a fixed condition, and "modal tasks" for interacting with
the environment. The general idea is that size/task configurations are
stable and repeated generation-to-generation in evolutionary history as
a functional consequence of the physical interaction between species'
morphology and ecology. From a strictly evolutionary historical
perspective, core configurations are affordances for the evolution of
proper functions. That is, a size/task configuration is a specialized
affordance for the repeated assembly and evolution of various proper
functions. An affordance allows a proper function to occur, but there
is no necessity that the proper function will assemble given the
affordance.

24. Table 1 sketches a model of this structure. (I have used the terms
"deme" and "macrodeme" to indicate a greater generality than the use of
"band" or "macroband" by anthropologists.) The combination of size and
modal task (not just size alone) constitute a specialized affordance
for the evolution and repeated assembly of proper functions.

    * Except for dyads, these numbers should be considered as "centers
    of gravity," modal estimates in a range roughly plus or minus a
    third of the number.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------

25. There may be multiple proper functions, but for clarity and
simplicity, one per configuration will do for this discussion. The dyad
affords possibilities for micro-coordination (e.g., facial imitation in
a mother-infant dyad, the automatic adjustment of gait that occurs when
two people walk together); the workgroup affords possibilities for
distributed cognition; the face-to-face group affords a shared,
construction of reality ("common knowledge"), which also mediates
interaction in macrodemes and other superordinate group configurations.
Macrodemes afford the stabilization and standardization of language,
signs and symbols. Higher-level configurations cannot be reduced to
lower-level configurations, but once a proper function is available
from higher-level configurations, it may be usefully employed in
lower-level configurations. For example, there is no reason to propose
that language evolved "for" dyadic interaction. However, once language
has evolved, it can be used in dyadic interactions.

26. Human core configurations are also repeatedly assembled in an
ontogenetic sequence. Infants develop microcoordination in dyads; as
their coordination increases, they participate in workgroups
(families), and through them, face-to-face groups (extended networks of
kin, family friends, etc.). Rather than just independence, human
development is increasing interdependence. There is a broadening of the
range of social interaction accompanied by increasing requirements for
reciprocity, skills, memory, social judgment and so on.

VII. DUAL PERSPECTIVE IN CORE CONFIGURATIONS 

27. Psychological research on humans also suggests a nested
hierarchical organization for social identity. Social identity plays
an important role in ingroup-outgroup relations, the distribution of
resources, self-categorization, and expectations for behavior. It is an
automatic redefinition of "self" in terms of shared group membership
(Brewer, 1991; Turner, 1987). To go back to Adam Smith's period, the
brewer works in a small group for brewing; he is also a member of a
guild, a village, and so on. Each of these may be distinct social
identities, posing different conflicts and synergisms. Social identity
is more complicated for many people in the modern world because they
potentially belong to multiple "lineages" of groups: the modern brewer
may also be a member of an environmental activist organization, which
may be a chapter in a larger organization, which may be part of a
federation of environmentalist groups. Is there a way of bringing
together, from the one side, a vision of evolution as hierarchical,
repeatedly assembled levels of organization, and from the other, a line
of empirical research on the hierarchical organization of human social
identity?

28. I propose that the topography for the evolution of human relations
and practice is simultaneously social-organizational and cognitive.
Dynamic psychological shifts in level of identity (which can result
from various conditions including group size, shared fate or outcomes,
and salient group boundaries; Turner, 1987) are hypothesized to
maintain core configurations even when the physical constraints of time
and space are reduced, as for groups of globally dispersed individuals
linked by telecommunications technology.

29. Another way of saying this is that configuration units are
group-level entities having proper functions. Their psychological
correlates, that is, how they are cognitively maintained and repeatedly
assembled, are redefinitions of "self" that minimize distinctions
between self and others (Brewer, 1991). Thus, from one perspective, the
"skin-bounded" organism consists of multiple selves; from another
perspective, the skin bounded organism is "dissolved" into multiple
individuals, that is, units of coordinated activity. Personal identity,
the locus of conscious awareness of goals, plans and beliefs, is the
product of multiple interacting and dynamic selves. These are two
perspectives of the same phenomena (similar to the way that light can
be described as waves or packets depending on one's perspective).

30. This unfamiliar way of thinking about social cognitive phenomena
can be intuitively illustrated: five people in an elevator are an
aggregation, not a group; that is, they are not a core configuration.
The same five people stuck in the elevator between floors are a group
(core configuration), the "glue" being shared fate. When group
identity is salient, personal identity is not. Although we can access
the experience of self at different levels of organization, it is, in
effect, partially encapsulated.

31. Some reviewers complain that by introducing a dual perspective, I
have not completely dashed dualism. That was not my objective: some
minimal dualism is essential because without it, we have no way of
conceptualizing (or perceiving) contrasts. I have relocated the
panoply of dualisms that we tacitly assume exist in nature
(nature-nurture, individual-society, etc.) and put them in the
researcher's project, where they properly belong; have been all the
time; and -- when placed into nature -- have caused no end of confusion
and dispute among realists and relativists. 

VIII. CORE CONFIGURATIONS AND IDENTITY LEVELS IN ACTION

32. Once a proper function, associated with a core configuration,
evolves, it can be extended to other domains of interaction; that is,
it can become part of another behavioral assembly. For example, dyadic
micro-coordination (involving perception of movement dynamics,
emotional expressiveness, etc., whose proper function probably includes
sex and infant-elder interactions) can be extended to interaction
between animal trainer and animal, and human and artifact (where it
becomes the basis for embodied knowledge, tinkering or highly skilled
performance). Language is one of the most salient examples of
extension, having both upward and downward causal effects, although
these do not seem to be equivalent. Language has considerable impact
on band-size humans, and largely allows modern humans to be members of
multiple macrodemes presumably an innovation in recent history.
Nevertheless, the proper function of macrodemes persists. Various fields
of work, from dog grooming to biochemistry, have specialized languages,
and one purpose of professional meetings is to standardize terms and
references that have no ordinary usage. Though language is still
important for workgroups, these smaller groups rely more than higher
level groups on gesture, visual aids, and "private language" for
telegraphing information. The rhythmic features of language, more than
content, are probably significant in microcoordination.

33. With an appropriate bridge, proper functions specialized for one
level of organization may be evoked at others. The rhythm of a
marching band, for example can generate microcoordination among
hundreds of marchers. We would not expect the evolution of a capacity,
"group-marching ability" to evolve for marching in large groups, as
there is no reason to suppose that either large groups or marching
bands (or an equivalent) were repeatedly assembled until recently in
human history. Technology, crucial for achieving agriculture and
settlement life, also bridges domains of application and the
psychological correlates of coordination, particularly where technology
eliminates the constraints of time and space that have traditionally
characterized human social organization (Caporael, 1987). We "reach
out and touch someone" thousands of miles away by using a telephone.
Radio and television can be used to extend group identity to millions
of people by invoking national category boundaries rather than ethnic,
religious, or professional ones.

34. Specialized affordances may be combined (e.g., a heart surgery
team combines affordances for microcoordination and distributed
cognition). There may be other recognizable configurations for human
activity in addition to core ones, but all human action, and all
selective action at the organism environment level, is situated in
group contexts plus the solitary or individuated state (e.g., being
alone in a crowd). For analytic purposes, affordances can be
decomposed. Piloting an airplane involves highly evolved
microcoordinative abilities, and, counterintuitively, would not be
evolutionarily novel. Getting into an airplane -- sharing a small
contained space with hundreds of strangers -- is evolutionarily novel.

IX. AN EXAMPLE: SCIENTISTS AND FORAGERS

35. David Hull (1988) provides an excellent description of scientific
organization that can be used to illustrate how repeated assembly, core
configurations, and their psychological correlates could be used. He
proposed that scientists competed for citations, priority, and
recognition, but they had to cooperate to achieve their ends. He also
saw that the social organization of science, its demic structure, was
very important. My interest here is to use his excellent observations
to illustrate an analogy between the demic structure of science and
that of traditional societies.

36. Hull (1988) identified a scientific demic structure consisting of
the individual scientist, research groups, "conceptual demes," and
seasonal society meetings. These correspond to the typical organization
among nomadic hunter gatherer groups: a nested hierarchy composed of
work groups, microbands, and seasonal macrobands (Jarvenpa & Brumbach,
1988). To these configurations, we must add the dyad. In both instances
-- in science and among hunter-gatherers -- group-size numbers at these
four levels are fairly constant; dyads, about 3-5 individuals, 30-50
individuals, and 100-500 individuals (Birdsell, 1972; Hull, 1988). In
both cases, isolates have reduced viability, and must be part of a
subgroup with sufficient "critical mass" to persist. As Hull noted,
isolated scientists are not very productive. Also, scientists do not
usually begin a new research group as social isolates; they must bring
some of the old group members with them or attract new recruits.

37. Learning to fashion specialized tools, in stone or other materials,
or to use specialized laboratory or food preparation equipment and
skills is a hands-on, situated activity (like golf or tennis) requiring
feedback from materials, equipment, and an experienced user to develop
finely-tuned sensory-motor microcoordination. The most intense
conceptual interaction with the material environment occurs in
workgroups, the activities of which are influenced by the microband
(conceptual deme) and feed back into it. Small research groups or
intensely social small hunter-gather groups working on the environment
seem to do two things. They distribute cognition; that is, they share
tasks such as perception, classification, inference, memory, and
contextually-cued responses in the conduct of practice and
interpretation of data, or in interaction with uncertain habitat
features. In the process of doing so, they draw on and contribute to a
socially constructed and shared "world-view," which permits groups
(hunter-gatherers or scientists) to interface with nature (cf. Jacobs
and Campbell, 1961; Amann & Knorr-Cetina, 1990).

38. The product of that interface feeds into higher levels in the group
system. Bands and conceptual demes are "staging communities" (Jarvenpa,
1993), which serve as "general processing and maintenance centers" for
information and resources retrieved from the smaller dispersed groups;
they are also loci of shared group identity. For both scientists and
hunter-gatherers, seasonal macroband meetings (or yearly conventions)
are important for the exchange of myths, gossip, and information about
more distant areas and groups. Macrobands are also arenas for
competitive games as well as the affirmation of common worldviews, the
maintenance of languages (hunter-gatherers) and idiolects (scientists),
and the exchange of people (mates, new PhDs, or disgruntled members).
For science, unlike hunter-gatherer groups, the production of articles
in journals may find their way into the popular press and eventually be
incorporated as "common knowledge" (e.g., almost everyone believes in
atoms, germs, and innate sex differences), which remains unsituated
(e.g., atoms) or is realized in interaction (e.g., sex differences).

39. The correspondence between these two demic structures, scientists
and hunter-gatherers, suggests some counterintuitive hypotheses:
divergence in scientific ideas may not lead to fissioning;
fissioning or rather too large a group size may lead to divergence in
scientific ideas (or, alternatively, bureaucratic suppression of
productivity in too large a group). Likewise, the common practice in
academic departments to hire faculty for coverage of a discipline may
come at the cost of having critical mass for effective research
groups.

X. SUPERORDINATE COORDINATION 

40. The system of meanings and practice implied by terms like "culture"
or "society," must be realized in specific organism environment
interaction, which becomes increasingly elaborated during development.
Superordinate coordination partitions the "blooming, buzzing confusion"
of situated activity into conventionally shared, orderly descriptions.
These in turn influence situated activity. Such interactions result
from, and contribute to, specialized domains of repeatedly assembled
belief, knowledge, and practice, such as those distinguishing between
sexes, generational cohorts, technical specialties and cultures.

41. For example, a young child may be puttering around in the kitchen
"mixing stuff," as children typically do, but a boy's mixing is more
likely to be described by adults as evidence for an incipient interest
in "chemistry" and a girl's as incipient interest in "cooking." For
both children the situated activity is the same. Yet the adults'
description of activity, based on common cultural assumptions, is
different. One child is directed to ponder a future career, the other a
future meal.

42. Coordination occurs to the extent that knowledge and practice 
domains overlap or are complementary. I suggest that values serve as a
medium. Humans live in a value-saturated environment; values are known
from interactions with people, natural objects, and artifacts, all of
which interact with social life and customs in complex ways (Caporael,
Panichkul & Harris, 1993; Merchant, 1980).

43. The word "values" tends to trouble psychologists. I am not
suggesting there exists a set of unalterable "shoulds," moral
provisions, or ethics that can be revealed by biology or the
neurosciences. By values, I am referring to the evaluative
(positive/negative) dimension of aggregate social preferences, usually
tacit and invisible, shared by members of a community, diagnostic of
shared social identity, and, to some interesting extent, channelling
behavior in some directions and away from others.

44. Values could not play a coordinative role unless they were both
accessible and automatic. Accessibility allows tacit values to be
exposed and used to negotiate new prescriptive values. Automaticity is
critical; values could not serve coordinating functions if we always
had to contemplate them before acting. We should, therefore, expect a
tradeoff or compromise between values (for coordination) and
experience (of situated activity), which in turn should result in a
discrepancy between actual experience and the description of it.

45. Obviously, humans can describe situated activity, but the
circumstances for doing so are rather rare (e.g., a radio sportscaster
delivering a "real time" description of a baseball game, a field
researcher gathering "real time" observations of animal or human
behavior). Instead, people summarize experience or concatenate it, in
widely shared, conventional ways. These descriptions are not just a
shorthand, expandable to a full description of behavior. People are
often unaware of their actual experience, and instead they describe it
in terms of widely-shared expectations (Nisbett & Ross, 1980).
Descriptions of other people's behavior is often no more precise. Even
a very short time delay can produce descriptions of behavior that
correspond more highly to measures of conventional linguistic meaning
than to actual observed behaviors (Shweder & D'Andrade, 1980).
Expectancy effects can result in self-fulfilling prophecies about
others' behavior (Eccles, Jacobs & Harold, 1990; Rosenthal & Jacobson,
1968), as well as structure access to physical spaces, knowledge and
objects (Caporael, Panichkul & Harris, 1993). Research on eyewitness
testimony, self-description, social judgment, causal attributions, as
well as other social psychological phenomena, suggest that
discrepancies between actual behavior and descriptions of behavior may
be quite common. Because cognition is considered to be fundamentally
"asocial," these phenomena are typically explained in terms of
side-effects of a tradeoff between accuracy and cognitive efficiency
rather than between accuracy and sociality.

46. The discrepancy between situated activities and their conventional
descriptions allows perception and talk to function in the production
of coordinated activity despite the novelty of every living moment. At
least two interacting psychological systems appear to be involved in
superordinate coordination. One is based on folk psychology as
"value-making" talk and the other, following Hodges & Baron (1992), is
based on perception (of objects, people, things) as "value-realizing"
(Hodges & Baron, 1992). Both systems would operate in face-to-face
groups, but easily extend for higher levels of coordination.

47. Psychologists and philosophers have extensively debated the role of
folk psychology as an adequate or heuristically useful description of
human cognition (Greenwood, 1991). However, the prescriptive content of
folk psychology (e.g., the evaluative dimensions of trait terms)
suggests another interpretation. Folk psychological talk about beliefs,
intentions, and desires -- including judgments concerning which are
"natural" and which are not -- develops a context for action that
limits and entrains which actions are conceivable, possible, 
desirable, essential, tolerated and forbidden. Folk psychology can serve 
for making heuristic predictions of behavior because, to some extent, it
produces the behavior it predicts. The coordination involved is not
simply directing behavior (as in the sense implied by norms), but in
its social cognitive construction.

48. Like folk psychology, perception itself can also tacitly limit the
conceivable, possible, desirable and essential. When presented with a
stimulus, humans are capable of judging whether or not they like it
even if they cannot identify it -- evidence of the primacy of value in
perception (Zajonc, 1980). Moreover, such evaluations correlate with
prior exposure to a stimulus: familiarity breeds liking. Hodges and
Baron (1992) go beyond the notion of values as preference. They argue
that values are criterial and embodied in public, objective
affordances. This view allows that perception can be coordinative on
a large scale. For example, a simple artifact such as a toddler's
spouted cup, is weighted on the bottom to discourage spilling and
encourage drinking (the dual affordances of a cup filled with liquid).
It also connotes a value on independence and self-sufficiency
consistent with a culture with early weaning and training for
independence (Hodges & Baron, 1992). The device, which is only one of
many possible designs for transporting liquids to the mouth,
contributes to the direction of parents' child-rearing activity,
influences the child's development, and reverberates through the
culture, constraining other activities. Most Americans would
disapprove of a woman breast-feeding a two-year old toddler, even in
private, although it is common in nonindustrial cultures and was
throughout human evolutionary history. In perception, "the social"
actively interacts with "the material" through the translation of value
in situated interaction (cf. Pacey, 1983).

XI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

49. The descriptive paradigm presented in this article is preliminary;
it is a target to shoot down, a thesis to test. Flaws that are
invisible to me shout for recognition from critics, and much more
empirical and conceptual work remains. My claim is that, in a
fundamental sense, the natural environment of humans has not
dramatically changed. It is maintained by social/cognitive mechanisms
and a structure of activity through which humans "parse" the stimulus
information of complex environments into a small-group "grammar"
throughout the lifespan (Caporael, 1987). The persistence of nested
demic structure, in industrial as well as hunter-gatherer societies,
the existence of novel, cross-cutting "bureaucratic" organization
(typically indifferent to issues of group size and task structure), and
now, the existence of groups unsituated in space and time, linked
through email, fax, phone, and "groupware" provide unprecedented
opportunities for both pure and applied investigations by
evolutionarily-oriented researchers.

50. Although I have stressed sociality, almost as a synonym for
coordination, I am not claiming that human cognition is always a
group-level process: individual cognition is an important source of
variability. Sociality theory most definitely is not a claim that
humans are basically altruistic, prosocial or selfless. I have not
denied that humans can be self-interested, competitive, altruistic,
individualistic or intentional, as the case may be. However, these
terms may be less useful as analytic categories for science than they
are for the critical function of negotiating, coordinating, and
constructing the human social environment (Caporael, 1994). If there is
a distinction, as I have argued, between the "real-time" description of
situated activity and the conveyance of expectation (value) through
unsituated descriptions, there may be a genuine failure to discriminate
between scientific activity as a description of human nature from
scientific activity as the construction of human nature. If this is
the case, then there may be no transcendental "human nature," but only
historical sequences of descriptive paradigms, of which self-interest
and sociality are two, comparable in their generativity more than in
their truth value.

51. Whether repeated assembly is of any value to biologists depends to
a large extent on how useful and appropriable it is for the study of
other species and the development of evolutionary theory. To the extent
that genotype and phenotype can be collapsed into a single unit of
analysis for some research purposes, repeated assembly will likely be
an unnecessarily complicated description of evolution. Still, this
rephrasing seems to pose a challenge -- to recent notions, at least. One 
is the interactor/replicator distinction (Hull, 1988), which divides
entities (or their attributes) into those things that interact and
those that replicate. Repeated assembly, coordinated over levels of
organization, implies that repeated interaction is replication, or at
least the source of replication. Similarly, there has been a trend to
divide evolution into two domains of inquiry: the process of evolution
and the results of evolution (Reeve & Sherman, 1993). If organisms (and
other entities) are the continuation of evolutionary processes, than
process and product are indistinguishable; the durability of repeated
assemblies, or repeated assemblies nested in other repeated assemblies,
replaces the process-product distinction.

NOTES

1. The term "deme" comes from the Greek word, demos, referring to
district, and it is used in biology to refer to a breeding population.
Interestingly, in ancient Athens, there was a law requiring a citizen
to use his deme name rather than his family name. The explicit reason
for this requirement was to foster ties with fellow citizens over kin.

        OSCAR and the OSCAR MANUAL are now available by anonymous ftp from
aruba.ccit.arizona.edu in the directory /ftp/pub/oscar.  Alternatively,
they can be downloaded from the OSCAR Home Page at
http://aruba.ccit.arizona.edu/oscar.html.  OSCAR is a programmable
architecture for rational agents, based upon a general-purpose deductive
and defeasible reasoner.  The high-level theory upon which OSCAR is based
is described in detail in John Pollock's new book COGNITIVE CARPENTRY, just
published by MIT Press.  The low-level theory is detailed in the OSCAR
MANUAL.  The high-level theory is a general theory of rationality,
comprising both epistemic rationality and practical rationaltiy (planning
and acting).  The low-level theory concerns the structure of the reasoning
implemented in OSCAR.  As a deductive reasoner, OSCAR is a natural
deduction system that is complete for the predicate calculus.  In
comparison with other automated reasoners for the predicate calculus, OSCAR
is noteworthy for its efficiency.  The defeasible reasoner is built on top
of the deductive reasoner, in the manner described in COGNITIVE CARPENTRY,
and can be used as a standalone reasoner or as part of a general agent
architecture.  This is the only existent automated defeasible reasoner that
is both provably i.d.e-adequate (in the sense defined in COGNITIVE
CARPENTRY) and capable of reasoning against the background of an
undecidable logic like the predicate calculus.
        The OSCAR architecture runs in Common LISP, on Mac, DOS, Windows,
or UNIX machines.  It has a transparent user-interface that allows novice
LISPer's to use it satisfactorily.  Standalone versions are planned that
can run without having LISP available, but they have not yet been produced.
        The OSCAR architecture is designed to be used for experimentation
in agent-building.  OSCAR can provide the testbed for theories of epistemic
reasoning formulated in terms of OSCAR's system of defeasible reasoning,
and for realistic theories of practical reasoning that similarly take
defeasibility seriously.  For example, the OSCAR Lab is currently using
OSCAR to develop a system of defeasible probabilistic reasoning based upon
the theory developed in Pollock's book NOMIC PROBABILITY AND THE
FOUNDATIONS OF INDUCTION (Oxford, 1990).  OSCAR also provides the
inference-engine for a system of decision-theoretic planning currently
under development by the OSCAR Lab.

                THE BASE RATE FALLACY RECONSIDERED:
        DESCRIPTIVE, NORMATIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES

     ABSTRACT: We have been oversold on the base rate fallacy in
     probabilistic judgment from an empirical, normative, and
     methodological standpoint. First, contrary to the conventional
     wisdom, a thorough examination of the literature reveals that base
     rates are almost always used and that their degree of use depends
     on task structure and internal task representation. Second, few
     tasks map unambiguously into the simple, narrow framework that is
     held up as the standard of good decision making. Third, the
     current approach is criticized for its failure to consider how the
     ambiguous, unreliable and unstable base rates of the real world
     should be used in the informationally rich and criterion-complex
     natural environment. A more ecologically valid research program is
     called for.

     AIMS AND FOCUS
     --------------
     Theory & Psychology is an international journal for theoretical and 
     meta-theoretical analysis in psychology. It focuses on the emergent 
     themes  at the centre of contemporary psychological debate. Its 
     principal aim is to foster theoretical dialogue and innovation within 
     the discipline, serving as an integrative role for a wide 
     psychological audience.
     
     Theory & Psychology publishes scholarly and expository papers which 
     explore significant theoretical developments within and across such 
     specific sub-areas as: cognitive, social, personality, developmental, 
     clinical, perceptual or biological psychology. It also publishes, and 
     particularly encourages, work within a broader meta-theoretical 
     intent, examining such issues as the conceptual frameworks and 
     foundations of psychology, its historical underpinnings, its relation 
     to other human sciences, its methodological commitments, its 
     ideological assumptions and its political and institutional contexts. 
     
     Interdisciplinary analysis addressing psychological topics are 
     welcomed. These may include (but are not limited to) the philosophy of 
     science and psychology,m cognition and intentionality, forms of 
     explanation in psychology, criteria of theory evaluation, the social 
     basis of psychological knowledge, the history of psychological 
     theories and methods, the utilisation of psychological knowledge, 
     critical theory and methods of psychology, feminist theory and methods 
     in psychology, and rhetoric and argumentation in psychological theory

News from the IPPE -- 7 Mar 95
==============================


--------------------------------
World Wide Web access redesigned
-------------------------------- In support of the mission of the 
International Philosophical Preprint Exchange to facilitate the exchange
of working papers between philosophers world-wide, Carolyn Burke of the
IPPE has recently redesigned our World Wide Web access, making it much
easier to use, and enabling philosophers to locate papers of interest to
them in the IPPE's collection with greater ease than ever before.

The IPPE's World Wide Web service supplements the previous methods of
access via Gopher, ftp, and automated email (see the end of this
newsletter for details on all these access methods).

The IPPE's WWW service is available by opening the URL
http://phil-preprints.L.chiba-u.ac.jp/IPPE.html using Netscape, Mosaic,
Lynx, or any other WWW browser (we recommend Netscape).


-------------
Status Report
------------- The IPPE continues to enjoy a rate of access of
over 100 users per day at our main site in Japan.  Additional
accesses to the many North American and European sites mirroring the
IPPE collection probably greatly exceed this number, but are difficult
to quantify.

In addition, the rate of submissions to the IPPE has climbed steeply in
recent weeks.  We are delighted by this trend, and encourage all
philosophers to submit their manuscripts to the IPPE in order to benefit
from the commentary of their peers.


-------------------
Call for Volunteers
------------------- The IPPE seeks motivated and enthuiastic volunteers
to assist in the areas of administration, publicity, and technical
support.  We especially seek persons able to carry out some or all of
the following tasks:
  - liason with the IPPE's international user population of professional
    philosophers, graduate students, the editorial staffs of
    philosophical journals, and the staffs of other on-line projects
    in the humanities and social sciences
  - editorial work on the newsletter and publicity materials
  - administrative activities (regarding funding, etc.)
  - computer support work: UNIX and CGI scripting and related activities.


--------------
The IPPE Staff
--------------
Coordinators:  Dr. Syun Tutiya (Chiba University) and Dr. Richard Reiner
	       (visiting in '95 at the Center for Philosophy of Science,
	       University of Pittsburgh).
Adminstrator:  Carolyn L Burke (CMU).
Board members: Dr. George Gale (University of Missouri, Kansas City), Andrew
	       Burday (McGill University), Istvan Berkeley (University of
	       Alberta), Stephen Rice (York University).

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:
Perhaps the most famous criticism of traditional Artificial
Intelligence is that computer programs use symbols that are arbitrarily
interpretable (see Searle, 1980 for the Chinese Room and Harnad, 1990
for the symbol grounding problem). We could, for example, use the word
"apple" to mean anything from a "common fruit" to a "pig's nose". All
the computer knows is the relationship between this symbol and the
others that we have given it. The question is, how is it possible to
move from this notion of meaning, as the relationship between arbitrary
symbols, to  a notion of "intrinsic" meaning. In other words, how do we
provide meaning by grounding computer symbols or representations in the
physical world?

The aim of this colloquium is to take a broad  look at many of the
important issues in relating machine intelligence to the world and to
make accessible some of the most recent research in integrating
information   from  different modalities.    For   example, why is  it
important to have symbol or  representation grounding and what is  the
role of the emerging neural network technology?

One approach  has  been to   link  intelligence to  the sensory  world
through visual systems or robotic devices. Another approach is work on
systems that integrate information  from different modalities such  as
vision and language. Yet another approach has  been to examine how the
human brain  relates sensory, motor and  other  information.  It looks
like we may  be at long last  getting a handle  on the age old CHINESE
ROOM and SYMBOL GROUNDING problems.   Hence this colloquium has as its
focus, "grounding representations.

The colloquium will occur over one day and will focus on three themes:
(1) Biology and  development; (2) Computational  models and (3) Symbol
grounding.

The  target audience  of this colloquium  will   include Engineers and
Scientists  in    Neural  Networks  and     Artificial   Intelligence,
Developmental Psychologists,   Cognitive  Scientists, Philosophers  of
mind, Biologists and  all  of those  interested in the  application of
Artificial Intelligence to real world problems.

Over the coming weeks, there will be a symposium on Roger Penrose's
recent book SHADOWS OF THE MIND in the electronic journal PSYCHE.
There will be ten review articles discussing the issues raised by the book
from a variety of perspectives, and Penrose will reply.  Authors of
the review articles are:

Bernard Baars:    Psychology, The Wright Institute, Berkeley
David Chalmers:   Philosophy, Washington University

RATIONAL AGENCY: CONCEPTS, THEORIES, MODELS, AND APPLICATIONS

This symposium explores conceptions of rational agency and their
implications for theory, research, and practice. The view that intelligent
systems are, or ought to be, rational agents underlies much of the theory
and research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. However, no
consensus exists on a proper view of agency or rationality principles for
practical agents.

Traditionally agents are presumed disposed toward purposive action.
However, agent theories abound in which behavior is fundamentally reactive.
Some theories emphasize agents' abilities to manage private belief systems.
Others focus on agents' interactions with their environment, sometimes
including other agents. Application builders have recently broadened the
term "agent" to mean any embedded system performing tasks to support human
users.

Rationality accounts are equally diverse. Rationality involves having
reasons warranting particular beliefs (epistemic rationality) or particular
desires and actions (strategic or practical rationality). Many agent models
propose epistemic rationality criteria such as logical consistency or
consequential closure. Other agent models base practical rationality on
classical or non-monotonic logics for reasoning about action. Such logicist
views are now being challenged by decision theoretic accounts emphasizing
optimal action under uncertainty, including recent work on decision
theoretic principles of metareasoning for limited rationality.

Our symposium will explore the diverse views of rational agency. Through
informal presentations and group discussion, participants will critically
examine agency concepts and rationality principles, review computational
agent models and applications, and consider promising directions for future
work on this topic.

Submission Information

Prospective participants should submit a brief paper (5 pages or less)
describing their research in relation to any of the following questions:

      Is rationality important; must an agent be rational to be successful?
      What are suitable principles of epistemic, strategic, and limited
     rationality?
      Are rationality principles applicable to retrospective processes such
     as learning?
      What are general requirements on rational agent architectures?
      How, if at all, must a model of rational agency be modified to
     account for social, multi-agent interaction?

Those wishing to make a specific presentation should describe its contents
in their concept paper.

Note: While we recognize that our topic lends itself to formal analysis, we
also encourage discussion of experimental work with implemented agents.

Postscript files of concept papers should be sent by email only to the
program chair,
fehling@lis.stanford.edu

                 EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: May 3, 1995


1.  Description

This symposium explores conceptions of rational agency and their implications
for theory, research, and practice.  The view that intelligent systems are, or
ought to be, rational agents underlies a good deal of the theory and research
in artificial intelligence and related disciplines. However, consensus has yet
to be reached on a proper view of agency and rationality principles for
practical agents.

  Traditionally agents are presumed disposed toward purposive, goal-directed
actions.  However, alternative theories abound in which agent behavior is
portrayed as fundamentally reactive.  Some theories focus on agents' abilities
to embody and manipulate private systems of belief.  Other theories depict
agents' abilities to interact overtly with their environment and sometimes
with other agents.  Application builders have recently broadened the term
"agent" as referring to any embedded system performing tasks in support of
human users.

  Rationality accounts are equally diverse.  Rationality involves having
reasons that warrant particular beliefs (epistemic rationality) or
particular desires and actions (strategic or practical rationality).  Many
models of agency embrace such logical standards as consistency,
consequential closure, or soundness for epistemic rationality.  Other agent
models depict practical rationality as based on some classical or
non-monotonic logic for reasoning about action.  Such logicist views of
rational agency are now being challenged by decision theoretic models
emphasizing optimal choice of actions under uncertainty.  This includes
recent work on decision theoretic principles of limited rationality.

  We invite researchers with an active interest in the concept of rational
agency.  Relying upon a mixture of informal presentation and group
discussion, participants will critically examine agency concepts and
rationality principles, review computational agent models and applications,
and explore opportunities for future work on this topic.

2.  Submission Information

Those interested in participating should submit a concept paper of no more
than five pages describing their work in relation to any of the following
questions:

        *  Is rationality important; must an agent be rational to be
           successful?
        *  What are suitable principles of epistemic, strategic, or limited
           rationality?
        *  Are rationality principles applicable to retrospective processes
           such as learning?
        *  What, if any, are the general requirements on rational agent
           architectures?
        *  How, if at all, must a model of rational agency be modified to
           account for social, multi-agent interaction?

  Those wishing to make a specific presentation should outline its contents
in their concept paper.  NOTE: While we recognize that our topic lends
itself to formal analysis, we also encourage discussion of experimental
work with implemented agents.

EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE:  The deadline for receipt of concept papers
  has been extended to Wednesday, May 3, 1995.

  Concept papers must be emailed to the committee chair, Michael Fehling.
His email address is fehling@lis.stanford.edu.  Please send your paper as
either
plain ascii text or as a postscript file.

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

translation of the ZIP archive containing that version has 275630 only.
Beware that your e_mail service may be unable to deliver the huge
uuencoded but uncompressed version. (Future issues will -- we hope -- be
smaller.)

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

      WARNING!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notice that the .txt (pure-ASCII) version of issue #01 of SORITES has
416588 bytes; the uuencoded translation of the uncompressed official
WordPerfect 5.1 version has 901032 bytes; whereas the uuencoded
translation of the ZIP archive containing that version has 275630 only.
Beware that your e_mail service may be unable to deliver the huge
uuencoded but uncompressed version. (Future issues will -- we hope -- be
smaller.)

the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-

(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an

has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

Notice that the .txt (pure-ASCII) version of issue #01 of SORITES has

translation of the ZIP archive containing that version has 275630 only.
Beware that your e_mail service may be unable to deliver the huge
uuencoded but uncompressed version. (Future issues will -- we hope -- be
smaller.)

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

Notice that the .txt (pure-ASCII) version of issue #01 of SORITES has

translation of the ZIP archive containing that version has 275630 only.
Beware that your e_mail service may be unable to deliver the huge
uuencoded but uncompressed version. (Future issues will -- we hope -- be
smaller.)

version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

(4) In order to preserve the interests of the authors -- the electronic
publisher, ``colectivo SORITES'', being a non-profit organization -- the
journal has been duly and fully copyrighted. An official statement reminds
the readers and users that SORITES is not in the public domain, and that,
in accordance with international Law, every issue of SORITES is Copyright-
protected throughout the Planet. Every issue of SORITES is legally
registered, three diskette-copies being deposited with the competent
authorities. But of course SORITES is free for everybody to download, or
read, provided they make a fair use thereof. SORITES may be freely
displayed, circulated, reproduced IN ITS ENTIRETY (with no omissions, esp.
without omitting the copyright notice and the copyright boxes on top of
each article) by anybody provided no fee is charged.

                     ***   ***   ***
(5) Thanks to the existence of the official, WordPerfect-formatted
version, there is also an official or standard pagination, which allows
anybody to quote a paper published in SORITES in accordance with such an
official pagination, independently of whether or not their own print-out
of the files they have downloaded change the numbers of pages. Each paper
has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

                     ***   ***   ***

Notice that the .txt (pure-ASCII) version of issue #01 of SORITES has

WordPerfect 5.1 version has 901032 bytes; whereas the uuencoded
translation of the ZIP archive containing that version has 275630 only.
Beware that your e_mail service may be unable to deliver the huge
uuencoded but uncompressed version. (Future issues will -- we hope -- be
smaller.)

has on top of it a copyright inbox which shows the official pagination,
which is the one that must be quoted. Notice that, in accordance with the
copyright notice, it is mandatory, when quoting papers appeared in
SORITES, to clearly acknowledge the issue of SORITES, its ISSN, the date,
the author, and the paper's title and pages.

There has been a flurry of error-messages this morning, apparently
due to a message announcing the new electronic journal SORITES.
I am not sure what specifics have caused this. Addressing-errors
appear to be coming back not only to spp-request (as they
should) but also to the originating sorities address that is
then forwarding them to spp as a whole, which then forms a
vicious circle...

I am disabling the spp list for the time being (hopefully only for
a day or two).

Apologies for the inconvenience.

****************************ANNOUNCEMENT ********************************

	    Announcing a new electronic mailing list called INDUCTIVE 
			(Inductive Learning Group)

****************************ANNOUNCEMENT ********************************

This mailing list is initiated to provide a separate forum for discussing 
various scientific issues related to INDUCTIVE (LEARNING) PROCESSES. We 
strongly feel that these processes are of central importance to cognitive 
science in general and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, and 
that so far they have not been given the attention and effort they deserve.
Moreover, we feel that the success of the entire enterprise (of cognitive 
science) depends on the success of the effort to model the inductive learning
processes understood sufficiently broadly.

We also believe that the current (and the previous) subdivisions of cognitive
psychology and AI impede (and has impeded) the progress of both
enterprises, since there are serious reasons to believe that all cognitive
processes are built  on top of the inductive learning processes. 

We cordially invite various researchers from the above two disciplines 
(including those working in Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks) to join 
this supervised mailing list.

As a first question we propose to discuss the very definition of the inductive 
learning process: 
 
	Inductive learning is a process by means of which, given a finite
	positive training set C+ from a possibly infinite class (or
	category) C and a finite set C- from the complement of C, an 
	agent is able to reach a state (of inductive generalization) 
	which allows it to form an idea about, and REPRESENTATION of, the
	class C. This state, in turn, enables the agent to recognize a new
	object as belonging to class C or not.

The subscription to this list is free. This list will be moderated and we 
reserve the right to terminate the membership of those members who abuse 
the list. You may subscribe to the list by simply sending the following text

Impasse and Solution.

SHORT DESCRIPTION

The book focuses on a conceptual flaw in contemporary artificial
intelligence and cognitive science.  This conceptual impasse is at best
only partially perceived, but its consequences nevertheless visit
themselves as distortions and failures of multiple research projects -
and make impossible the ultimate aspirations of the fields.

The impasse concerns a presupposition concerning the nature of
representation - that all representation has the nature of encodings:
encodingism.  Encodings certainly exist, but encoding*ism* is at root
logically incoherent; any research predicated on it is doomed to
distortion and failure.

The impasse and its consequences are explored in a large number of
projects and approaches.  These include SOAR, CYC, PDP, situated
cognition, subsumption architecture robotics, and the frame problems
- a general survey of the current research in AI and Cognitive Science
emerges.

Interactivism, an alternative model of representation, is proposed and
examined.



SYNOPSIS

The central point of Foundational Issues in Artificial Intelligence and
Cognitive Science - Impasse and Solution is that there is a conceptual
flaw in contemporary approaches to artificial intelligence and
cognitive science, a flaw that makes impossible the ultimate
aspirations of these fields.  The consequences of this conceptual
impasse are only partially perceived within the fields, but those
consequences nevertheless visit themselves as distortions and
failures of research projects across the fields.

The locus of the impasse concerns a common assumption or
presupposition that underlies all parts of the field - a presupposition
concerning the nature of representation.  We call this assumption
"encodingism", the assumption that representation is fundamentally
constituted as encodings.  This assumption, in fact, has been
dominant throughout Western history.  We argue that it is at root
logically incoherent, and, therefore, that any research predicated on it
is doomed to distortion and failure.  Encodings clearly do exist, and
therefore are clearly possible, and we show how that could be, but
they cannot be the foundational form of representation.

The book characterizes and demonstrates this impasse, discusses a
number of partial recognitions of it, and then traces its consequences
in a large number of projects and approaches within the fields.  These
include SOAR, CYC, PDP, situated cognition, subsumption
architecture robotics, and the frame problems.  In surveying the
consequences of the impasse, we also provide a general survey of
the current research in AI and Cognitive Science per se.

We do not propose an unsolvable impasse, and, in fact, present an
alternative that does resolve that impasse.  This is developed for
contrast, for perspective, to demonstrate that there is an alternative,
and to explore some of its nature.  We end with an exploration of
some of the architectural implications of the alternative - called
interactivism - and argue that such architectures are 1) not subject to
the encodingism incoherence 2) more powerful than Turing
machines, 3) more consistent with properties of central nervous
system functioning than other contemporary approaches, and 4)
capable of resolving the many problematics in the field that we argue
are in fact manifestations of the underlying impasse.

The audience for this book will include researchers, academics, and
students in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, robotics, cognitive
psychology, philosophy of mind and language, natural language
processing, connectionism, and learning.  The focus of the book is on
the nature of representation, and representation permeates
everywhere - so also, therefore, do the implications of our critique and
our alternative permeate everywhere.

PREFACE

Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science are at a foundational
impasse which is at best only partially recognized.  This impasse has
to do with assumptions concerning the nature of representation:
standard approaches to representation are at root circular and
incoherent.  In particular, Artificial Intelligence research and Cognitive
Science are conceptualized within a framework that assumes that
cognitive processes can be modeled in terms of manipulations of
encoded symbols.  Furthermore, the more recent developments of
connectionism and Parallel Distributed Processing, even though the
issue of manipulation is contentious, share the basic assumption
concerning the encoding nature of representation.  In all varieties of
these approaches, representation is construed as some form of
encoding correspondence.  The presupposition that representation is
constituted as encodings, while innocuous for *some applied*
Artificial Intelligence research, is fatal for the further reaching
programmatic aspirations of both Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive
Science.

First, this encodingist assumption constitutes a *presupposition*
about a basic aspect of mental phenomena - representation - rather
than constituting a *model* of that phenomenon.  Aspirations of
Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science to provide any
foundational account of representation are thus doomed to circularity:
the encodingist approach presupposes what it purports to be
(programmatically) able to explain.  Second, the encoding
assumption is not only itself in need of explication and modeling, but,
even more critically, the standard presupposition that representation
is *essentially* constituted as encodings is logically fatally flawed.
This flaw yields numerous subsidiary consequences, both conceptual
and applied.

This book began as an article attempting to lay out this basic critique
at the programmatic level.  Terveen suggested that it would be more
powerful to supplement the general critique with explorations of
actual projects and positions in the fields, showing how the
foundational flaws visit themselves upon the efforts of researchers.
We began that task, and, among other things, discovered that there is
no natural closure to it - there are always more positions that could be
considered, and they increase in number exponentially with time.
There is no intent and no need, however, for our survey to be
exhaustive.  It is primarily illustrative and demonstrative of the
problems that emerge from the underlying programmatic flaw.  Our
selections of what to include in the survey have had roughly three
criteria.  We favored: 1) major and well known work, 2) positions that
illustrate interesting deleterious consequences of the encodingism
framework, and 3) positions that illustrate the existence and power of
moves in the direction of the alternative framework that we propose.
We have ended up, *en passant*, with a representative survey of
much of the field.  Nevertheless, there remain many more positions
and research projects that we would like to have been able to
address.


MAIN FEATURES

Identifies a fundamental premise about the nature of representation
that underlies much of Cognitive Science - that representation is
constituted as encodings.

Explores fatal flaws with this premise.

Surveys major projects within Cognitive Science and Artificial
Intelligence.

Shows how they embody the encodingism premise, and how they are
limited by it.

Identifies movements within Cognitive Science and AI away from
encodingism.

Presents an alternative to encodingism - interactivism.

Demonstrates that interactivism avoids the fatal flaws of
encodingisms, and that it provides a coherent framework for
understanding representation.

Unifies insights from the various movements in Cognitive Science
away from encodingism.

Sketches an interactivist cognitive architecture.

Persons planning to attend the June 1995 Society for Philosophy and
Psychology meeting at Stony Brook, June 8-11, and who require
accommodations NEED TO MAKE THEIR RESERVATIONS AT THE PREFERRED OR
ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATIONS PLACES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IT IS UP TO
INDIVIDUALS, WHETHER ON THE PROGRAM OR NOT, TO MAKE THEIR OWN
RESERVATIONS WITH EITHER PLACE.

PREFERRED LODGING closest to the conference site and local eateries is
available at newly refurbished student dormitories.  Dorms are set up in
suites of three bedrooms.  Rates:  room for one, $39 per night; room for
two, $28 per nigth per person; children under seve, free in parents'
room.  $25 key deposit, payable on arrival.  Guaranteed reservation time
has past, so please make reservations as soon as possible.  NOTE:  it is
not possible to make reservations by telephone.  YOU MUST USE THE FORM
ON EITHER THE SPRING OR THE WINTER MAILING (the Dormitory Reservation
Form).  Send that form (with payment) directly to the address listed on
it; do not send that form to the SPP Secretary-Treasurer!
ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATIONS are available at the Holiday Inn Express,
3131 Nesconset Highway, Centereach, NY 11790, three miles from the SUNY
at Stony Brook campus.  No public transportation nor food facility is
available at this location; a/c, but otherwise limited to lodging only.
Conference rate is $68 per night per room, but this rate was only
guaranteed until May 6, and so now will only be available so long as
space is available.  Contact the hotel directly at 516-471-8000 to make
reservations; mention the Society for Philosophy and Psychology to
obtain conference rate.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

> >From the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological and Cognitive Sciences
>
>
> The House Budget Committee has recommended the complete elimination of
> NSF research funding for Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology,
> Linguistics, Political Science, Economics, Geography, Cognitive Science,
> Decision, Risk and Management Sciences, History of Science, and
> Statistical Research for the Behavioral and Social Sciences-- as NSF's
> contribution to balancing the Federal budget.
>
> There is no doubt that NSF funding will be cut in the effort to balance
> the budget.  But to selectively wipe out the behavioral and social
> sciences goes far beyond simply saving money.  This is the most important
> crisis these sciences have faced since Ronald Reagan attempted to
> eliminate the same sciences in the early 1980s.  Action on this will
> happen very quickly.  The Budget Committee approved the budget package on
> May 11.  The vote on the package by the full House will happen sometime
> between the 15th and 18th of May.  In all likelihood, the budget
> resolution will pass the House unaltered.  The Appropriations Committee
> will be bound by the spending limits imposed by the Budget Committee.
> But it need not be bound by the particular cuts recommended by the Budget
> Committee!  Unfortunately, the House leadership has also made it known
> that no program that lacks a current authorization will be funded.  The
> National Science Foundation is not currently authorized.  Efforts to pass
> its authorization failed last year in the Senate.  The House Science
> Committee Chair, Robert Walker (R-PA) has said that as soon as the budget
> is passed, the Science Committee will proceed to report its
> authorizations which include, among other things, NSF, NASA, and the
> research programs of the Department of Energy.  Robert Walker is also the
> Vice-Chair of the Budget Committee, and he played a key role in
> determining the selective cuts at NSF.  In a news conference on May 12,
> Walker said that the Directorate containing the research programs
> mentioned above was created simply because it was "politically correct"
> and that it is now time to make a correction.  This means that there is
> little chance the NSF authorization from his Committee will contain an
> authorization for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences
> Directorate.  If the Committee does not authorize the Directorate, the
> Appropriations Committee cannot fund the research programs it contains.
> So scientists must pay close attention to actions of the Budget,
> Appropriations, and the authorizing committee.
>
> The only way the course of events can be changed is for concerned
> citizens to let their elected representatives know that they as voters to
> not approve of these ideological cuts masquerading as budget balancing
> measures.  You must take it on yourself immediately to
>
> 1)  write or call your own representative and senator's office to express
> your disapproval
>
> 2)  send a copy of your letter to: Robert Walker, George Brown (ranking
> minority member of the Science Committee and a likely ally of behavioral
> and social scientists), Jerry Lewis (Chairman of the House Appropriations
> Subcommittee that appropriates money for the National Science
> Foundation).  And this next thing is equally important:  SEND, FAX OR
> EMAIL A COPY OF YOUR CORRESPONDENCE TO THE FEDERATION OF BEHAVIORAL,
> PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES.  We have to be able to monitor how
> great an impact behavioral and social scientists are having, and the only
> way we can do that is by keeping track of how many contacts from
> scientists congressional offices have received.  Any letter to Congress
> may be addressed as follows:  Representative's name, U.S. House of
> Representatives (or U.S. Senate) Washington, D.C. 20515 (House) or 20510
> (Senate).  The Federation email is federation@apa.org.  Federation fax is
> (202) 336-6158.  If you need more information, our telephone number is
> (202) 336-5920.
>
> 3)  Help us get the word out.  Please see that the anthropology,
> sociology, linguistics, economics, political science, cognitive science,
> and geography departments on your campus receive this action alert as
> well.
>
> 4)  It is very important that elected representatives do not hear only
> from the scientists affected.  If you have acquaintances in the physical

The archives for the Philosophy/Neuroscience/Psychology program at
Washington University have been reconfigured.  The ftp archive has been
moved from thalamus.wustl.edu (which has been down for a while now), and
more convenient access on the World Wide Web is now in place.

(1) The archive of PNP technical reports is now available by anonymous ftp
to wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory doc/techreports/wustl.edu/philosophy.
Files have the form author.title.format, where format is usually ASCII or PS.
An "INDEX" file contains an index with abstracts.  Plenty of new papers here!

(2) There is now a PNP home page on the WWW, at
http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~philos/pnp.html.  At the moment this serves
mostly as a gateway to the PNP archive, but more will be appearing shortly.
Those with WWW access will probably want to use this to get to the archive,
rather than the ftp option.

(3) My own home page is now set up at http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~chalmers/.
This has links to a number of my papers on consciousness, content,
artificial intelligence, and other topics (including some papers that
aren't in the PNP archive), and also to my annotated bibliography in the
philosophy of mind (see below).

(4) There is now a convenient home page for my bibliography in the
philosophy of mind at http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~chalmers/biblio.html.
Many of the current links to the bibliography on the net proceed via an
extraordinarily slow connection through apa.oxy.edu and Indiana; this
should work much better.  Incidentally the bibliography is also available
by anonymous ftp to wuarchive in the directory mentioned above, files
chalmers.biblio.*. The current version has about 1830 entries in 5 parts.

Those who maintain pages with links to these things (especially the archive
and the bibliography) might like to update them.

The 16th and last talk in the Southampton University Cognitive Science
Centre's inaugural year's series will be given by Jeff Pullum. It is
the latest development in the hard times on which the beleaguered
Whorf/Sapir Hypothesis has fallen in recent years. For more
information, see the URLs following the abstract. Not all the news
for Whorf is bad...

ESKIMO SNOW VOCABULARY: WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL FACTS?
AND WHAT IMPLICATIONS DO THEY HAVE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CATEGORIZATION?

Geoffrey K. Pullum, University of California, Santa Cruz

ABSTRACT:  An astonishingly large number of both popular and scholarly
sources assert that the Eskimos have an interestingly large number of
words for snow. Yet the claims about how many are all different. So are
the conclusions we are apparently supposed to draw about language and
thought. Laura Martin first drew attention to this in a paper on the
anthropology of anthropologists [American Anthropologist 88.2 (1986)
418-423]. I subsequently published a tongue-in-cheek essay that mocked
linguists for being unaware of her work and generally doing less than
nothing to fight the spread of "The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax" [the
eponymous essay in my 1991 book] --- and have found, to my dismay, that
it now gets cited as research on Eskimo lexicology. But in truth,
although assorted lists of possibly relevant material have appeared on
the LINGUIST mail list and the sci.lang newsgroup, no one has yet
published a linguistic analysis and assessment of the relevant facts,
or attempted to assess the logic of the multitude of morals for our
theories of language and thought that have been implicitly attached to
the supposed facts. In this work-in-progress talk, based on joint
research with Laura Martin, a start is made on this project. The talk
is relatively nontechnical, but departs from most previous work by
actually looking at lexical material from some of the eight Eskimo
languages.

        MEMORY METAPHORS AND THE LABORATORY/REAL-LIFE CONTROVERSY:
        CORRESPONDENCE VERSUS STOREHOUSE VIEWS OF MEMORY

                Department of Psychology
                University of Haifa
                Haifa, Israel
                rsps301@uvm.haifa.ac.il

    KEYWORDS: accuracy, assessment, capacity ecological validity,
    intentionality, memory, metamemory, metaphors, monitoring,
    representation, storehouse, subject control.

    ABSTRACT: The study of memory is witnessing a spirited clash
    between proponents of traditional laboratory research and those
    advocating a more naturalistic approach to the study of
    "everyday" memory. The debate has generally centered on the
    "what" (content), "where" (context), and "how" (methods) of memory
    research. In the present target article, we argue that this
    controversy discloses a further, more fundamental breach between
    two underlying memory metaphors, each having distinct implications
    for memory theory and assessment: Whereas traditional memory
    research has been dominated by the storehouse metaphor, leading to
    a focus on the quantity of items remaining in store, the recent
    wave of everyday memory research discloses a shift towards a
    correspondence metaphor, focusing on the accuracy or faithfulness
    of memory in representing past events. Our analysis shows the
    correspondence metaphor to call for a research approach which
    differs from the traditional approach in important respects: in
    emphasizing the intentional-representational function of memory, in
    addressing the wholistic and graded aspects of memory
    correspondence, in taking an output-bound assessment perspective,
    and in allowing more room for the operation of subject-controlled
    metamemory processes and motivational factors. This analysis can
    help tie together some of the what, where, and how aspects of the
    everyday-laboratory controversy. More importantly, in explicating
    the unique metatheoretical foundation of the accuracy-oriented
    approach to memory, our aim is to promote a more effective
    exploitation of the correspondence metaphor in both naturalistic
    and laboratory research contexts.

    SEXUAL SELECTION AND SEX DIFFERENCES IN MATHEMATICAL ABILITIES

                psycorie@mizzou1.missouri.edu

    KEYWORDS:  sexual selection, sex differences, mathematical
    ability, spatial ability, sex-role stereotypes, social style

    ABSTRACT: The principles of sexual selection were used as an
    organizing framework for interpreting cross-national patterns of
    sex differences in mathematical abilities.  Cross-national
    studies suggest that there are no sex differences in
    biologically primary mathematical abilities, that is, for those
    mathematical abilities that are found pan-culturally, in
    nonhuman primates, and show moderate heritability estimates.
    Sex differences in several biologically secondary mathematical
    domains (i.e., those that emerge primarily in school) are found
    throughout the industrialized world. In particular, males
    consistently outperform females in the solving of mathematical word
    problems and in geometry. Sexual selection and any associated
    proximate mechanisms (e.g., sex hormones) appear to influence these
    sex differences in mathematical performance indirectly. First,
    sexual selection appears to have resulted in the greater
    elaboration of the neurocognitive systems that support navigation
    in 3-dimensional space in males than in females. Knowledge implicit
    in these systems appears to reflect an understanding of basic
    Euclidean geometry, and thus appears to be one source of the male
    advantage in geometry. Males also co-opt these spatial systems in
    problem-solving situations more readily than females, which
    provides males with an advantage in word problems and geometry.
    Moreover, sex differences in social styles and interests, which
    also appear to be related, in part, to sexual selection, result in
    sex differences in engagement in mathematics-related activities,
    which further increases the male advantage in certain mathematical
    domains. A model that integrates these biological influences with
    sociocultural influences on the sex differences in mathematical
    performance is presented.

        MEMORY METAPHORS AND THE LABORATORY/REAL-LIFE CONTROVERSY:
        CORRESPONDENCE VERSUS STOREHOUSE VIEWS OF MEMORY

                Department of Psychology
                University of Haifa
                Haifa, Israel
                rsps301@uvm.haifa.ac.il

    KEYWORDS: accuracy, assessment, capacity ecological validity,
    intentionality, memory, metamemory, metaphors, monitoring,
    representation, storehouse, subject control.

    ABSTRACT: The study of memory is witnessing a spirited clash
    between proponents of traditional laboratory research and those
    advocating a more naturalistic approach to the study of
    "everyday" memory. The debate has generally centered on the
    "what" (content), "where" (context), and "how" (methods) of memory
    research. In the present target article, we argue that this
    controversy discloses a further, more fundamental breach between
    two underlying memory metaphors, each having distinct implications
    for memory theory and assessment: Whereas traditional memory
    research has been dominated by the storehouse metaphor, leading to
    a focus on the quantity of items remaining in store, the recent
    wave of everyday memory research discloses a shift towards a
    correspondence metaphor, focusing on the accuracy or faithfulness
    of memory in representing past events. Our analysis shows the
    correspondence metaphor to call for a research approach which
    differs from the traditional approach in important respects: in
    emphasizing the intentional-representational function of memory, in
    addressing the wholistic and graded aspects of memory
    correspondence, in taking an output-bound assessment perspective,
    and in allowing more room for the operation of subject-controlled
    metamemory processes and motivational factors. This analysis can
    help tie together some of the what, where, and how aspects of the
    everyday-laboratory controversy. More importantly, in explicating
    the unique metatheoretical foundation of the accuracy-oriented
    approach to memory, our aim is to promote a more effective
    exploitation of the correspondence metaphor in both naturalistic
    and laboratory research contexts.

To current SPP members on the SPP e-mail list:

A potential conflict has arisen concerning the meeting time for next
year's SPP annual meeting.  Currently, our meeting dates are June 6-9
(Thursday-Sunday) in San Francisco.  However, the Naturaslized Semantics
conference in Slovenia is scheduled for June 10-15, creating the obvious
potential conflict for some who might wish to attend both.  Therefore,
should the SPP

     (a) continue to hold our meeting June 6-9, hoping that conflicts
         will be few and tolerable

or

     (b) change our meeting dates to May 30-June 2 (Thursday-Sunday),
         resolving potential conflicts with the other conference but
         creating new potential conlicts with members' commencement
         ceremonies, etc?  (Kent Bach, local arrangements person for
         the SF meeting, can arrange for these replacement dates.

TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS POLL:
(1) you must be a current SPP member
(2) (please) you must be seriously considering attending next year's
    meeting
(3) you must get your thoughts/vote to me (see the contact information
    below) by Wednesday afternoon, JULY 5.  (This is because Kent Bach is
    under a tight deadline to change the meeting times.)

Thanks in advance for participating in this poll.

If you have important new findings and ideas in psychology,
neuroscience, cognitive science, or behavioral biology, you are
encouraged to prepare a target article for Psycoloquy. Psycoloquy, the
electronic counterpart of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, offers Open
Peer Commentary that many researchers have found very valuable in
advancing their work, increasing its impact, and encouraging others to
build on it.

Psycoloquy can be accessed in many ways, including the following
Universal Resource Locators (URLs):

   INSTRUCTIONS FOR PSYCOLOQUY AUTHORS AND COMMENTATORS

PSYCOLOQUY is a refereed electronic journal (ISSN 1055-0143) sponsored
on an experimental basis by the American Psychological Association
and currently estimated to reach a readership of 40,000. PSYCOLOQUY
publishes brief reports of new ideas and findings on which the author
wishes to solicit rapid peer feedback, international and
interdisciplinary ("Scholarly Skywriting"), in all areas of psychology
and its related fields (biobehavioral science, cognitive science,
neuroscience, social science, etc.). All contributions are refereed.

Target article length should normally not exceed 500 lines [c. 4500 words].
Commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines [c. 1800 words].

All target articles, commentaries and responses must have (1) a short
abstract (up to 100 words for target articles, shorter for commentaries
and responses), (2) an indexable title, (3) the authors' full name(s)
and institutional address(es).

In addition, for target articles only: (4) 6-8 indexable keywords,
(5) a separate statement of the authors' rationale for soliciting
commentary (e.g., why would commentary be useful and of interest to the
field? what kind of commentary do you expect to elicit?) and
(6) a list of potential commentators (with their email addresses).

All paragraphs should be numbered in articles, commentaries and
responses (see format of already published articles in the PSYCOLOQUY
archive; line length should be < 80 characters, no hyphenation).

It is strongly recommended that all figures be designed so as to be
screen-readable ascii. If this is not possible, the provisional
solution is the less desirable hybrid one of submitting them as
postscript files (or in some other universally available format) to be
printed out locally by readers to supplement the screen-readable text
of the article.

PSYCOLOQUY also publishes multiple reviews of books in any of the above
fields; these should normally be the same length as commentaries, but
longer reviews will be considered as well. Book authors should submit a
500-line self-contained Precis of their book, in the format of a target
article; if accepted, this will be published in PSYCOLOQUY together
with a formal Call for Reviews (of the book, not the Precis). The
author's publisher must agree in advance to furnish review copies to the
reviewers selected.

Authors of accepted manuscripts assign to PSYCOLOQUY the right to
publish and distribute their text electronically and to archive and
make it permanently retrievable electronically, but they retain the
copyright, and after it has appeared in PSYCOLOQUY authors may
republish their text in any way they wish -- electronic or print -- as
long as they clearly acknowledge PSYCOLOQUY as its original locus of
publication. However, except in very special cases, agreed upon in
advance, contributions that have already been published or are being
considered for publication elsewhere are not eligible to be considered
for publication in PSYCOLOQUY,

Please submit all material to psyc@pucc.bitnet or psyc@pucc.princeton.edu
Anonymous ftp archive is DIRECTORY pub/harnad/Psycoloquy HOST princeton.edu
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE: To be eligible for publication, a PSYCOLOQUY
target article should not only have sufficient conceptual rigor,
empirical grounding, and clarity of style, but should also offer a
clear rationale for soliciting Commentary. That rationale should be
provided in the author's covering letter, together with a list of
suggested commentators.

A target article can be (i) the report and discussion of empirical
research; (ii) an theoretical article that formally models or
systematizes a body of research; or (iii) a novel interpretation,
synthesis, or critique of existing experimental or theoretical work.
Rrticles dealing with social or philosophical aspects of
the behavioral and brain sciences are also eligible..

The service of Open Peer Commentary will be primarily devoted
to original unpublished manuscripts. However, a recently published
book whose contents meet the standards outlined above may also be
eligible for Commentary. In such a Multiple Book Review, a
comprehensive, 500-line precis by the author is published
in advance of the commentaries and the author's response. In rare
special cases, Commentary will also be extended to a position paper
or an already published article dealing with particularly
influential or controversial research. Submission of an article
implies that it has not been published or is not being considered
for publication elsewhere. Multiple book reviews and previously
published articles appear by invitation only. The Associateship
and professional readership of PSYCOLOQUY are encouraged to nominate
current topics and authors for Commentary.

In all the categories described, the decisive consideration
for eligibility will be the desirability of Commentary for the
submitted material. Controversially simpliciter is not a
sufficient criterion for soliciting Commentary: a paper may be
controversial simply because it is wrong or weak. Nor is the mere
presence of interdisciplinary aspects sufficient: general
cybernetic and "organismic" disquisitions are not appropriate for
PSYCOLOQUY. Some appropriate rationales for seeking Open Peer
Commentary would be that: (1) the material bears in a significant way
on some current controversial issues in behavioral and brain sciences;
(2) its findings substantively contradict some well-established aspects
of current research and theory; (3) it criticizes the findings,
practices, or principles of an accepted or influential line of work;
(4) it unifies a substantial amount of disparate research; (5) it has
important cross-disciplinary ramifications; (6) it introduces an
innovative methodology or formalism for consideration by proponents of
the established forms; (7) it meaningfully integrates a body of brain
and behavioral data; (8) it places a hitherto dissociated area of
research into an evolutionary or ecological perspective; etc. In order
to assure communication with potential commentators (and readers) from
other PSYCOLOQUY specialty areas, all technical terminology must be clearly
defined or simplified, and specialized concepts must be fully
described.

NOTE TO COMMENTATORS: The purpose of the Open Peer Commentary
service is to provide a concentrated constructive interaction
between author and commentators on a topic judged to be of broad
significance to the biobehavioral science community. Commentators
should provide substantive criticism, interpretation, and
elaboration as well as any pertinent complementary or supplementary
material, such as illustrations; all original data will be refereed
in order to assure the archival validity of PSYCOLOQUY commentaries.
Commentaries and articles should be free of hyperbole and remarks
ad hominem.

STYLE AND FORMAT FOR ARTICLES AND COMMENTARIES TARGET ARTICLES:
should not exceed 500 lines (~4500 words); commentaries should not
exceed 200 lines (1800 words), including references. Spelling,
capitalization, and punctuation should be consistent within each
article and commentary and should follow the style recommended in the
latest edition of A Manual of Style, The University of Chicago Press.
It may be helpful to examine a recent issue of PSYCOLOQUY.

All submissions must include an indexable title, followed by the
authors' names in the form preferred for publication, full
institutional addresses and electronic mail addresses,
a 100-word abstract, and 6-12 keywords. Tables and diagrams should be
made screen-readable wherever possible (if unavoidable, printable
postscript files may contain the graphics separately).

All paragraphs should be numbered, consecutively. No line should
exceed 72 characters, and a blank line should separate paragraphs.

REFERENCES: Bibliographic citations in the text must include the
author's last name and the date of publication and may include page
references. Complete bibliographic information for each citation
should be included in the list of references. Examples of correct
style are: Brown(1973); (Brown 1973); Brown 1973; 1978); (Brown
1973; Jones 1976); (Brown & Jones 1978); (Brown et al. 1978).
References should be typed on a separate sheet in alphabetical
order in the style of the following examples. Do not abbreviate
journal titles.

 Kupfermann, I. & Weiss, K. (1978) The command neuron
 concept. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1:3-39.

 Dunn, J. (1976) How far do early differences in mother-child
 relations affect later developments? In: Growing point in
 ethology, ed. P. P. G. Bateson & R. A. Hinde, Cambridge University
 Press.

 Bateson, P. P. G. & Hinde, R. A., eds. (1978) Growing points in
 ethology, Cambridge University Press.

EDITING: PSYCOLOQUY reserves the right to edit and proof all articles
and commentaries accepted for publication. Authors of articles will be
given the opportunity to review the copy-edited draft. Commentators
will be asked to review copy-editing only when changes have been
substantial.

Dear John Bickle,  Sorry I didn't get this message in time to meet the July 5
deadline. I was on vacation.  I would have opted for not changing the meeting
time, once we start down that road, it may get messy.  Would be grateful
to know the results of the poll and the final decision on the meeting dates.

Subject: Please stop our chain letter
Status: R

Dear Madames, Sirs,

<PLEASE have the subject as below when you have read this and
is sending back the list:
'subject: The lists is terminated'
Thank you very much.>

<I am sorry if you had sent me a letter after you have had an
access to our WWW site. This was not supposed to be sent to you.>

  First of all, I have to deeply apologize everyone for my having
started a chain letter. Thank you very much for those of you who
have pointed out the troublesomeness about the chain letter.
I have decided to stop collecting signatures by using chain letter,
but then, I have to use the same method to stop it. So, 
please forgive me of my asking you to send this letter to everyone 
who you have sent the "Stop Nuclear Tests!" chain letter.
I am sending this letter to everyone who have sent me a letter
concering this matter, so some of you might receive more than one
copies of this letter, but again, forgive me of this happening.


  Now, this is what I would like you to do.

  If you have sent a copy of the "Stop Nuclear Tests!" chain letter
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
to your friends, please send a copy of this letter to each of those
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
friends as soon as possible.   
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you haven't sent a copy of it to anyone and still have the
copy in your hand, please send the list back to me. My e-mail address is

keshi@uticeaix1.icepp.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp

Don't forget to add your name on the list if you do think
the French government, or any other group should not execute
nuclear tests. 
  
  Right now, Shimizu Seishi and I are constructing a WWW Homepage 
to continue this activity. From now on, We will gather signatures 
via WWW, or simply accept signatures sent to us. We would also like to 
show the list on WWW, but if you don't want your name to be
open to the public, please tell me so. We will keep your name
on the list that will be sent to Mr. Chirac, the president of 
France, anyway.

  The WWW homepage will have the follwing contents:
* The objective of this activity
* The list of signatures
* A page to introduce opinions about the Nuclear Tests
* A page to ask for technical advices to make this activity a better one.
* Links to related pages

Thanks to all who participated in the poll concerning meeting times for
the 1996 Society for Philosophy and Psychology's annual meeting in San
Francisco.  A slight preference for changing the meetings to the earlier
date resulted, with the dominant reason being to avoid potential
conflict with the Slovenia conference.  Next year's meetings will be at
San Francisco State University May 30-June 2 (Thursday-Sunday).  The
Call for Papers will be sent to members and departments during the first
week in August.

My name is Kenneth Heard, a graduate student in Psychology at Connecticut 
College, New London, and a new list subscriber.  I am developing a 
reading list for an independent study for the Fall semester, and was 
hoping for suggestions.  

The question that I am going to evaluate is whether or not the scientific 
model of psychology is unethical.  The basis of this question is that by 
treating humans as objects, experimental psychology renders human 
experience invalid.  Once humans are objects, they are then legitimate 
targets of manipulation and control.  Psychology then becomes a tool of 
discipline in the service of the established social order.

I think it is reasonable to assert that science has had its abuses.  The
more basic question is are these abuses a necessary consequence of the
idea of self and moral universe that science reifies. 

By looking at this issue, I hope to gain a basic understanding of
hermeneutic methods, and familiarity with authors in hermeneutics,
literary criticism, and others who raise criticisms of the fundamental
assumptions of Psychology. 

I would appreciate any imput that list members may have to offer.

Ken

   Under a heading something like "Silly thing I just received," I recently
circulated to the behavior analysis list a query entitled "Is a science of
human behavior ethical?" and asked if anyone would like to answer it.  It was
a rash response to the question and I will admit to reacting to it as
outrageous, so I thought I ought to explain myself.

   A science of human behavior is not a thing; it is an activity.  To engage
in the science of human behavior is to do research to find out what makes
humans do what they do.  How could it possibly be unethical to find such
things out?  Does the author of the query really mean that it would be
unethical to try to understand the circumstances that affect what we do?  Does
he really believe that what we don't know about ourselves can't hurt us?

   Consider just a couple of examples.  We know that people who take
psychoactive drugs under unfamiliar circumstances are much more likely to die
of an overdose than those who take the drugs in familiar surroundings.  We
also know that children in an intensive care unit who must undergo painful
treatments for burns will be less like to become withdrawn if they are given
safety signals during periods when they will not be disturbed than if they do
not get such signals.  I chose these examples because they involve cases about
which we know a lot.  But they are two among a very large number of possible
examples; they are not just isolated instances.  We know a lot about why these
things happen based upon an ever-more-coherent and growing body of data on
human behavior.  In what conceivable way is it unethical to know these things
(or even, before we knew them, to have collected data to figure them out)? 
Does the author of the question really mean that where we don't know the
answers yet we shouldn't look?

   One of the arguments I make to students in my courses is that we are all
surrounded by innumerable institutions that work at changing our behavior:
politicians, advertisers, educators, religious leaders, legal and law
enforcement agencies, not to mention neighbors, friends and relatives.  Maybe
those institutions can't formulate why the things they do that are successful
work, but that doesn't mean that we are unaffected by them.  To the extent
that those things are effective, they are based on how human behavior works. 
We had better find out how human behavior works, because finding out is our
only hope and our only protectiion.  No one is in more of a position to be
victimized than the one who doesn't know how the victimization works.

   Is there nothing to be understood about how politicians and advertisers
and religious organizations and legal and law enforcement agencies and other
social and cultural institutions do it?  Does anyone truly believe that we can
negate their influences simply by asserting that we have free will, without
trying to understand how it is that they exert the influences they do?  Only
someone who is ignorant about what we know about how such influences work
could argue that we are better off not knowing about them.  The feeling of
freedom that may come from such ignorance is a myth.  In fact, the best
defense against such influences is not to maintain ignorance about them, but
to learn as much as about them as one possibly can.  The more you know about
how those influences work, the better you can defend against them.  That is
what the science of human behavior is all about.  Unfortunately, cultural
practices such as those illustrated by the query about which I became
exercised tend to discourage familarity with that science and therefore make
those unacknowledged influences more powerful.  But the phenomena will be just
as real whether you turn your back to them or not.

   Most of us would not argue that it was unethical to study plagues, viruses
and other disease processes, and to use the knowledge gained from such study
to prevent their spread.  In the face of so many problems that are clearly
problems of behavior (crime, violence, addiction, illiteracy, and so on), how
could it possibly be unethical to try to learn about ourselves, when we can
hardly hope to solve our problems without doing so?  We've only just begun,
but we already know a lot more than most people recognize.  Galileo's critics
wouldn't even look through his telescope.  Nowadays we ought to know better.

In my original "silly little thing," I made no assertion that science is 
a thing;  it is an activity, and one that exists within a moral and 
social context, which is best addressed in relation to a point you make below:

Science is an ideology and an institutionalized process that exerts social
control over individuals just as any of the institutions mentioned above. 
That it produces information isn't what I question.  My concerns are
two-fold:  

first:the ideology of science is inseparable from both its
methods and those products it will validate as objectivly "true."

second: it claims objectivity, and delegitimates all other 
forms of discourse.

third: it reifies a model of relating based on what Buber called an I-It 
relationship.  I propose that this has fundamentally destructive 
consequences to society

The assumptions that are foundational to Psychology, and the concepts of 
personhood and relatedness it asserts are valid subjects for critical 
examination.  In your own words,

"the phenomena will be just as real whether you turn your back to them or
not."

Subject: RE:the science of human behavior

Dear Kenneth Heard: The topics touched on in your initial query are
several, each with a history and fair-sized literature, some of it
very challenging.  For the most part, this literature is within the
philosophy of psychology, philosophy of science, history of science,
the philosophy and history of the social and behavioral sciences, and
the philosophy of mind.  Your questions are, of course, not standard
research questions within psychology; rather, they are meta-theoretical
or foundational.  To ask them is to risk dismissal by practicing
research psychologists!

Here are some suggestions to get your reading list started.
References given in these can supplement your list.

I sent a private posting of some reading suggestions, but as this topic
seems to have generated some public postings, I'll throw in some ideas.

There are, of course, ethical issues about the pursuit of any practice,
scientific or otherwise, and about how it is pursued.  And some basic
issues about the human sciences are easily raised when you juxtapose the
view that the goals of science are prediction and control (by no means
a universal view, of course) with ethical notions like respect for
personal autonomy, human rights, etc.  And likewise, as the original poster
suggested, when you consider issues about what happens when you begin
to think of human beings as objects rather than persons.

Two interesting discussions of these subjects with special reference to
the computer metaphor for the mind are found in:

Joseph Weizenbaum, COMPUTER POWER AND HUMAN REASON, and

Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores, UNDERSTANDING COMPUTATION AND COGNITION.

The former is quite accessible.  THe latter is explicitly Heideggerian
in inspiration, and may be rough going for folks who find things in that
style rough going.

A more general treatment of concerns about the application of certain kinds
of scientific attitudes to human beings that is more an essay for a general
educated audience is C.S. Lewis' THE ABOLITION OF MAN, which also deals
with other issues like relativism.

More tangential would be discussions of different approaches to our
understanding
of the mind--e.g., opposing a view of science centered on prediction and
control with a view of psychology in particular whose explicit aim is
health or the good of the soul (moral psychology).  Varela, Thompson and
Rosch's THE EMBODIED MIND seems to take this view ,for example.

I would be interested in knowing more exactly what this means. What is it
to "render" something in this sense? When is something "invalid"?

Clearly thou hast an agenda, and do not come to this discussion with an
open mind. Maybe a summary would help us understand thou, perhaps with some

        THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND HUMAN CHOICE

    ABSTRACT: We introduce a model of a subject facing a choice of an
    alternative out of a set. The model ties together three aspects of
    human activity: behavioral, mental, and neural-computational.
    Parameters of this model cannot be estimated experimentally. Thus,
    a problem arises of determining them by means of theoretical
    considerations. Similar problems appeared in cosmology as well:
    the values of the fundamental constants necessary for constructing
    models of the Universe cannot be determined empirically. One
    possible solution is to use the "anthropic principle," that is, an
    abstract statement which allows narrowing the number of
    combinations of values. We show that a similar methodological
    gambit can be used in psychology. We formulate an abstract
    statement and find the parameters of the model with its help. Here
    we establish the relation of this model to other theories of choice
    and to experimental psychology. Then we demonstrate that our model
    is formally isomorphic to the process of gradual minimization of
    work lost by a heat engine system. The existence of such an
    isomorphism supports a hypothesis that mental phenomena are related
    to macro-characteristics of an ensemble of neuron states.
   
    KEYWORDS: choice; computation; decision theory; ethical cognition;
    mathematical psychology; model building; parameter estimation;
    probability; rationality.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. In 1937, Paul Dirac, one of the founders of quantum mechanics,
noticed surprising coincidences between numbers characterizing the
micro-world and the Universe as a whole. Twenty years later, Robert X.
Dicke showed that this coincidence could be explained by assuming that
the conditions necessary for the appearance of an observer similar to a
human being correspond to a certain period in the evolution of the
Universe (Barrow & Tipler, 1986). Continuing this line of research
Brandon Carter suggested using a principle, which he called
"anthropic," for choosing constants in cosmological models. Its essence
is expressed in the statement:

     ...what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the
     conditions necessary for our presence as observers. 
     (Carter, 1974, p.291)

2. This declaration "forbade" constructing models of Universe in which
an observer similar to a human being could not appear. Since the
existence of human beings depends on the existence of organic
molecules, only those relations between fundamental constants that
allow organic molecules to appear in the Universe are acceptable.
Therefore, the anthropic principle can be regarded as a special method
of reasoning, on which to base our selection of cosmological models
(Barrow & Tipler, 1986).

3. According to this methodological scheme we formulate a statement
which cannot be empirically falsified but which allows us to generate
hypotheses concerning possible values of parameters in mathematical
models. In this way we can progress from models of isolated phenomena
to more general theoretical constructions.

4. We consider a concrete model of human activity related to choice.
This model ties together three aspects of this activity:  behavioral,
mental and neural-computational. We could not construct such a model,
however, if we followed a contemporary paradigm which requires that its
parameters must be estimated experimentally. Let us consider this
problem in more detail. We seek a function of variables x1, x2, and x3
by assuming that this function, X1=f(x1,x2,x3), is linear in each of
its arguments in the sense that if the values of any two are fixed, X1
is linear in the third.  It follows from this assumption that X1 can be
represented as a polynomial

f(x1,x2,x3)=a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x1x2+a5x1x3+a6x2x3+a7x1x2x3.  (1.1)

5. The right side of (1.1) contains eight parameters a0, a2,..., a7
whose values are unknown. Suppose that we have established
experimentally that /a0/<0.001 with probability 0.99. For predicting
behavior this information might be sufficient. But the properties of
f(x1,x2,x3), which must be known for establishing connections between
the different aspects of the model, may depend on the answer to a
cardinal question: whether a0 is equal to 0 or not? Experimental data,
in principle, cannot answer this question.  Similar problems appear
concerning other parameters as well.

6. We will demonstrate later how the idea similar to the anthropic
principle in cosmology allowed us to find the exact values for the
parameters a0, a1,...,a7 in a particular psychological model and how
knowledge of an analytical form of a function allowed us to suggest a
concrete hypothesis about the nature of computational processes in the
human brain.

7. Our point of departure is the following statement, which we will
call the Principle of Freedom:

     We have free will and under certain circumstances also 
     freedom of choice.

8. We will try to show that on this base a theory can be constructed
from which falsifiable models of psychological phenomena related to
choice can be deduced.

9. To give the terms "free will," "freedom of choice," and "certain
circumstances" an operational meaning, imagine an abstract subject who
is to choose one of six alternatives marked 1, 2, ..., 6 in the
following way. He must pick from a continuum of dies with different
centers of gravity, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the set of dies and the set of all possible probability
distributions of choosing an alternative from the six.  If there are no
obstacles, the subject (i) plans to use a certain die; (ii) picks it
from the continuum, and (iii) casts it, thereby choosing one of the six
alternatives. Note that the subject can make a completely determined
choice, namely, he can plan to use only those dies which always show
the same face up.

10. Imagine now that a state of the external world that may or may not
interfere with the process of actually taking from the continuum the
die the subject planned to use. For each plan there are such states of
the world.

11. The statement asserting the subject's freedom of will means that he
can plan to use any of the dies from the continuum independently from
the state of the world.

12. The statement that under certain circumstances the subject has
freedom of choice means that there are states of the world that do not
interfere with the process of using the die the subject planned to use.
In this way we distinguish between "free will" and "freedom of choice."

13. Complete absence of freedom of choice means that some state of the
world exactly predetermines the die to be taken. In this case the
subject's choice does not depend on his intention.

14. We will call a choice realistic if the subject plans to use only
those dice that can be taken under a given state of the world.  A
subject who makes only realistic choices will be called a Realist.

15. This scheme reflects two different tendencies in psychology.
Miller, Galanter and Pribram (1960) emphasized the plan as a central
element of human activity. The distinction between a readiness (or
setting) to act, on the one hand, and the actual act, on the other,
evolved from gestalt-psychology and was developed by Uznadze (1968) and
his school (Prangishvili, 1967). In our scheme, the subject with a die
in his hands represents the state of readiness to act, and casting a
die the act itself.

II. A GENERAL MODEL

16. A subject facing a choice from a set of n alternatives (n>=2) will
be represented by the function

a=G(b,c), a and c are elements of D, b is an element of S.   (2.1)

17. The set D={(p1,p2,...,pn)}, where pi>=0, i=1,2,...,n, and
p1+p2+...+pn=1, is the set of all probability distributions on a given
set of n alternatives, and S is the set of all possible states of the
world. Variable a represents the probability distribution
characterizing the state of the subject's readiness to choose an
alternative. Variable b represents the world influence on a particular
choice. Variable c represents the probability distribution which the
subject plans to use for choosing an alternative.

18. The statement that the subject has a freedom of will corresponds to
the assumption that variables b and c are independent.

19. The statement that under certain circumstances the subject has
freedom of choice corresponds to the assumption that there exist an S1
subset of S such that for every b element of S1, the following identity
holds

G(b,x)==x,                                                  (2.2)

where x is any distribution from D and "==" means identical.

20. The existence of states of the world that predetermine the
subject's choice behavior implies that there exists an S2 subset of S
such that for every b element of S2 there is exactly one y(b) element
of D that satisfies the identity

G(b,x)==y(b),                                               (2.3)

where x is any distribution in D.

21. The Realist is represented by the Equation

G(b,x)=x,                                                   (2.4)

where x is element of D and b is element of S.

22. Let us put each element b which is element of S into correspondence
with the set D[b] using the following rule: if with a given b Equation
(2.4) does not have a solution, then D[b] is an empty set; otherwise,
D[b] consists of all the elements x which are elements of D for which
Equation (2.4) holds. Therefore we introduce a single-valued function
g(b):

D[b]= g(b).                                                 (2.5)

23. Not all sets D[b] are empty, because when b is element of S1,
D[b]=D (follows from (2.2)), and when b is element of S2, D[b] is a
one-element set {y(b)} (follows from (2.3)).

24. Let us emphasize that on the right-hand side of (2.5), there is
only one variable b corresponding to the state of the world. By
comparing (2.5) with (2.1) we see that in the case when a choice is
realistic, that is, when a=c, we can exclude variable c from
consideration; its values are subjective phenomena and as such,
non-observable. Imagine that we want to predict a Realist decision if
we know the function g(b) and having observed the value of variable b.
If D[b] is empty set, this means that with a given b realistic choice
is impossible, and that the Realist refuses to choose. If D[b] contains
only one element, this means that the subject will use one particular
distribution, hence Equation (2.5) allows us to make a precise
prognosis. If D[b]=D, this means that the subject has freedom of choice
and can decide to use any of the distributions in D. Therefore, the
state in which the subject has the ability to make a free choice cannot
in principle correspond to any kind of concrete probability
distribution. In this case observation of the world does not allow us
to make a more precise prognosis. If D[b] consists of more than one
element and D-D[b] is not an empty set, we can predict that the Realist
will not use distributions belonging to D-D[b]. We cannot say, however,
which distribution from D[b] he will use; in this case we say that the
subject has partial freedom of choice.

III. A MODEL OF BINARY CHOICE

25. We use the ideas described above to construct a concrete model of a
subject making binary choices (Lefebvre, 1992a) and a model of choice
among any number of alternatives (Lefebvre, 1994a). In the binary
choice model, we consider a subject choosing between a positive and a
negative pole. The subject is represented by the function

X1=f(x1,x2,x3),                                             (3.1)

where X1,x1,x2,x3 are elements of [0,1]. The value of X1 is interpreted
as the readiness to choose a positive pole with probability X1, and the
value of x3 as the subject's plan or intention to choose a positive
pole with probability x3. Variables x1 and x2 represent the world
influence on the subject. Thus, variable b in Equation (2.1) above
corresponds to the pair (x1,x2) in Equation (3.1).

26. We assume that in every choice situation the world influences the
subject by two kinds of impulses. An impulse of the first kind
stimulates the subject to choose a positive pole, one of the second
kind a negative pole. The value of x1 is the frequency of the impulses
toward a positive pole (at the time of the subject makes his choice).
The value of x2 is the mean frequency of the impulses toward a positive
pole, sent to the subject in similar previous situations (including the
present one). Thus, the value of x2 reflects the subject's earlier
experience, in other words, the subject's "knowledge" about a class of
similar experiences.

27. Next we introduce 

POSTULATE OF SIMPLICITY: 

Function (3.1) is linear in each of its three arguments.

As mentioned in the Introduction, it follows from this assumption that
f(x1,x2,x3) can be represented as in a (1.1), i.e. containing eight
unknown parameters. We can find these parameters by formulating certain
limitations for function (3.1). Those limitations will correspond to
the requirements posed to the subject who possesses free will and the
ability for free choice.  They are given by Equations (2.2) and (2.3).
First we formulate these limitations as axioms; then we will discuss
their meaning.

28. Equation (2.2) corresponds to

I. THE AXIOM OF FREE CHOICE

For any x3 element of [0,1], f(0,0,x3)==x3.                 (3.2)

The set S1, in this case, contains at least one element b=(0,0).

29. Expression (2.3) corresponds to the following two axioms:

II. THE AXIOM OF CREDULITY

For any x3 element of [0,1], f(0,1,x3)==0.                   (3.3)

III. THE AXIOM OF NON-EVIL-INCLINATIONS

For any x2,x3 elements of [0,1], f(1,x2,x3)==1.              (3.4)

The set S2 in this case consists of at least an element (0,1)
and a set of elements (1,x2), where x2 takes on values from [0,1].

30. The restrictions corresponding to Equations (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4)
stem from moral philosophy, which has a rich history of logical
manipulation involving the categories of good and evil. In that field
freedom of choice is usually linked with responsibility: a person is
responsible for his actions if at the moment of its performance he was
free to perform it and conversely (Losskii, 1927). Thus expression
(3.2) corresponds to the statement: If the state of the world inclines
the subject to perform a negative action (x1=0), and the subject knows
this (x2=0), then the subject is responsible for the choice. Expression
(3.3) states: If the state of the world inclines the subject to perform
a negative action (x1=0), but the subject believes that the world
always presses toward good (x2=1), then the subject yields to the
world's pressure (X1=0). Finally, expression (3.4) corresponds to the
statement: A human being is not a source of evil; temptation can come
only from an external agent. Hence if the world urges the subject to
perform a positive action (x1=1), only the positive action can be
performed (X1=1). Such recourse to moral philosophy may create the
impression that I suppose a human being to be an innately moral being.
Karl Popper wrote in his note about my book (Lefebvre, 1992a):

    No psychologist will like this. Everyone will say this means
    thinking of man as an essentially moral being. (Popper, 1992)

31. Here is my answer: The problem of morality in a religious or any
other conventional sense is not important for constructing a model.
Relying on moral philosophy is a technique which helps to find the
values of initial conditions.

32. Using the Postulate of Simplicity, Axioms I, II, and III we can
write a system of equations for parameters a0, a1, ..., a7:

f(0,0,x3)==x3,
f(0,1,x3)==0,                                                (3.5)
f(1,x2,x3)==1.

33. After solving this system we find that a0=0, a1=1, a2=0, a3=1,
a4=0, a5=-1, a6=-1, a7=1. Substituting these values into (1.1) we
obtain:

X1=x1+(1-x1-x2+x1x2)x3.                                     (3.6)

34. Heretofore, we have found a specific function from the class of
functions given by Equation (1.1) without experimental estimation of
the parameters a0, a2, ..., a7 but using an abstract principle of
freedom, instead (Lefebvre, 1992a).

35. To represent the Realist, (X1=x3), expression (3.6) can be written
as

       x1/(x1+x2-x1x2), if x1+x2>0
X1 = {                                                      (3.7)
       any number from [0,1], if x1+x2=0.

36. Equation (3.7) corresponds to expression (2.5), where b is an
element of the set of all pairs (x1,x2). If x1+x2>0, then the set
D[(x1,x2)] consists of a single distribution (X1,1-X1) given by
Equation (3.7), and if x1+x2=0, then D[(0,0)] coincides with the set of
all the distributions.

37. Recently Schreider (1994) showed that in another interpretation,
Equation (3.6) can be deduced from pure probabilistic considerations.
We can also deduce this equation from an earlier version of our model
(Lefebvre, 1977a; 1980; 1982). Based on this version a special method
of simulating human decision making has been developed (Shankin, 1994).
Experimental aspects related to the early version of the model were
discussed by Adams-Webber (1987) and Zajonc (1987), and its logical
and epistemological aspects were analyzed by Rapoport (1982; 1990),
Townsend (1983; 1990), Levitin (1987), McClain (1987), Wheeler (1987;
1990), Batchelder (1987), and Kauffman (1990).

38. Further we will show that the functions (3.6) and (3.7) can be
directly related to observable psychological phenomena (Lefebvre, 1990,
1992a, 1994a).

IV. RELATION TO BRADLEY-TERRY-LUCE (BTL) MODEL

39. The BTL model is a distinctive starting point in the psychology of
choice. It helps to compare various probabilistic models of choice
behavior. In the case of binary choice, the BTL model is based on the
assumption that the probabilities of choosing alternatives belonging to
a certain set are proportional to their utilities. Thus, if utilities
of alternatives A and B are respectively v1 and v2, then the
probability that A will be chosen from the set {A,B} is given by

p(A,B)=v1/(v1+v2).                                          (4.1)

40. Imagine now that the Realist, represented by function (3.7), is
making a choice between A and B. Without loss of generality, we can
assume v1>=v2. Let A be the positive pole, and B the negative pole.

41. We assume that the world's pressure toward the positive pole is
given by

x1=(v1-v2)/v1.                                              (4.2)

We will explain the reasons for choosing this expression at the end of
section 8.

42. If the subject has had no prior experience in similar situations,
then in accordance with definition of x2, x1=x2.  Substituting the
values of x1 and x2, given in (4.2), into (3.7) we find the relation
between the probability X1 that the subject is ready to choose
alternative A and utilities v1 and v2:

      v1/(v1+v2), if v1>v2
X1 = {                                                      (4.3)
      any number from [0,1], if v1=v2.

43. We see that on the basis of assumption (4.2) our model coincides
with the BTL model for the case of v1>v2. We can even say that the BTL
model is deduced from ours. However, for the case v1=v2 the model
predictions are different. According to the BTL model each alternative
will be chosen with probability 1/2, whereas our model implies that in
this case the subject has freedom of choice: he can select any
probability of choosing alternative A (Lefebvre, 1994a).

V. CATEGORIZATION OF STIMULI WITH MEASURABLE INTENSITY

44. Almost forty years ago Stevens and Galanter (1957) found that the
results of magnitude estimation of stimuli intensities are related
non-linearly to their categorical estimation. In the first case,
subjects estimate intensities comparing them with a unit of
measurement. In the second case, subjects attribute the intensity of
each stimulus to a certain level. Such levels can be represented by a
set of numbers, where 1 corresponds to the weakest stimulus, and k to
the strongest. If we plot magnitude estimations against categorical
estimations, the graph will be an upward convex curve rather than a
straight line. Further, the convexity is greater when the mean values
of stimuli are shifted toward the weakest stimulus.  The interrelation
between these two methods of estimation was debated for a long time
(Stevens & Galanter, 1957; Galanter & Messick, 1961; Parducci, 1965;
Marks, 1968; Haubensak, 1992; Parducci, 1992). However, no persuasive
theoretical explanation has been offered.

45. Lefebvre (1992a) attempted to explain this non-linear relation with
the help of the model described in this paper. A subject is represented
by equation

X1=x1/(x1+x2-x1x2),                                          (5.1)

where x1+x2>0 (cf. (3.7)). Suppose the subject is able "to answer a
question" about his readiness to choose a positive pole. Let him do
this by marking a point X1 on the interval [0,1]. In this way we extend
our model by assuming that the final result of the subject's activity,
in addition to the actual choice, can also be the subject's "report"
about the value X1. We interpret such a report as a categorization.

46. Consider first a case of bipolar categorization. Let magnitude
estimations of stimuli found in earlier experiments be between Smax and
Smin. The subject's task in the given experiment is to categorize each
stimulus as "strong" or "weak." Suppose the attractiveness of
alternative "strong" is v1=Smax-Smin, while that of "weak" is
v2=Smax-S, where S is the intensity of the presented stimulus: the more
intensive is the stimulus, the less attractive is the alternative
"weak." Interpreting the alternative "strong" as the positive pole and
using Equation (4.2) we obtain

x1=(S-Smin)/(Smax-Smin).                                    (5.2)

47. We will call this value a normalized magnitude estimation. In
accordance with the definition in section III, x2 takes on the mean
value of normalized magnitude estimations of stimuli preceding a given
one (including itself). The value of X1 is the subject's readiness to
choose "strong" with probability X1.

48. When a scale with a large number of categories is used, the subject
marks the value of X1 on the scale. For well-randomized long sequences
of stimuli presentation, we can assume x2 to be constant in a given
experiment. In this case expression (5.1) can be regarded as an
equation of a hyperbola with variables X1 and x1 and a constant
parameter x2. Larger convexity of the hyperbola corresponds to smaller
x2. Such hyperbolas appear to fit published experimental results on
categorization (sf. Lefebvre, 1992a). It is also noteworthy that values
of variables x1 and x2 can be estimated from experimental data. Thus,
the model contains no free parameters.

VI. THE GOLDEN SECTION AND CATEGORIZATION OF STIMULI WITHOUT 
    MEASURABLE INTENSITY

49. For many centuries the golden section [g=(SQRT5-1)/2=0.618...] was
regarded as especially attractive (cf., for example, Ghyka, 1946).
Attempts to refute or confirm this hypothesis began with Fechner
(1876); but the question of whether this phenomenon really exists
remained unanswered (cf. reviews in Valentine, 1962; Plug, 1980;
Lefebvre, 1992b). A new wave of interest in the golden section was
generated by the works of Adams-Webber and Benjafield, who found that
subjects evaluate their acquaintances positively in bipolar constructs
with a frequency close to 0.62. They hypothesized that the theoretical
value of this frequency is identical with the golden section
(Adams-Webber & Benjafield, 1973; Benjafield & Adams-Webber, 1976;
Adams-Webber, 1990).

50. Analyzing other subsequent experiments we found that the
frequencies of choice of the positive pole lie in the interval
0.60-0.64 (see review in Lefebvre, 1992b) and suggested that the golden
section is not limited to evaluations of other people but appears in
binary choice or categorical estimation of stimuli without measurable
qualities (Lefebvre, 1985; 1990). We also proposed a model similar to
the one described here from which an explanation of the phenomenon is
deduced (Lefebvre, 1985).

51. Suppose a subject represented by Equation (3.6) faces a choice
between two alternatives without objective measure in the context of
the given situation. Let the subject relate the first alternative to a
positive pole, the second to a negative pole, and let the
attractiveness of these alternatives be v1=1 and v2=x3. The latter
means that the greater the probability with which the subject is
planning to choose the first alternative, the more attractive becomes
for him the second alternative. Let also the attractiveness of the
positive alternative be always greater than that of negative one, that
is, v2=x3<1. In view of (4.2), we have x1=(v1-v2)/v1=1-x3. Next suppose
the subject had never faced a similar choice in the past. In view of
the definition of x2 (see section 3) we must set x1=x2. By substituting
the values x1=x2=1-x3 into Equation (3.6), we obtain

X1=1-x3+x3^3, where x3^3 means "x3 to the power of 3."       (6.1)

52. Suppose that the subject is a Realist, that is, X1=x3. Then
Equation (6.1) is transformed into a cubic equation

x3^3-2x3+1=0.                                               (6.2)

53. Positive roots of this equation are x3=1 and x3=(SQRT5-1)/2.  The
first one does not satisfy the condition x3<1. Therefore, the subject
chooses a positive pole with the probability equal to the golden
section value.

54. Consider an experiment conducted by Kunst-Wilson and Zajonc (1980),
in which the ideas presented here played no part. The stimuli were 20
irregular octagons. During the first stage of the experiment, ten of
these octagons were presented one by one with a very short expositions,
1 millisecond, five times each. During the second stage, octagons were
presented in pairs: one which was presented earlier and one new one.
The subjects were not told that one of the octagons was among those
seen earlier; their task was to indicate which octagon they liked more.
The octagon seen earlier was preferred with frequency 0.60. Table 1
shows the frequencies of preference for objects seen earlier in a
number of similar experiments:

                             Table 1

    Experimenter                  Frequency
    
    Kunst-Wilson et al.(1980)     0.60
    Seamon et al.(1983)           0.61
    Mandler et al.(1987)          0.62
    Bonanno et al.(1986)          0.66, 0.63, 0.62, 0.61, 0.63, 0.62

55. As can be seen, the frequencies cluster around 0.62. We found no
indications in the literature that this fact was noticed.

56. Our model suggests an explanation of this phenomenon. The first
stage of the experiments determined the polarization of the objects:
the object seen earlier became the positive pole; the new one the
negative. The stimuli had no measurable properties which might
determine the preference between the objects. Consequently the pressure
of the world was determined by the subject's intention, which led to a
preference for the positive pole with probability close to the golden
section ratio.

VII. A MODEL OF AUTOMATIC AWARENESS

57. In 1908 a psychiatrist from Prague, H. Loewy, discovered a new
psychological phenomenon (see Reznik, 1969). One of his patients
complained that she had lost all her inner feelings. Her statements,
however, contrasted with the objective observations made by Loewy: her
tone, look, and style of behavior suggested that she had deep feelings
making her suffer. Loewy was confronted with a paradox: the patient
suffers because she is convinced that she does not.

58. According to Mayer-Gross,

     The paradoxical occurrence of such complaints in patients who
     obviously suffer from the alleged death of their feelings has
     aroused great interest in all writers on the subject. 
     (Mayer-Gross, 1935, p.108)

59. Here are typical patients' reports:

     "My emotions are gone, nothing affects me." "All the feeling is
     gone, no remorse, no passion. I have only the feeling of being
     alive, that my heart beats..." "My feeling is dead, I have no
     interest for my husband and the baby." "Nothing impresses me, ...
     I have lost all my love for the children, they seem miles away."
     "I am unable to have any emotions, everything is detached from
     me." "The trees in the garden seem unreal, I get no feeling, no
     thrill, no joy ... ." "I cannot see the beauty of flowers -- the
     feeling does not get past my eyes." (Mayer-Gross, 1935,
     pp. 107-108)

60. Sometimes the patients themselves find that the meaning of their
statements contradicts their form:

     "One of my patients remarked on her own surprise at this
      paradox, viz. that she should weep in the very act of complaining
      about loss of feeling." (Mayer-Gross, 1935, p.108)

61. One of the attempts to construct an explanatory scheme for
this phenomenon was made by Reznik (1969). He assumed that a person
in a normal state has the ability to sense his own feelings; that
is, in addition to the feelings as such, there is also a secondary
ability to "feel" the process of feeling, although this ability is
not consciously registered. In the case Loewy observed, the patient
had lost this secondary ability, so that she did not sense her own
feelings and believed that they were missing.

62. Although this phenomenon has been known to psychiatrists for a long
time, it did not attract attention of psychologists studying the
cognitive realm of human beings. Perhaps the inner mechanism of
"awareness" of one's own feelings is akin to the mechanism of awareness
of one's own visual perception (Gazzaniga, 1970; Griffin, 1976). In
that case, the loss of the ability to see one's own feeling is close to
the phenomenon of paradoxical vision or blindsight, the essence of
which is that subjects with damage to the visual cortex can move around
and not collide with objects but at the same time be sure that they
don't see these objects (Zihl, 1980; 1981; Zihl & von Cramon, 1985;
Paillard et al., 1983; Perenin & Jeannerod, 1978).

63. Another phenomenon which might be close to those already described
is the "feeling of knowing": sometimes subjects report that they have a
feeling that they will be able to retrieve unrecalled information under
specific conditions (Hart, 1965; see also Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994).

64. On the other hand, although all those phenomena are usually
described in similar terms, such as awareness, metacognition, and
attention (Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994), we cannot rule out the
possibility that by their neural physiological nature they belong to
different functional systems in the human brain (Gazzaniga, 1995).

65. We will show further that the theoretical representation of the
subject described in the previous sections allows us to develop a model
of the subject capable of becoming aware of his own feelings (Lefebvre,
1980; 1992a,b).

66. We consider a human being possessing a specialized functional
processor generating an "image of the self," which, in turn, generates
a second "image of the self." The first "image of the self" is related
to the subject's direct feelings; the second order "image of the self"
allows the subject to "see" himself feeling.  The generation of the
first and second order of the "image of the self" goes on
automatically; it is not related to any voluntary constructive activity
(Lefebvre, 1967; 1977b). Under certain disruptive conditions, however,
a secondary image is not generated. This gives rise to the paradox
discovered by Loewy: a person has feelings but does not sense himself
having them. A connection between this scheme of the process of
automatic awareness and the model of the subject developed in the
previous sections is given by the following

67. STATEMENT: The function X1=x1+(1-x1-x2+x1x2)x3 of three variables
x1, x2, and x3 can be represented as composition

X1=F(x1,F(x2,x3)),                                          (7.1)

of one function, F(x,y), of two variables x and y, where 

F(x,y)=1-y+xy.                                              (7.2)

This representation is unique. (The proof is given in Lefebvre,
1992a).

68. We consider the function 

X2=F(x2,x3)                                                 (7.3)

as a formal analogue for the subject's image of the self. In this
interpretation, the subject's self-description and the objective
description by an external observer are presented by the same function
F(x,y). We thus obtain a model of a subject "aware" of the self. In the
case in which the subject is a Realist (X1=x3), Equations (7.1) and
(7.3) transform into Equations (7.4) and (7.5) respectively:

X1=F(x1,F(x2,X1)),                                          (7.4)

X2=F(x2,X1).                                                (7.5)

69. It follows from these Equations that, if x1+x2>0, then
X1=x1/(x1+x2-x1x2),
							    (7.6)
X2=x2/(x1+x2-x1x2),

and if x1+x2=0, then

X2=1-X1,                                                    (7.7)

where X1 is an arbitrary number from [0,1].

70. Variables X1 and X2 can be represented as identities

X1==F(x1,X2), X2==F(x2,X1).                                 (7.8)

71. In order to simplify the analysis, we represent X1 as a composition
of F1=F(x1,u) and u=X2, and X2 as a composition of F2=F(x2,v) and v=X1
by using a standard notation for function composition:

X1==F1oX2, X2==F2oX1.                                       (7.9)

72. It follows from (7.9) that X1 can be put into correspondence with
the sequence of its representations as compositions of F1, F2, and Xj:

X[1]==F1 o X2,
X[2]==F1 o F2 o X1,                                          (7.10)
. . . . . . . 
X[n]==F1 o F2 o F1 o ... o Fi o Xj,
                 _
where i,j=1,2; j=i.

73. A subject corresponding to composition X[1] has an image of the
self X2, but this image does not have an image of the self. A subject
corresponding to composition X[2] has an image of the self F2oX1, and
this image, in turn, has an image of the self X1. We identify an image
of the self, F2oX1, with the subject's inner feelings, and an image's
image of the self; X1, with the "sense" of one's own feelings (using
Reznik's term). Loewy's paradox appears when there is a disruption such
that a subject in the state X[1] cannot proceed to the state X[2]. The
subject has feelings connected with his image of the self, but his
image of the self does not have feelings, and the subject is incapable
of "seeing" the self with the feelings.

74. In the general case, we put an act of automatic awareness into
correspondence with the transformation X[k]->X[k+1] (Lefebvre, 1967;
1977b). Then composition X[n] will correspond to a state of the subject
appearing as a result of (n-1) acts of awareness starting with X[1].

75. When the subject is in the state X[n], every image of the self (in
the hierarchy of images) is presented together with the influence of
the world. Therefore, in addition to the hierarchy of self-images, the
subject has a hierarchy of world's images. These images are connected
with the subject's feelings of the world. So, the subject has feelings
of the two types and both are included into multiple awareness: some
are connected with self-reference, and the others with the reference to
the external world (Lefebvre, 1967; 1977b).

76. Every composition from (7.10) can be regarded as a formal operator
mapping a set of pairs of values (x1,x2) onto a set of pairs of vectors
(A,a), (See Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Connection between composition X[n] and vectors of feelings A
and a. The upper lane corresponds to vector A which is a theoretical
analogue of the feelings linked to self-reference. The lower lane
corresponds to vector a which is a theoretical analogue of the feelings
linked to the reference of the external world.
---------------------------------------------------------------

77. The upper lane corresponds to vector A=(X1,X2,X1,...) whose
periodical components are the values of functions F1, F2, and Xj
(j=1,2) occurring in composition. This vector is a theoretical analogue
of the subject's feelings (and their multiple reflexion) linked to
self-reference. The lower lane corresponds to vector a=(x1,x2,x1,...)
whose components also constitute a periodical sequence. This vector is
an analogue of the subject's feelings (and their multiple reflexion)
linked with reference to the external world (Lefebvre, 1992b).

78. In the next section we will try to move further and show that the
model that we have constructed allows us to make some assumptions about
computational brain work.

VIII. AWARENESS, THERMODYNAMICS, AND BRAIN NEURAL NETWORKS

79. One of the hypotheses concerning the general principles of the
functioning of real brain neural networks is that the ensemble of
neuron states is a similar statistical ensemble of physical particles
obeying the laws of statistical physics and thermodynamics (Cowan,
1967). The models of some types of such networks already exist
(Hopfield, 1982; Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Hinton & Sejnowski, 1983;
Ackley et al., 1985; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992).

80. In the framework of this "thermodynamic" representation, mental
phenomena can be connected with macro-characteristics of an ensemble of
neuron states, such as "heat," "temperature," and "entropy." If we
accept this hypothesis, we may expect that formal schemes of mental
processes reflect thermodynamic correlations between different
macro-characteristics of neuron ensembles. In the previous section we
constructed a formal model of one particular mental phenomenon, the
awareness of one's own feelings. No specific information taken from
statistical physics and thermodynamics was used to do this. Therefore,
if we show that our model can be easily and clearly translated into the
language of thermodynamics, this will serve as an argument in favor of
plausibility of both our model and the thermodynamic hypothesis as a
whole. Further we will make such a translation by demonstrating that
the process of multiple awareness described in the previous section is
isomorphic to the process of gradual minimization of work lost by a
heat engine system.

81. Let us consider an abstract heat machine consisting of a sequence
of heat engines and two tapes, on which the engines print their working
parameters (see Fig. 2).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 2. A heat machine. Reservoirs correspond to vertical lines.
Each engine prints its efficiency Rm=(Qm-Q{m+1})/Qm on the bottom tape,
and the values Mm=Rm/[(T1-T2)/T1] on the upper tape.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

82. In this sequence each succeeding engine performs work compensating
for the loss of available work by the preceding engine by receiving
from a reservoir the amount of heat equal to that yielded to this
reservoir by the preceding engine. The temperatures of reservoirs make
a decreasing geometrical progression: 

T1/T2=T2/T3= ...,                                           (8.1)

where T1>T2.  Engine m performs work

Wm=Qm-Q{m+1}, where {m+1} is a subscript.                   (8.2)

83. We do not require an engine to be necessarily reversible, so

Wm<=Um, where "<=" means "lesser than or equal to,"         (8.3)

and where

        Tm-T{m+1}      T1-T2
Um = Qm --------- = Qm -----                                (8.4)
           Tm           T1

is the work which would be performed by a reversible engine if it were
located between reservoirs m and (m+1). The loss of available work by
engine m is equal to

                    Q{m+1}   Qm
dWm = Um - Wm = T2(------- - --) = T2dH,                    (8.5)
                     T2      T1

where dH is the change of entropy of the whole system caused by engine
m performing work Wm. Engine (m+1) receives from a reservoir (m+1) heat
Q{m+1} and performs work dWm. Each engine measures the work it performs
and registers it in two ways: as a portion of the heat received from
the reservoir, Rm, and as a portion of the work which would be
performed by a reversible engine under the same conditions, Mm. The
engine prints on the lower tape the value

Rm=Wm/Qm=(Qm-Q{m+1})/Qm,                                    (8.6)

that is, the efficiency of engine m, and on the upper tape the value

          Wm              Rm
Mm = -------------- = ----------,                           (8.7)
     Qm[(T1-T2)/T1]   (T1-T2)/T1

that is, the ratio of the efficiency of engine m to the efficiency of
reversible engine.

84. We consider these printed quantities to be theoretical analogues
for subjective processes. We proved that the "text" printed by such a
heat machine is formally equivalent to the "text" generated by a
composition X[n] (Lefebvre, 1994b). The two following statements are
true concerning this sequence of heat engines.

85. STATEMENT 1. Sequences Rm and Mm are periodic and

      R1 if m is odd
Rm = {
      R2 if m is even ,
                                                            (8.8)
      M1 if m is odd
Mm = {
      M2 if m is even ,

where

R1=(Q1-Q2)/Q1, R2=[Q2-(T2/T1)Q1]/Q2,                        (8.9)

M1=R1/[(T1-T2)/T1], M2=R2/[(T1-T2)/T1].                     (8.10)

86. STATEMENT 2.

M1=R1/(R1+R2-R1R2),
                                                            (8.11)
M2=R2/(R1+R2-R1R2).

We can see that equations (8.11) are equivalent to equations (7.6).

87. Consider an arbitrary heat machine and establish the correspondence

R1=x1, R2=x2.                                               (8.12)

88. By using (8.9) we find that

Q1/Q2=1-x1, T2/T1=(1-x1)(1-x2).                             (8.13)

Figure 3. A heat machine which prints out vectors of feelings on
tapes.
---------------------------------------------------------------

89. Let us choose an arbitrary pair (x1,x2), where neither x1 nor x2 is
equal to 1 and x1+x2>0, and two arbitrary pairs (Q1, Q2) and (T1, T2)
which satisfy equations (8.13). Construct now a finite machine in which
those four values are used (Fig. 3). In accordance with (7.6), (8.11),
and (8.12), composition X[n] in Fig. 1 and heat machine in Fig. 3, with
given values of x1 and x2, generate the same pair of vectors of
feelings A and a. Let us choose now x1=0 and x2=0. In this case T1=T2,
which follows from (8.13). Therefore, the subject's state in which he
has the ability to make free choice corresponds to the state of heat
equilibrium in which engines cannot perform work.

90. By establishing one-to-one correspondence between a sequence of
functions constituting the composition on Fig. 1 and a sequence of heat
engines constituting the heat machine on Fig. 3, we settle the
isomorphism between the analytical and the thermodynamic models.

91. Let us return to Equation (4.2). Its meaning becomes clear from the
thermodynamic model. Let utility v1 correspond to the heat Q1 received
by engine 1 from reservoir 1 and utility v2 to the heat Q2 yielded by
engine 1 to the reservoir 2. We showed in this section that x1
corresponds to the efficiency R1 of engine 1 (see (8.9) and (8.12)).
Equation (4.2) reflects this parallel.

IX. CONCLUSION

92. We will conclude by adding to the formulation of the Anthropic
Principle in cosmology the formulation of the Principle of Freedom:

     What we can expect to observe must be restricted by conditions
     necessary for our presence as observers. We have free will and
     under some circumstances also freedom of choice.

93. The first sentence helps us construct concrete models of Universe;
the second concrete models of the human being. However, the combined
statement is more than a sum of its two parts. We can now say

     What we expect to observe must be restricted by conditions under
     which we at least sometimes have a free choice.

94. This means that we are not only observers but also to a certain
degree creators of the reality we observe. This is the content of the
connections between psychology and cosmology on the level of abstract
principles.

    ABSTRACT: We introduce a model of a subject facing a choice of an
    alternative out of a set. The model ties together three aspects of
    human activity: behavioral, mental, and neural-computational.
    Parameters of this model cannot be estimated experimentally. Thus,
    a problem arises of determining them by means of theoretical
    considerations. Similar problems appeared in cosmology as well:
    the values of the fundamental constants necessary for constructing
    models of the Universe cannot be determined empirically. One
    possible solution is to use the "anthropic principle," that is, an
    abstract statement which allows narrowing the number of
    combinations of values. We show that a similar methodological
    gambit can be used in psychology. We formulate an abstract
    statement and find the parameters of the model with its help. Here
    we establish the relation of this model to other theories of choice
    and to experimental psychology. Then we demonstrate that our model
    is formally isomorphic to the process of gradual minimization of
    work lost by a heat engine system. The existence of such an
    isomorphism supports a hypothesis that mental phenomena are related
    to macro-characteristics of an ensemble of neuron states.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. In 1937, Paul Dirac, one of the founders of quantum mechanics,
noticed surprising coincidences between numbers characterizing the
micro-world and the Universe as a whole. Twenty years later, Robert X.
Dicke showed that this coincidence could be explained by assuming that
the conditions necessary for the appearance of an observer similar to a
human being correspond to a certain period in the evolution of the
Universe (Barrow & Tipler, 1986). Continuing this line of research
Brandon Carter suggested using a principle, which he called
"anthropic," for choosing constants in cosmological models. Its essence
is expressed in the statement:

     ...what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the
     conditions necessary for our presence as observers. 
     (Carter, 1974, p.291)

2. This declaration "forbade" constructing models of Universe in which
an observer similar to a human being could not appear. Since the
existence of human beings depends on the existence of organic
molecules, only those relations between fundamental constants that
allow organic molecules to appear in the Universe are acceptable.
Therefore, the anthropic principle can be regarded as a special method
of reasoning, on which to base our selection of cosmological models
(Barrow & Tipler, 1986).

3. According to this methodological scheme we formulate a statement
which cannot be empirically falsified but which allows us to generate
hypotheses concerning possible values of parameters in mathematical
models. In this way we can progress from models of isolated phenomena
to more general theoretical constructions.

4. We consider a concrete model of human activity related to choice.
This model ties together three aspects of this activity:  behavioral,
mental and neural-computational. We could not construct such a model,
however, if we followed a contemporary paradigm which requires that its
parameters must be estimated experimentally. Let us consider this
problem in more detail. We seek a function of variables x1, x2, and x3
by assuming that this function, X1=f(x1,x2,x3), is linear in each of
its arguments in the sense that if the values of any two are fixed, X1
is linear in the third.  It follows from this assumption that X1 can be
represented as a polynomial

f(x1,x2,x3)=a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x1x2+a5x1x3+a6x2x3+a7x1x2x3.  (1.1)

5. The right side of (1.1) contains eight parameters a0, a2,..., a7
whose values are unknown. Suppose that we have established
experimentally that /a0/<0.001 with probability 0.99. For predicting
behavior this information might be sufficient. But the properties of
f(x1,x2,x3), which must be known for establishing connections between
the different aspects of the model, may depend on the answer to a
cardinal question: whether a0 is equal to 0 or not? Experimental data,
in principle, cannot answer this question.  Similar problems appear
concerning other parameters as well.

6. We will demonstrate later how the idea similar to the anthropic
principle in cosmology allowed us to find the exact values for the
parameters a0, a1,...,a7 in a particular psychological model and how
knowledge of an analytical form of a function allowed us to suggest a
concrete hypothesis about the nature of computational processes in the
human brain.

7. Our point of departure is the following statement, which we will
call the Principle of Freedom:

     We have free will and under certain circumstances also 
     freedom of choice.

8. We will try to show that on this base a theory can be constructed
from which falsifiable models of psychological phenomena related to
choice can be deduced.

9. To give the terms "free will," "freedom of choice," and "certain
circumstances" an operational meaning, imagine an abstract subject who
is to choose one of six alternatives marked 1, 2, ..., 6 in the
following way. He must pick from a continuum of dies with different
centers of gravity, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the set of dies and the set of all possible probability
distributions of choosing an alternative from the six.  If there are no
obstacles, the subject (i) plans to use a certain die; (ii) picks it
from the continuum, and (iii) casts it, thereby choosing one of the six
alternatives. Note that the subject can make a completely determined
choice, namely, he can plan to use only those dies which always show
the same face up.

10. Imagine now that a state of the external world that may or may not
interfere with the process of actually taking from the continuum the
die the subject planned to use. For each plan there are such states of
the world.

11. The statement asserting the subject's freedom of will means that he
can plan to use any of the dies from the continuum independently from
the state of the world.

12. The statement that under certain circumstances the subject has
freedom of choice means that there are states of the world that do not
interfere with the process of using the die the subject planned to use.
In this way we distinguish between "free will" and "freedom of choice."

13. Complete absence of freedom of choice means that some state of the
world exactly predetermines the die to be taken. In this case the
subject's choice does not depend on his intention.

14. We will call a choice realistic if the subject plans to use only
those dice that can be taken under a given state of the world.  A
subject who makes only realistic choices will be called a Realist.

15. This scheme reflects two different tendencies in psychology.
Miller, Galanter and Pribram (1960) emphasized the plan as a central
element of human activity. The distinction between a readiness (or
setting) to act, on the one hand, and the actual act, on the other,
evolved from gestalt-psychology and was developed by Uznadze (1968) and
his school (Prangishvili, 1967). In our scheme, the subject with a die
in his hands represents the state of readiness to act, and casting a
die the act itself.

II. A GENERAL MODEL

16. A subject facing a choice from a set of n alternatives (n>=2) will
be represented by the function

a=G(b,c), a and c are elements of D, b is an element of S.   (2.1)

17. The set D={(p1,p2,...,pn)}, where pi>=0, i=1,2,...,n, and
p1+p2+...+pn=1, is the set of all probability distributions on a given
set of n alternatives, and S is the set of all possible states of the
world. Variable a represents the probability distribution
characterizing the state of the subject's readiness to choose an
alternative. Variable b represents the world influence on a particular
choice. Variable c represents the probability distribution which the
subject plans to use for choosing an alternative.

18. The statement that the subject has a freedom of will corresponds to
the assumption that variables b and c are independent.

19. The statement that under certain circumstances the subject has
freedom of choice corresponds to the assumption that there exist an S1
subset of S such that for every b element of S1, the following identity
holds

G(b,x)==x,                                                  (2.2)

where x is any distribution from D and "==" means identical.

20. The existence of states of the world that predetermine the
subject's choice behavior implies that there exists an S2 subset of S
such that for every b element of S2 there is exactly one y(b) element
of D that satisfies the identity

G(b,x)==y(b),                                               (2.3)

where x is any distribution in D.

21. The Realist is represented by the Equation

G(b,x)=x,                                                   (2.4)

where x is element of D and b is element of S.

22. Let us put each element b which is element of S into correspondence
with the set D[b] using the following rule: if with a given b Equation
(2.4) does not have a solution, then D[b] is an empty set; otherwise,
D[b] consists of all the elements x which are elements of D for which
Equation (2.4) holds. Therefore we introduce a single-valued function
g(b):

D[b]= g(b).                                                 (2.5)

23. Not all sets D[b] are empty, because when b is element of S1,
D[b]=D (follows from (2.2)), and when b is element of S2, D[b] is a
one-element set {y(b)} (follows from (2.3)).

24. Let us emphasize that on the right-hand side of (2.5), there is
only one variable b corresponding to the state of the world. By
comparing (2.5) with (2.1) we see that in the case when a choice is
realistic, that is, when a=c, we can exclude variable c from
consideration; its values are subjective phenomena and as such,
non-observable. Imagine that we want to predict a Realist decision if
we know the function g(b) and having observed the value of variable b.
If D[b] is empty set, this means that with a given b realistic choice
is impossible, and that the Realist refuses to choose. If D[b] contains
only one element, this means that the subject will use one particular
distribution, hence Equation (2.5) allows us to make a precise
prognosis. If D[b]=D, this means that the subject has freedom of choice
and can decide to use any of the distributions in D. Therefore, the
state in which the subject has the ability to make a free choice cannot
in principle correspond to any kind of concrete probability
distribution. In this case observation of the world does not allow us
to make a more precise prognosis. If D[b] consists of more than one
element and D-D[b] is not an empty set, we can predict that the Realist
will not use distributions belonging to D-D[b]. We cannot say, however,
which distribution from D[b] he will use; in this case we say that the
subject has partial freedom of choice.

III. A MODEL OF BINARY CHOICE

25. We use the ideas described above to construct a concrete model of a
subject making binary choices (Lefebvre, 1992a) and a model of choice
among any number of alternatives (Lefebvre, 1994a). In the binary
choice model, we consider a subject choosing between a positive and a
negative pole. The subject is represented by the function

X1=f(x1,x2,x3),                                             (3.1)

where X1,x1,x2,x3 are elements of [0,1]. The value of X1 is interpreted
as the readiness to choose a positive pole with probability X1, and the
value of x3 as the subject's plan or intention to choose a positive
pole with probability x3. Variables x1 and x2 represent the world
influence on the subject. Thus, variable b in Equation (2.1) above
corresponds to the pair (x1,x2) in Equation (3.1).

26. We assume that in every choice situation the world influences the
subject by two kinds of impulses. An impulse of the first kind
stimulates the subject to choose a positive pole, one of the second
kind a negative pole. The value of x1 is the frequency of the impulses
toward a positive pole (at the time of the subject makes his choice).
The value of x2 is the mean frequency of the impulses toward a positive
pole, sent to the subject in similar previous situations (including the
present one). Thus, the value of x2 reflects the subject's earlier
experience, in other words, the subject's "knowledge" about a class of
similar experiences.

27. Next we introduce 

POSTULATE OF SIMPLICITY: 

Function (3.1) is linear in each of its three arguments.

As mentioned in the Introduction, it follows from this assumption that
f(x1,x2,x3) can be represented as in a (1.1), i.e. containing eight
unknown parameters. We can find these parameters by formulating certain
limitations for function (3.1). Those limitations will correspond to
the requirements posed to the subject who possesses free will and the
ability for free choice.  They are given by Equations (2.2) and (2.3).
First we formulate these limitations as axioms; then we will discuss
their meaning.

28. Equation (2.2) corresponds to

I. THE AXIOM OF FREE CHOICE

For any x3 element of [0,1], f(0,0,x3)==x3.                 (3.2)

The set S1, in this case, contains at least one element b=(0,0).

29. Expression (2.3) corresponds to the following two axioms:

II. THE AXIOM OF CREDULITY

For any x3 element of [0,1], f(0,1,x3)==0.                   (3.3)

III. THE AXIOM OF NON-EVIL-INCLINATIONS

For any x2,x3 elements of [0,1], f(1,x2,x3)==1.              (3.4)

The set S2 in this case consists of at least an element (0,1)
and a set of elements (1,x2), where x2 takes on values from [0,1].

30. The restrictions corresponding to Equations (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4)
stem from moral philosophy, which has a rich history of logical
manipulation involving the categories of good and evil. In that field
freedom of choice is usually linked with responsibility: a person is
responsible for his actions if at the moment of its performance he was
free to perform it and conversely (Losskii, 1927). Thus expression
(3.2) corresponds to the statement: If the state of the world inclines
the subject to perform a negative action (x1=0), and the subject knows
this (x2=0), then the subject is responsible for the choice. Expression
(3.3) states: If the state of the world inclines the subject to perform
a negative action (x1=0), but the subject believes that the world
always presses toward good (x2=1), then the subject yields to the
world's pressure (X1=0). Finally, expression (3.4) corresponds to the
statement: A human being is not a source of evil; temptation can come
only from an external agent. Hence if the world urges the subject to
perform a positive action (x1=1), only the positive action can be
performed (X1=1). Such recourse to moral philosophy may create the
impression that I suppose a human being to be an innately moral being.
Karl Popper wrote in his note about my book (Lefebvre, 1992a):

    No psychologist will like this. Everyone will say this means
    thinking of man as an essentially moral being. (Popper, 1992)

31. Here is my answer: The problem of morality in a religious or any
other conventional sense is not important for constructing a model.
Relying on moral philosophy is a technique which helps to find the
values of initial conditions.

32. Using the Postulate of Simplicity, Axioms I, II, and III we can
write a system of equations for parameters a0, a1, ..., a7:

f(0,0,x3)==x3,
f(0,1,x3)==0,                                                (3.5)
f(1,x2,x3)==1.

33. After solving this system we find that a0=0, a1=1, a2=0, a3=1,
a4=0, a5=-1, a6=-1, a7=1. Substituting these values into (1.1) we
obtain:

X1=x1+(1-x1-x2+x1x2)x3.                                     (3.6)

34. Heretofore, we have found a specific function from the class of
functions given by Equation (1.1) without experimental estimation of
the parameters a0, a2, ..., a7 but using an abstract principle of
freedom, instead (Lefebvre, 1992a).

35. To represent the Realist, (X1=x3), expression (3.6) can be written
as

       x1/(x1+x2-x1x2), if x1+x2>0
X1 = {                                                      (3.7)
       any number from [0,1], if x1+x2=0.

36. Equation (3.7) corresponds to expression (2.5), where b is an
element of the set of all pairs (x1,x2). If x1+x2>0, then the set
D[(x1,x2)] consists of a single distribution (X1,1-X1) given by
Equation (3.7), and if x1+x2=0, then D[(0,0)] coincides with the set of
all the distributions.

37. Recently Schreider (1994) showed that in another interpretation,
Equation (3.6) can be deduced from pure probabilistic considerations.
We can also deduce this equation from an earlier version of our model
(Lefebvre, 1977a; 1980; 1982). Based on this version a special method
of simulating human decision making has been developed (Shankin, 1994).
Experimental aspects related to the early version of the model were
discussed by Adams-Webber (1987) and Zajonc (1987), and its logical
and epistemological aspects were analyzed by Rapoport (1982; 1990),
Townsend (1983; 1990), Levitin (1987), McClain (1987), Wheeler (1987;
1990), Batchelder (1987), and Kauffman (1990).

38. Further we will show that the functions (3.6) and (3.7) can be
directly related to observable psychological phenomena (Lefebvre, 1990,
1992a, 1994a).

IV. RELATION TO BRADLEY-TERRY-LUCE (BTL) MODEL

39. The BTL model is a distinctive starting point in the psychology of
choice. It helps to compare various probabilistic models of choice
behavior. In the case of binary choice, the BTL model is based on the
assumption that the probabilities of choosing alternatives belonging to
a certain set are proportional to their utilities. Thus, if utilities
of alternatives A and B are respectively v1 and v2, then the
probability that A will be chosen from the set {A,B} is given by

p(A,B)=v1/(v1+v2).                                          (4.1)

40. Imagine now that the Realist, represented by function (3.7), is
making a choice between A and B. Without loss of generality, we can
assume v1>=v2. Let A be the positive pole, and B the negative pole.

41. We assume that the world's pressure toward the positive pole is
given by

x1=(v1-v2)/v1.                                              (4.2)

We will explain the reasons for choosing this expression at the end of
section 8.

42. If the subject has had no prior experience in similar situations,
then in accordance with definition of x2, x1=x2.  Substituting the
values of x1 and x2, given in (4.2), into (3.7) we find the relation
between the probability X1 that the subject is ready to choose
alternative A and utilities v1 and v2:

      v1/(v1+v2), if v1>v2
X1 = {                                                      (4.3)
      any number from [0,1], if v1=v2.

43. We see that on the basis of assumption (4.2) our model coincides
with the BTL model for the case of v1>v2. We can even say that the BTL
model is deduced from ours. However, for the case v1=v2 the model
predictions are different. According to the BTL model each alternative
will be chosen with probability 1/2, whereas our model implies that in
this case the subject has freedom of choice: he can select any
probability of choosing alternative A (Lefebvre, 1994a).

V. CATEGORIZATION OF STIMULI WITH MEASURABLE INTENSITY

44. Almost forty years ago Stevens and Galanter (1957) found that the
results of magnitude estimation of stimuli intensities are related
non-linearly to their categorical estimation. In the first case,
subjects estimate intensities comparing them with a unit of
measurement. In the second case, subjects attribute the intensity of
each stimulus to a certain level. Such levels can be represented by a
set of numbers, where 1 corresponds to the weakest stimulus, and k to
the strongest. If we plot magnitude estimations against categorical
estimations, the graph will be an upward convex curve rather than a
straight line. Further, the convexity is greater when the mean values
of stimuli are shifted toward the weakest stimulus.  The interrelation
between these two methods of estimation was debated for a long time
(Stevens & Galanter, 1957; Galanter & Messick, 1961; Parducci, 1965;
Marks, 1968; Haubensak, 1992; Parducci, 1992). However, no persuasive
theoretical explanation has been offered.

45. Lefebvre (1992a) attempted to explain this non-linear relation with
the help of the model described in this paper. A subject is represented
by equation

X1=x1/(x1+x2-x1x2),                                          (5.1)

where x1+x2>0 (cf. (3.7)). Suppose the subject is able "to answer a
question" about his readiness to choose a positive pole. Let him do
this by marking a point X1 on the interval [0,1]. In this way we extend
our model by assuming that the final result of the subject's activity,
in addition to the actual choice, can also be the subject's "report"
about the value X1. We interpret such a report as a categorization.

46. Consider first a case of bipolar categorization. Let magnitude
estimations of stimuli found in earlier experiments be between Smax and
Smin. The subject's task in the given experiment is to categorize each
stimulus as "strong" or "weak." Suppose the attractiveness of
alternative "strong" is v1=Smax-Smin, while that of "weak" is
v2=Smax-S, where S is the intensity of the presented stimulus: the more
intensive is the stimulus, the less attractive is the alternative
"weak." Interpreting the alternative "strong" as the positive pole and
using Equation (4.2) we obtain

x1=(S-Smin)/(Smax-Smin).                                    (5.2)

47. We will call this value a normalized magnitude estimation. In
accordance with the definition in section III, x2 takes on the mean
value of normalized magnitude estimations of stimuli preceding a given
one (including itself). The value of X1 is the subject's readiness to
choose "strong" with probability X1.

48. When a scale with a large number of categories is used, the subject
marks the value of X1 on the scale. For well-randomized long sequences
of stimuli presentation, we can assume x2 to be constant in a given
experiment. In this case expression (5.1) can be regarded as an
equation of a hyperbola with variables X1 and x1 and a constant
parameter x2. Larger convexity of the hyperbola corresponds to smaller
x2. Such hyperbolas appear to fit published experimental results on
categorization (sf. Lefebvre, 1992a). It is also noteworthy that values
of variables x1 and x2 can be estimated from experimental data. Thus,
the model contains no free parameters.

VI. THE GOLDEN SECTION AND CATEGORIZATION OF STIMULI WITHOUT 
    MEASURABLE INTENSITY

49. For many centuries the golden section [g=(SQRT5-1)/2=0.618...] was
regarded as especially attractive (cf., for example, Ghyka, 1946).
Attempts to refute or confirm this hypothesis began with Fechner
(1876); but the question of whether this phenomenon really exists
remained unanswered (cf. reviews in Valentine, 1962; Plug, 1980;
Lefebvre, 1992b). A new wave of interest in the golden section was
generated by the works of Adams-Webber and Benjafield, who found that
subjects evaluate their acquaintances positively in bipolar constructs
with a frequency close to 0.62. They hypothesized that the theoretical
value of this frequency is identical with the golden section
(Adams-Webber & Benjafield, 1973; Benjafield & Adams-Webber, 1976;
Adams-Webber, 1990).

50. Analyzing other subsequent experiments we found that the
frequencies of choice of the positive pole lie in the interval
0.60-0.64 (see review in Lefebvre, 1992b) and suggested that the golden
section is not limited to evaluations of other people but appears in
binary choice or categorical estimation of stimuli without measurable
qualities (Lefebvre, 1985; 1990). We also proposed a model similar to
the one described here from which an explanation of the phenomenon is
deduced (Lefebvre, 1985).

51. Suppose a subject represented by Equation (3.6) faces a choice
between two alternatives without objective measure in the context of
the given situation. Let the subject relate the first alternative to a
positive pole, the second to a negative pole, and let the
attractiveness of these alternatives be v1=1 and v2=x3. The latter
means that the greater the probability with which the subject is
planning to choose the first alternative, the more attractive becomes
for him the second alternative. Let also the attractiveness of the
positive alternative be always greater than that of negative one, that
is, v2=x3<1. In view of (4.2), we have x1=(v1-v2)/v1=1-x3. Next suppose
the subject had never faced a similar choice in the past. In view of
the definition of x2 (see section 3) we must set x1=x2. By substituting
the values x1=x2=1-x3 into Equation (3.6), we obtain

X1=1-x3+x3^3, where x3^3 means "x3 to the power of 3."       (6.1)

52. Suppose that the subject is a Realist, that is, X1=x3. Then
Equation (6.1) is transformed into a cubic equation

x3^3-2x3+1=0.                                               (6.2)

53. Positive roots of this equation are x3=1 and x3=(SQRT5-1)/2.  The
first one does not satisfy the condition x3<1. Therefore, the subject
chooses a positive pole with the probability equal to the golden
section value.

54. Consider an experiment conducted by Kunst-Wilson and Zajonc (1980),
in which the ideas presented here played no part. The stimuli were 20
irregular octagons. During the first stage of the experiment, ten of
these octagons were presented one by one with a very short expositions,
1 millisecond, five times each. During the second stage, octagons were
presented in pairs: one which was presented earlier and one new one.
The subjects were not told that one of the octagons was among those
seen earlier; their task was to indicate which octagon they liked more.
The octagon seen earlier was preferred with frequency 0.60. Table 1
shows the frequencies of preference for objects seen earlier in a
number of similar experiments:

                             Table 1

    Experimenter                  Frequency
    
    Kunst-Wilson et al.(1980)     0.60
    Seamon et al.(1983)           0.61
    Mandler et al.(1987)          0.62
    Bonanno et al.(1986)          0.66, 0.63, 0.62, 0.61, 0.63, 0.62

55. As can be seen, the frequencies cluster around 0.62. We found no
indications in the literature that this fact was noticed.

56. Our model suggests an explanation of this phenomenon. The first
stage of the experiments determined the polarization of the objects:
the object seen earlier became the positive pole; the new one the
negative. The stimuli had no measurable properties which might
determine the preference between the objects. Consequently the pressure
of the world was determined by the subject's intention, which led to a
preference for the positive pole with probability close to the golden
section ratio.

VII. A MODEL OF AUTOMATIC AWARENESS

57. In 1908 a psychiatrist from Prague, H. Loewy, discovered a new
psychological phenomenon (see Reznik, 1969). One of his patients
complained that she had lost all her inner feelings. Her statements,
however, contrasted with the objective observations made by Loewy: her
tone, look, and style of behavior suggested that she had deep feelings
making her suffer. Loewy was confronted with a paradox: the patient
suffers because she is convinced that she does not.

58. According to Mayer-Gross,

     The paradoxical occurrence of such complaints in patients who
     obviously suffer from the alleged death of their feelings has
     aroused great interest in all writers on the subject. 
     (Mayer-Gross, 1935, p.108)

59. Here are typical patients' reports:

     "My emotions are gone, nothing affects me." "All the feeling is
     gone, no remorse, no passion. I have only the feeling of being
     alive, that my heart beats..." "My feeling is dead, I have no
     interest for my husband and the baby." "Nothing impresses me, ...
     I have lost all my love for the children, they seem miles away."
     "I am unable to have any emotions, everything is detached from
     me." "The trees in the garden seem unreal, I get no feeling, no
     thrill, no joy ... ." "I cannot see the beauty of flowers -- the
     feeling does not get past my eyes." (Mayer-Gross, 1935,
     pp. 107-108)

60. Sometimes the patients themselves find that the meaning of their
statements contradicts their form:

     "One of my patients remarked on her own surprise at this
      paradox, viz. that she should weep in the very act of complaining
      about loss of feeling." (Mayer-Gross, 1935, p.108)

61. One of the attempts to construct an explanatory scheme for
this phenomenon was made by Reznik (1969). He assumed that a person
in a normal state has the ability to sense his own feelings; that
is, in addition to the feelings as such, there is also a secondary
ability to "feel" the process of feeling, although this ability is
not consciously registered. In the case Loewy observed, the patient
had lost this secondary ability, so that she did not sense her own
feelings and believed that they were missing.

62. Although this phenomenon has been known to psychiatrists for a long
time, it did not attract attention of psychologists studying the
cognitive realm of human beings. Perhaps the inner mechanism of
"awareness" of one's own feelings is akin to the mechanism of awareness
of one's own visual perception (Gazzaniga, 1970; Griffin, 1976). In
that case, the loss of the ability to see one's own feeling is close to
the phenomenon of paradoxical vision or blindsight, the essence of
which is that subjects with damage to the visual cortex can move around
and not collide with objects but at the same time be sure that they
don't see these objects (Zihl, 1980; 1981; Zihl & von Cramon, 1985;
Paillard et al., 1983; Perenin & Jeannerod, 1978).

63. Another phenomenon which might be close to those already described
is the "feeling of knowing": sometimes subjects report that they have a
feeling that they will be able to retrieve unrecalled information under
specific conditions (Hart, 1965; see also Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994).

64. On the other hand, although all those phenomena are usually
described in similar terms, such as awareness, metacognition, and
attention (Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994), we cannot rule out the
possibility that by their neural physiological nature they belong to
different functional systems in the human brain (Gazzaniga, 1995).

65. We will show further that the theoretical representation of the
subject described in the previous sections allows us to develop a model
of the subject capable of becoming aware of his own feelings (Lefebvre,
1980; 1992a,b).

66. We consider a human being possessing a specialized functional
processor generating an "image of the self," which, in turn, generates
a second "image of the self." The first "image of the self" is related
to the subject's direct feelings; the second order "image of the self"
allows the subject to "see" himself feeling.  The generation of the
first and second order of the "image of the self" goes on
automatically; it is not related to any voluntary constructive activity
(Lefebvre, 1967; 1977b). Under certain disruptive conditions, however,
a secondary image is not generated. This gives rise to the paradox
discovered by Loewy: a person has feelings but does not sense himself
having them. A connection between this scheme of the process of
automatic awareness and the model of the subject developed in the
previous sections is given by the following

67. STATEMENT: The function X1=x1+(1-x1-x2+x1x2)x3 of three variables
x1, x2, and x3 can be represented as composition

X1=F(x1,F(x2,x3)),                                          (7.1)

of one function, F(x,y), of two variables x and y, where 

F(x,y)=1-y+xy.                                              (7.2)

This representation is unique. (The proof is given in Lefebvre,
1992a).

68. We consider the function 

X2=F(x2,x3)                                                 (7.3)

as a formal analogue for the subject's image of the self. In this
interpretation, the subject's self-description and the objective
description by an external observer are presented by the same function
F(x,y). We thus obtain a model of a subject "aware" of the self. In the
case in which the subject is a Realist (X1=x3), Equations (7.1) and
(7.3) transform into Equations (7.4) and (7.5) respectively:

X1=F(x1,F(x2,X1)),                                          (7.4)

X2=F(x2,X1).                                                (7.5)

69. It follows from these Equations that, if x1+x2>0, then
X1=x1/(x1+x2-x1x2),
							    (7.6)
X2=x2/(x1+x2-x1x2),

and if x1+x2=0, then

X2=1-X1,                                                    (7.7)

where X1 is an arbitrary number from [0,1].

70. Variables X1 and X2 can be represented as identities

X1==F(x1,X2), X2==F(x2,X1).                                 (7.8)

71. In order to simplify the analysis, we represent X1 as a composition
of F1=F(x1,u) and u=X2, and X2 as a composition of F2=F(x2,v) and v=X1
by using a standard notation for function composition:

X1==F1oX2, X2==F2oX1.                                       (7.9)

72. It follows from (7.9) that X1 can be put into correspondence with
the sequence of its representations as compositions of F1, F2, and Xj:

X[1]==F1 o X2,
X[2]==F1 o F2 o X1,                                          (7.10)
. . . . . . . 
X[n]==F1 o F2 o F1 o ... o Fi o Xj,
                 _
where i,j=1,2; j=i.

73. A subject corresponding to composition X[1] has an image of the
self X2, but this image does not have an image of the self. A subject
corresponding to composition X[2] has an image of the self F2oX1, and
this image, in turn, has an image of the self X1. We identify an image
of the self, F2oX1, with the subject's inner feelings, and an image's
image of the self; X1, with the "sense" of one's own feelings (using
Reznik's term). Loewy's paradox appears when there is a disruption such
that a subject in the state X[1] cannot proceed to the state X[2]. The
subject has feelings connected with his image of the self, but his
image of the self does not have feelings, and the subject is incapable
of "seeing" the self with the feelings.

74. In the general case, we put an act of automatic awareness into
correspondence with the transformation X[k]->X[k+1] (Lefebvre, 1967;
1977b). Then composition X[n] will correspond to a state of the subject
appearing as a result of (n-1) acts of awareness starting with X[1].

75. When the subject is in the state X[n], every image of the self (in
the hierarchy of images) is presented together with the influence of
the world. Therefore, in addition to the hierarchy of self-images, the
subject has a hierarchy of world's images. These images are connected
with the subject's feelings of the world. So, the subject has feelings
of the two types and both are included into multiple awareness: some
are connected with self-reference, and the others with the reference to
the external world (Lefebvre, 1967; 1977b).

76. Every composition from (7.10) can be regarded as a formal operator
mapping a set of pairs of values (x1,x2) onto a set of pairs of vectors
(A,a), (See Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Connection between composition X[n] and vectors of feelings A
and a. The upper lane corresponds to vector A which is a theoretical
analogue of the feelings linked to self-reference. The lower lane
corresponds to vector a which is a theoretical analogue of the feelings
linked to the reference of the external world.
---------------------------------------------------------------

77. The upper lane corresponds to vector A=(X1,X2,X1,...) whose
periodical components are the values of functions F1, F2, and Xj
(j=1,2) occurring in composition. This vector is a theoretical analogue
of the subject's feelings (and their multiple reflexion) linked to
self-reference. The lower lane corresponds to vector a=(x1,x2,x1,...)
whose components also constitute a periodical sequence. This vector is
an analogue of the subject's feelings (and their multiple reflexion)
linked with reference to the external world (Lefebvre, 1992b).

78. In the next section we will try to move further and show that the
model that we have constructed allows us to make some assumptions about
computational brain work.

VIII. AWARENESS, THERMODYNAMICS, AND BRAIN NEURAL NETWORKS

79. One of the hypotheses concerning the general principles of the
functioning of real brain neural networks is that the ensemble of
neuron states is a similar statistical ensemble of physical particles
obeying the laws of statistical physics and thermodynamics (Cowan,
1967). The models of some types of such networks already exist
(Hopfield, 1982; Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Hinton & Sejnowski, 1983;
Ackley et al., 1985; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992).

80. In the framework of this "thermodynamic" representation, mental
phenomena can be connected with macro-characteristics of an ensemble of
neuron states, such as "heat," "temperature," and "entropy." If we
accept this hypothesis, we may expect that formal schemes of mental
processes reflect thermodynamic correlations between different
macro-characteristics of neuron ensembles. In the previous section we
constructed a formal model of one particular mental phenomenon, the
awareness of one's own feelings. No specific information taken from
statistical physics and thermodynamics was used to do this. Therefore,
if we show that our model can be easily and clearly translated into the
language of thermodynamics, this will serve as an argument in favor of
plausibility of both our model and the thermodynamic hypothesis as a
whole. Further we will make such a translation by demonstrating that
the process of multiple awareness described in the previous section is
isomorphic to the process of gradual minimization of work lost by a
heat engine system.

81. Let us consider an abstract heat machine consisting of a sequence
of heat engines and two tapes, on which the engines print their working
parameters (see Fig. 2).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 2. A heat machine. Reservoirs correspond to vertical lines.
Each engine prints its efficiency Rm=(Qm-Q{m+1})/Qm on the bottom tape,
and the values Mm=Rm/[(T1-T2)/T1] on the upper tape.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

82. In this sequence each succeeding engine performs work compensating
for the loss of available work by the preceding engine by receiving
from a reservoir the amount of heat equal to that yielded to this
reservoir by the preceding engine. The temperatures of reservoirs make
a decreasing geometrical progression: 

T1/T2=T2/T3= ...,                                           (8.1)

where T1>T2.  Engine m performs work

Wm=Qm-Q{m+1}, where {m+1} is a subscript.                   (8.2)

83. We do not require an engine to be necessarily reversible, so

Wm<=Um, where "<=" means "lesser than or equal to,"         (8.3)

and where

        Tm-T{m+1}      T1-T2
Um = Qm --------- = Qm -----                                (8.4)
           Tm           T1

is the work which would be performed by a reversible engine if it were
located between reservoirs m and (m+1). The loss of available work by
engine m is equal to

                    Q{m+1}   Qm
dWm = Um - Wm = T2(------- - --) = T2dH,                    (8.5)
                     T2      T1

where dH is the change of entropy of the whole system caused by engine
m performing work Wm. Engine (m+1) receives from a reservoir (m+1) heat
Q{m+1} and performs work dWm. Each engine measures the work it performs
and registers it in two ways: as a portion of the heat received from
the reservoir, Rm, and as a portion of the work which would be
performed by a reversible engine under the same conditions, Mm. The
engine prints on the lower tape the value

Rm=Wm/Qm=(Qm-Q{m+1})/Qm,                                    (8.6)

that is, the efficiency of engine m, and on the upper tape the value

          Wm              Rm
Mm = -------------- = ----------,                           (8.7)
     Qm[(T1-T2)/T1]   (T1-T2)/T1

that is, the ratio of the efficiency of engine m to the efficiency of
reversible engine.

84. We consider these printed quantities to be theoretical analogues
for subjective processes. We proved that the "text" printed by such a
heat machine is formally equivalent to the "text" generated by a
composition X[n] (Lefebvre, 1994b). The two following statements are
true concerning this sequence of heat engines.

85. STATEMENT 1. Sequences Rm and Mm are periodic and

      R1 if m is odd
Rm = {
      R2 if m is even ,
                                                            (8.8)
      M1 if m is odd
Mm = {

M2=R2/(R1+R2-R1R2).

We can see that equations (8.11) are equivalent to equations (7.6).

87. Consider an arbitrary heat machine and establish the correspondence

R1=x1, R2=x2.                                               (8.12)

88. By using (8.9) we find that

Q1/Q2=1-x1, T2/T1=(1-x1)(1-x2).                             (8.13)

Figure 3. A heat machine which prints out vectors of feelings on
tapes.
---------------------------------------------------------------

89. Let us choose an arbitrary pair (x1,x2), where neither x1 nor x2 is
equal to 1 and x1+x2>0, and two arbitrary pairs (Q1, Q2) and (T1, T2)
which satisfy equations (8.13). Construct now a finite machine in which
those four values are used (Fig. 3). In accordance with (7.6), (8.11),
and (8.12), composition X[n] in Fig. 1 and heat machine in Fig. 3, with
given values of x1 and x2, generate the same pair of vectors of
feelings A and a. Let us choose now x1=0 and x2=0. In this case T1=T2,
which follows from (8.13). Therefore, the subject's state in which he
has the ability to make free choice corresponds to the state of heat
equilibrium in which engines cannot perform work.

90. By establishing one-to-one correspondence between a sequence of
functions constituting the composition on Fig. 1 and a sequence of heat
engines constituting the heat machine on Fig. 3, we settle the
isomorphism between the analytical and the thermodynamic models.

91. Let us return to Equation (4.2). Its meaning becomes clear from the
thermodynamic model. Let utility v1 correspond to the heat Q1 received
by engine 1 from reservoir 1 and utility v2 to the heat Q2 yielded by
engine 1 to the reservoir 2. We showed in this section that x1
corresponds to the efficiency R1 of engine 1 (see (8.9) and (8.12)).
Equation (4.2) reflects this parallel.

IX. CONCLUSION

92. We will conclude by adding to the formulation of the Anthropic
Principle in cosmology the formulation of the Principle of Freedom:

     What we can expect to observe must be restricted by conditions
     necessary for our presence as observers. We have free will and
     under some circumstances also freedom of choice.

93. The first sentence helps us construct concrete models of Universe;
the second concrete models of the human being. However, the combined
statement is more than a sum of its two parts. We can now say

     What we expect to observe must be restricted by conditions under
     which we at least sometimes have a free choice.

94. This means that we are not only observers but also to a certain
degree creators of the reality we observe. This is the content of the
connections between psychology and cosmology on the level of abstract
principles.

    KEYWORDS: Addiction, compulsive behavior, disease, incentive-
    sensitization, reinforcement, rational choice, matching law

    ABSTRACT: Research findings on addiction are contradictory.
    According to biographical records and widely used diagnostic
    manuals, addicts use drugs compulsively. These accounts are
    consistent with genetic research and laboratory experiments in
    which repeated administration of addictive drugs caused changes
    in neural substrates associated with reward. However,
    epidemiological and experimental data show that the
    consequences of drug consumption can significantly modify drug
    intake in addicts. The disease model can account for the
    compulsive features of addiction, but not occasions in which
    price and punishment reduced drug consumption in addicts.
    Conversely, learning models of addiction can account for the
    influence of price and punishment, but not compulsive drug
    taking. The occasion for this paper is that recent developments
    in behavioral choice theory resolve the apparent contradictions
    in the addiction literature. The basic argument includes the
    following four statements. First, repeated consumption of an
    addictive drug decreases its future value and the future value
    of competing activities. Second, the frequency of an activity
    is a function of its relative (not absolute) value. This
    implies that an activity that reduces the values of competing
    behaviors can increase in frequency even if its own value also
    declines. Third, a recent experiment (Heyman & Tanz, 1995)
    shows that the effective reinforcement contingencies are
    relative to a frame of reference, and this frame of reference
    can change so as to favor optimal or sub-optimal choice.
    Fourth, if the frame of reference is local, reinforcement
    contingencies will favor excessive drug use, but if the frame
    of reference is global, the reinforcement contingencies will
    favor controlled drug use. The transition from a global to
    local frame of reference explains relapse and other compulsive
    features of addiction.

This is a solicitation of references, information, suggestions, etc.
Please reply to me by EMail and do not reply directly to the list!

I have a graduate student in mathematics who has been sitting in on
my philosophy of mind class.  He is working in nonlinear dynamics, and
seems to be interested in applying it to a project in modeling conceptual
change.  (The philosophical inspiration he mentioned was Hegel's notion
of the development of synthesis out of thesis and antithesis.)

It seems to me that this sort of project would need to be very concrete
to be useful -- say, to take some pre-existing data in concept acquisition
or concept change, and perhaps a pre-existing model for concepts
(say, as partitions of a feature space??), and apply his particular
mathematical methods to them.

However, this is not my baliwick.  I'd like to give him whatever guidance
and encouragement I can, and would appreciate any suggestions.

He is NOT, by the way, looking to do modeling of NEURAL systems, per
se, which he could do with Rod Jensen here.  I also suspect that
artifical life is not really up his alley, though perhaps there are
applications of that which would address his issues.

Thanks in advance.
