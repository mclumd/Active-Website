README for Hypermail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Thanks for grabbing Hypermail! To compile this for your
system:

	1) Edit the default variables in "config.h" to your liking.
	2) Type "make".

	If you want to install the binary and man page:

	1) Edit the BINDIR and MANDIR paths for your system in
	   the Makefile. Make sure you have the permissions to
	   write in these directories.
	2) Type "make install". If you're compiling on a DEC Alpha
           machine, type "make install.alpha".

	A small CGI program, "mail", is included with this source
for you to use with Hypermail. To compile and install it:

	1) Edit the MAILCOMMAND variable in "config.h" to tailor
	   how your mailer program will be called.
	2) Edit the Makefile and change the variable CGIDIR to
	   point to the directory that holds your site's CGI programs.
	3) Type "make mail" to compile the mail program.
	4) Type "make mail.install" to install the program in your
	   CGI directory. If you're compiling on a DEC Alpha machine,
	   type "make mail.install.alpha".

	To install the HTML documentation:

	1) Edit the Makefile and change HTMLDIR to point to the
	   directory in which you want the documentation.
	2) Type "make html.install". You should be able to view the
	   HTML documentation using any World-Wide Web browser. If you've
	   compiled on a DEC Alpha machine, type "make html.install.alpha".
