Things to do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Correctly grep RFC 822 headers, fold lines, and collapse white space
Use the Content-length: header to help figure out forwarded messages
Display HTML when the "Content-type: text/html" shows up
        (allow for MIME HTML stuff, boundaries)
Make the parser better - make it handle more than one instance per line
Add date/subject/author filters for articles that are read in
