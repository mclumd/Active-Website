A number of my papers are available via anonymous ftp. To obtain copies,
type
	ftp yoohoo.cs.umd.edu

and respond with "ftp" at the user (Name) prompt. For the password, please
type your email address (<your login name>@<your host address>).

Once you are connected, enter the perlis directory ("cd perlis") and you
will find there the file README (this file) as well as a subdirectory
called "papers". Enter the papers subdirectory ("cd papers") and then
use the "get" command to transfer (copy) to your machine any files
there that you like ("get <file>"). To facilitate this, I append below
a guide to the papers (thanks to Matt Ginsberg for the template).

Note that the more recent papers tend to be in dvi format and can be 
printed as you would any LaTeXed file. The older ones tend to be in 
raw troff and may be harder to print (use eqn and -me); if you have
trouble feel free to ask me to send you hard copy. Starred (*) items 
are surveys.

Thanks for your interest.
