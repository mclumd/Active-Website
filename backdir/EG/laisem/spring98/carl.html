<p>Title: "Gardenfors' Theory of Belief Revision"

Abstract:
This lecture summarizes Peter Gardenfors' book Knowledge in Flux,
which presents seminal work by Gardenfors, Alchourron, and Makinson on
belief revision.

Belief revision concerns the rules by which rational agents change
their beliefs in the presence of new information.  Gardenfors argues
that minimal, consistent change to the agent's belief system is the
primary criterion of whether the agent's revision is rational.  He
presents a mathematical formalization of these ideas which
circumscribes the set of rational "revision functions", while leaving
open the possiblity of more detailed models making use of nonlogical
factors.  Gardenfors claims that the dynamics of such a belief system
can serve as a theoretical basis for propositional logic, and have
applications to problems about conditionals.
