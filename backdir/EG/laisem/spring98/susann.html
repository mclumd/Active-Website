Abstract:

The computational discourse framework described in this talk was first
developed in support of a non-speech, mixed-modality interface to the
Cyc common sense knowledge base. This framework including the
"discourse pegs" model of context representation, extends formal
linguistic theories of discourse semantics-- namely File Change
Semantics and Discourse Representation Theory--to enable real-time
processing of spontaneous language phenomena: multi-turn dialogue
sequences, attentional focus phenomena, complex dependence
relationships between referring expressions, dialogue disfluencies,
and troubleshooting dialogue segments of numerous sorts. The context
representation and algorithms for dialogue management functions
emphasize robustness in the environment of incomplete knowledge, a
dynamic world of reference, imperfect speech recognition or sentence
analysis, or temporary misconceptions on the part of either the user
or the automated dialogue agent itself. This framework has been
adapted to several applications following the original knowledge
editor for Cyc, including non-dialogue text processing, facilitation
of bilingual dialogue in voice-to-voice machine translation, and
spoken dialogue interfaces to databases and simulation systems. In
this talk I will describe the discourse framework and discuss its
implementation to support these spoken dialogue applications.
