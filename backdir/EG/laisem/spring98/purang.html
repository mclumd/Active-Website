Abstract: In this paper, Thielscher presents a framework to represent
and reason about dynamic systems. His theory handles concurrency,
delayed effects and nondeterminism. A semantics for this theory is
given. He also addresses the temporal projection problem, the planning
problem and the postdiction problem within that framework. The paper
is illustrated with variations on the Yale Shooting Problem.
