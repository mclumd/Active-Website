Intelligent Software Agents vs User-Controlled Direct Manipulation:

We all could use a little help.  Some advocates of intelligent 
agents belive that progress is being made in understanding what is
necessary to provide intelligent assistance to computer users, but
questions remain whether we are "climbing a ladder to get to the
moon" or on the brink of bringing together all the components of
a breakthrough in intelligent software agents.
<p>
At the same time, advocates of direct manipulation and information 
visualization promise to bring greater comprehensibility, 
predictability, and control to advanced interfaces.  Is direct 
manipualtion already stretched to its limits or can users be served 
best with direct manipulation programming, control panels, 
dynamic queries, and other visual tools?
