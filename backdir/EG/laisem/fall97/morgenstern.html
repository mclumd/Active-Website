<b>Inheritance Comes of Age: Applying Nonmonotonic Techniques to Problems in Industry</b>
<p>

Nonmonotonic reasoning is virtually absent from industry and has
been since its inception;  the result is that the field is
becoming marginalized within AI.  I argue that this is because
researchers in the area focus exclusively on commonsense problems
which are irrelevant to industry and because few efficient
algorithms and tools have been developed.  A sensible strategy
is thus to focus on industry problems and to develop solutions
within tractable subtheories of nonmonotonic logic.
<p>
I examine one of the few examples of nonmonotonic reasoning
in industry --- inheritance of business rules in the medical
insurance domain --- and show how the paradigm of inheritance can be
extended to a broader and more powerful kind of nonmonotonic reasoning.
This is done by introducing *formula-augmented semantic networks* (FANs),
semantic networks which attach well-formed formulae to nodes.
I investigate the concept of inheriting wffs in such networks
and give a method for computing the sets of wffs that apply to a
given node. I explore the connections between FANs and other forms
of nonmonotonic reasoning, and consider which forms are most suitable
for the application at hand.  Finally, I discuss the underlying lessons
that can be generalized to other problems in the commercial world.
