This talk will first briefly describe information extraction systems
--- natural language understanding systems that take as input a
collection of unrestricted texts and ``summarize'' each text with
respect to a prespecified topic or domain of interest.  We then will
focus on the problem of noun phrase coreference, one of the most cited
underlying problems for information extraction and for many other
practical natural language processing tasks.  The goal for noun phrase
coreference algorithms is to determine which noun phrases in a text or
dialogue refer to the same real-world entity.  We will introduce an
algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution that differs from
existing methods in that it views coreference resolution as a
clustering task. In initial evaluations on a standard coreference
resolution corpus, our results are extremely encouraging.  The
coreference clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible
mechanism for combining context-independent coreference constraints
and context-dependent preferences for accurate partitioning of noun
phrases into coreference equivalence classes.
