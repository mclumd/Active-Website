<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Minimal Model Reasoning and its Efficient Implementation''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>
 The talk deals with the minimal model semantics MIN for positive 
 disjunctive logic programs.  Under this semantics a disjunction of 
 ground literals is considered true if and only if it holds in all 
 minimal Herbrand models of the program.

<P>
The positive disjunctions in MIN form the so-called minimal
model state.  We show how they can be derived efficiently by using
delta-iteration together with a tree representation, called clause
tree, for sets of disjunctions.
The negative disjunctions in MIN form the so-called extended
generalized closed-world-assumption.  They can be characterized in
terms of two types of characteristic sets for disjunctions: the 
support-for-negation sets and the support-for-minimality sets.  
We present techniques for the efficient derivation of the 
collection of all such characteristic sets.
Finally, we show that the mixed disjunctions in MIN can be derived 
by logical deduction from the positive and the negative ones.

<P>
The minimal model semantics is one of the semantics that is
provided by the system DisLog which has been developed at the
University of Tuebingen.  DisLog is a toolkit for non-monotonic 
reasoning with disjunctive logic programs.  It integrates many of 
the common semantics for logic programs (minimal model, stable 
model, possible model and well-founded semantics) and allows for 
the fast implementation of further semantics.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to attend.
