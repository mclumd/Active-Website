AGM (Alchourron-Gardenfors-Makinson) approach to non-monotonic reasoning
and belief revision. In this first meeting, we will have a brief
overview of the approach and preliminary discussion, plus organizational
plans for a more detailed study in one or more subsequent meetings.
Copies of the target paper can be obtained from Carolina Ruiz in
Room 3264 AVW Bldg, or at the Oct. 10 session.

Everyone is welcome to attend. But participants are encouraged to
make a cursory read of the paper in advance, if possible.
