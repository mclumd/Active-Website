<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Intelligent Query Processing over Complex Databases''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
Formulating queries over complex databases can be a difficult task
requiring extensive syntactic and semantic knowledge.  Syntactic
knowledge is needed to ensure that a query is well-formed and
references existing relations and attributes.  Semantic knowledge is
needed to ensure that a query satisfies user intent.  While a user
often has a general understanding of the contents of the database,
design decisions to structure and store data in optimal ways may
conflict with the user's intuition or expectations.  Consequently,
database specialists are needed to formulate queries, and ad hoc 
access to the database is impeded.

<p>
This presentation describes a research project in automated query
formulation that significantly reduces the amount of knowledge required
by database users.  In particular, an extended Entity-Relationship
model is employed to formulate queries automatically in response to
high-level requests that specify only attributes of interest.  By using
knowledge of the target query language, syntactically correct queries
are assured.  Similarly, by using a knowledge-rich conceptual model of
the database, the most likely intent of a request can be inferred and
generated queries can be semantically optimized.

<p>
If time permits, a demonstration will be given of a prototype system
known as QUICK.  In addition to facilitating research, QUICK has been
used (1) as a design tool and query formulation module of an
intelligent interface developed by the Space Telescope Science
Institute for managing complex databases, and (2) as a platform to
explore data fusion among logically disjoint databases by the U.S. Army
Research Laboratory.
