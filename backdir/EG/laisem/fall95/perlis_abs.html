<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Sources of Inconsistency in Commonsense Reasoning''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>
Although much effort has been expended by researchers in trying 
to maintain a consistent belief base in formalizing commonsense
reasoning, there is some evidence that the nature of commonsense
reasoning itself brings inconsistencies with it. I will outline a
number of sources of such inconsistencies, and discuss why they 
appear unavoidable.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to attend.
