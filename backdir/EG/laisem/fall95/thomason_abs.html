<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Intended Interpretation in Cooperative Discourse''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>
The crucial problem in discourse is how speakers decide what
to leave out of utterances, and how hearers decide what to put into
the interpretation of utterances.  I will argue that the most useful
constraint on this process is that -- at least in relatively simple,
task-related discourse -- what the speaker leaves out but means should
equal what the hearer reconstructs.  To see how this constraint can
be satisfied, we need to simulate the whole discourse process: generation
and interpretation.  I will motivate this approach to discourse and
describe what progress we (a group at SRI and The University of
Pittsburgh) have achieved in pursuing it in a recent project.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to attend.
