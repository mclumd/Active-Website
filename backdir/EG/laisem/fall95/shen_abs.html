<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Disjunctive Logic and Semantics of Disjunctive Databases 
		  and Logic Programs''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>   
In common sense reasoning with incomplete knowledge/data bases, we make
conclusions by default. However, we observe that when the
negation-by-default operator ``not'' is defined as ``not provable'',
the database {a or b, not a, not b} should be consistent because a
being not provable and b being not provable does not imply (a or b)
being not provable. Such an observation is significant for
non-monotonic reasoning, but none of the major current non-monotonic
formalisms are able to support it because they are all based on
classical first-order logic in which (not a) and (not b) implies 
not(a or b). In this paper, we develop a new first-order logic 
(``Disjunctive Logic'') that fully complies with this observation.  
Based on such a
logic we define (disjunctive) databases and (generalized disjunctive)
logic programs and establish intended semantics for them. A new closed
world rule (``Consistent Closed World Assumption'') is introduced that
consistently negates all unprovable ground positive clauses in
databases and all underivable ground positive clauses in logic
programs.  Our non-monotonic theory is able to formalize and solve some
paradoxical problems, such as the lottery paradox and the bird-flying
paradox.
