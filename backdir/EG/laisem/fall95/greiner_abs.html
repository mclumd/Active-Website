<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Learning Good Search Strategies''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
Many tasks, including derivation, diagnosis and planning, require 
searching through a network of probabilistic experiments, seeking 
a satisfying set of successful outcomes.  A "search strategy" specifies
the order in which to perform these experiments; we clearly prefer a 
strategy whose "expected cost" is minimal.  This expected cost depends
on the success probabilities of the experiments, which unfortunately
are usually not known a priori.  This work first describes statistical
methods for estimating these probabilities, and then provides two methods 
that use these estimates to obtain good strategies: One returns a
strategy whose expected cost is, with high probability, approximately
optimal.
As this process is not always tractable, we next present a more general
method
that efficiently hill-climbs to a strategy that is, with high probability,
close to a local optimum.  These techniques directly address the "utility
problem" of explanation-based learning systems.  We also demonstrate their
generality by showing how they can be used to address other (non-search)
tasks, including
 <ul>
 <li> theory revision,
 <li> the "multiple-extension" problem of non-monotonic reasoning, 
 <li> landmark selection for autonomous navigation,  and 
 <li> the "tractability / completeness" problem from knowledge representation.
 </ul>
These results are an application of the ideas of statistics and formal
learning theory to concrete knowledge representation tasks.

<b>Short Biography for Russell Greiner:</b>

<p>
After receiving his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford, Russell
Greiner
worked at the University of Toronto (as a visiting professor) before moving
to Siemens Corporate Research.  He has over 60 publications, in topics 
including 
<ul>
 <li> machine learning
	 <ul>
	 <li> analogical inference
	 <li> explanation-based learning
	 <li> formal PAC-learning
	 <li> theory revision
	 <li> dealing with missing information
	 </ul>
 <li> vision and robot navigation
 <li> knowledge representation
	 <ul>
	 <li> efficient reasoning (optimal derivational strategies,
			caching/memoizing, finding effective abstractions)
	 <li> diagnosis
	 <li> plan verification
	 </ul>
 <li> databases
 <li> operations research
 <li> signal analysis
 <li> systems and control theory. 
</ul>

<p>
The main foci of his current work are applying machine learning techniques 
to address specific knowledge representation tasks, effective theory
revision, understanding "relevance", and robot navigation.
