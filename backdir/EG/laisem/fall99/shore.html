Abstract:            </b>
<p>
Complete axiomatizations and exponential-time decision procedures are
provided for reasoning about knowledge (i.e. statements of the form that
every agent in a group G of agents knows that p and also that every agent
in group G' knows q) and common knowledge (statements that express the
idea that every agent in group G knows p and that every agent in G knows
that every agent in G knows p, etc.) when there are infinitely many
agents.  The results show that reasoning about knowledge and common
knowledge with infinitely many agents is no harder than when there are
finitely many agents, provided that we can check the cardinality of
certain set differences G - G', where G and G' are sets of agents.  Since
our complexity results are independent of the cardinality of the sets G
involved, they represent improvements over the previous results even with
the sets of agents involved are finite. Moreover, our results make clear
the extent to which issues of complexity and completeness depend on how
the sets of agents involved are represented.

The work to be discussed is joint with Joe Halpern (Cornell,  CS).
