<p>
Current models of belief revision such as the AGM model assume logical
closure and consistency in the agent's epistemic states. Besides the
unrealistic nature of these assumptions (which entail intractable
update procedures), the axiomatizations of the revision operations
allow implausible updates such as the trivial update where all of the
agent's old beliefs are discarded upon receipt of a new piece of
information that is inconsistent with the old set. Furthermore,
explicit constructions of the revision process often suffer from
problems with iterated revision. We offer two relevance sensitive,
inconsistency tolerant models for belief revision that attempt to
address these problems. Both of these models employ a syntactic notion
of relevance, based on language overlap between formulas, introduced
in the Language Splitting model [P96].
<p>
The B-structures model [CP99] provides a query answering procedure
that blocks the derivation of arbitrary beliefs from a possibly
inconsistent belief structure, two context-dependent revision schemes,
computational gains and a definition of "refinement" of belief
structures that permits comparisons of belief structures on a
knowledge ordering in a four-valued logic.
<p>
The belief sequences model [CGP99] extends the definition of relevance
used in B-structures, provides a query answering procedure for
inference from a possibly inconsistent sequence of beliefs and pays
explicit attention to the importance of the temporal ordering of
beliefs. Iterated revision is easily handled by this model since it
maintains a revision history.
