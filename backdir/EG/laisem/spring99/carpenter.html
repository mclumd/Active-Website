Abstract:            </b>
<p>
In this talk, I will show how type-logical categorial grammar solves a
number of previously intractable linguistic issues in a novel, elegant
and general way.  I will introduce Lambek's seminal 1958 syntactic
calculus, which provides the logical insights underlying type-logical
grammars.  I will then use core linguistic issues to work up to the
state-of-the-art multimodal type-logical grammars, placing
type-logical grammars in a rich landscape of substructural logics.

Concrete linguistic issues addressed include: quantifier scope,
reciprocation and reflexivization, unbounded dependencies:
relativization and pied piping, 'non-constituent' coordination,
locality and boundednss, islands, coordination of 'unlike categories',
and partially-free word order.  I contend that the type-logical
analyses of these phenomena are the simplest, most comprehensive and
most general available.
