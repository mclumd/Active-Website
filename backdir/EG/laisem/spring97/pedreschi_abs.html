<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Magic set computations in deductive DBs''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
 

In this talk, we introduce a proof method for verifying partial and
total correctness of deductive databases, and apply it
to the study of the ``magic-sets'' transformation. As a result,
a logical reconstruction of efficient bottom-up execution of goal-driven
deduction is accomplished, in the sense that the
correctness of the transformation is obtained by purely declarative
reasoning, abstracting away from procedural semantics.

<b>Brief Resume:</b>

<p>

D. Pedreschi is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the at the
CS Department of the University of Pisa, where he received his Ph.D. in
1987. His main research interests include logic programming and
deductive databases, formal methods for program verification, semantics
and implementation of programming languages, object-oriented databases.
He has been the scientific coordinator of various national, European and
joint EEC-NSF research projects in the area of logic programming and
deductive databases. He is currently the chair of the undergraduate
program in Computer Science at the Univ. of Pisa.
