<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Distributed Artificial Intelligence -- Theory and Applications''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

     Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is a rapidly growing
and relatively new area within Artificial Intelligence. It is usually
divided into two categories of research activity: Distributed Planning
and Problem Solving Systems and Multi-Agent Systems. The former references
systems in which the individual nodes (agents, computers) fully cooperate
whereas the latter category contains systems in which the agents are
heterogeneous (different capabilities, beliefs, goals, values, attitudes,
commitments, etc.) and may compete with each.

<p>

     The talk will provide a theoretical introduction to DAI and describe
briefly six projects completed:

<dd>


. Future Air Traffic Control Systems,

<dd>

. Distributed Control of Nationwide Manufacturing Operations,

<dd>

. Distributed Control of Allocating Moving Resources to Moving Tasks,

<dd>

. Distributed Control of Street and Highway Ramp Traffic Signals,

<dd>

. Coordination and Cooperation in Air War Environments,

<dd>

. Alliances and Norms in Societies of Heterogeneous Interacting Agents.

180 refereed articles and wrote/edited/contributed to 38 books.

<p>


     His current interests include Artificial Intelligence, Simulation of
Cognitive Behavior, Heuristic Programming, Decision Making under Uncert-
ainty and Risk, Theory of Strategies, Computational Linguistics,
Information Retrieval, and Expert Systems.  He was the Director of the
First NATO Advanced Study Institute on Artificial Intelligence and
Heuristic Programming and has lectured at eight NATO Advanced Study
Institutes. During his sabbaticals, he was a Senior Fulbright Scholar
and Visiting Professor at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria
in 1972-73; a Senior Fulbright Scholar and Visiting Professor at the

and Marie Curie, Paris, France, 1995.

<p>


     He has been an ACM Visiting Scientist and Visiting Lecturer, USIA
Lecturer, Member of the IEEE Outstanding Lecturers program.  His awards
include the ACM Recognition of Service Award, Fellow of the British
