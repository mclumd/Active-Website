<b>Abstract:</b><br>
Intelligent dialog systems (IDS) are concerned with the effective
management of an incremental, interactive, user-system interaction (a
dialog).  An IDS must deal with both input and output (interpretation
and presentation) and must monitor the effectiveness of its actions.
To be effective, computer systems must facilitate users' understanding
(for training and education) by incrementally presenting only the most
relevant information, by evaluating users' understanding, and by
adapting the interaction to address communication problems as they
arise.
<br><br>
The general goal of my work is to investigate computational models of
dialog that can support effective interaction between people and
computer systems.  I am doing so by providing a specification and
representation of information that influence how people understand and
respond in an ongoing dialog.  My research also aims to provide
computational methods for integrating and using this information to
produce relevant utterances and to identify and resolve communication
problems as they arise.

This talk will overview some results of our research group's work and
its application to the task of improving health care education.

This is joint work with Susan McRoy, Songsak Channarukul, and Angelo
Restificar.
