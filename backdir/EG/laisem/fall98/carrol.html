<b>Abstract:</b><br>

As computer systems become more sophisticated, they can assist human
beings in performing more complicated tasks.  One such application is
in the development of advice-giving systems in which the computer
system plays the role of a consultant and helps a user develop a plan
to achieve his goal. However, since the computer system and its user
each have private beliefs about the world and about each other, it is
almost inevitable that disagreements will arise between them during
their interaction. In order for the computer system to appear
cooperative, it must be able to detect these disagreements, determine
whether or not they are obstacles to accomplishing the task at hand,
and if so, attempt to resolve these disagreements in order to
successfully complete its task.

In this talk, I will describe a recursive "Propose-Evaluate-Modify"
framework for modeling collaborative dialogues. I will then elaborate
on the "evaluate" and "modify" phases of this process and discuss: 1)
the aspects of a user proposal that a collaborative system must take
into account when evaluating the proposal, and 2) the key issues that
must be addressed when such a system attempts to generate cooperative
responses to resolve a relevant conflict detected in the user
proposal. Finally, I will show some sample responses generated by my
implemented system CORE, and a summary of the cooperativeness and
coherence of CORE's responses judged by human subjects.
