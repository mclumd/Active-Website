<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Logic Programs with Multiple Forms of Default Negation''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
In everyday reasoning, we are accustomed to infer negated information
from positive information.  From a statement like ``the museum opens
from Tuesday to Sunday'' we immediately conclude that the museum is not
open on Mondays.  Logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning have
developed several theories for interpreting negated information and for
deducing it from positive data.  These notions of negation have been
used as separate ways to interpret and to deduce negated information.
That is, each application has chosen one of these notions of negation
and has applied it to every piece of data in the domain of the
application.  However, in everyday reasoning we know that it is not
natural to uniformly use a single rule for negation.  Therefore,
expressive power is undoubtedly gained by allowing the interaction of
different theories for negation in the same application.

<p>
In this talk, a new class of logic programs containing two forms of
default negation in addition to explicit (or ``classical'') negation 
is introduced.  The semantics of these programs is defined and its
properties are investigated.
