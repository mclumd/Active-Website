<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Querying Disjunctive Databases with Nonmonotonic Logics''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
While the problem of retrieving information from relational databases
has been extensively studied for many years, the study of query
languages for disjunctive databases is relatively less established. I
shall talk about recent work -- jointly developed by Thomas Eiter of
the Technical University of Vienna and myself -- that characterizes
the expressive power of various nonmonotonic logics, used as query
languages over disjunctive databases.
Our study shows that different families of nonmonotonic formalisms,
which are perfectly equivalent as far as relational databases are
concerned, are not equivalent at all when disjunctive databases are
considered. Thus, we obtain an objective criterion for preferring
certain semantics rather than others (including semantics for logic
programs).

<p>
We also tackle the classical problem of capturing the set of tractable
queries in the framework of disjunctive databases.  This problem is
relevant also to knowledge representation and automated reasoning, for
it concerns the class of inferences that can be efficiently computed
from any given knowledge-base. Unfortunately, as one could expect, our
results in this case are mostly negative. We prove that none of the
logics commonly considered in logic programming and AI captures the
set of tractable queries, and that the source of difficulty has
nothing to do with those that cause similar problems in the relational
case.
