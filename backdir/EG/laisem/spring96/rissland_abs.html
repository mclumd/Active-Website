<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Cases and Rules: A Natural Synergy''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

In this talk, I'll discuss the use of case-based reasoning (CBR)
in concert with other reasoning paradigms, particularly, rule-based
reasoning (RBR). I'll begin by examining the natural synergy between cases
and rules, especially in situations where the rules and cases involve
open-textured concepts, that is, concepts that cannot be universally defined 
by necessary and sufficient conditions. For such concepts, one typically
resorts to cases. I'll then review the basic mechanisms of case-based
reasoning, such as case indexing and selection. The main part of my talk
will address CABARET, a hybrid CBR-RBR system built in my lab. CABARET
combines RBR and CBR in a dynamic way using an agenda-based control
architecture. The heuristics used to drive the system embody a three-tiered
approach of argument stances, moves, and primitives to the problem of
argument in domains with rules and cases, such as statutory law.
