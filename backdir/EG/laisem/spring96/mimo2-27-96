"Sentences with an Attitude"


ABSTRACT

Necessity, knowledge and related propositional attitudes have 
been analyzed within possible-worlds semantics as modal operators 
on propositions.  Some logicians (Carnap, Quine) and computer 
scientists (McCarthy) have hoped that propositional attitudes can 
be analyzed instead as predicates of sentences.  But a theorem 
proved by Montague in the early sixties, which is closely related 
to Tarski's celebrated demonstration that truth is not definable, 
seems to exclude this possibility.

In fact the prospects for sentences with attitudes are in spite of 
Montague's theorem not all that bad.  Des Rivieres and Levesque 
showed a decade ago that knowledge can be thought of as a 
predicate of sentences provided the sentences are of a rather 
restricted sort.  In particular, they cannot quantify over contents 
of attitudes, as do for example the following sentences:

Jill does not believe anything which Jack says

Jack knows something which Jill doesn't know

In this talk I will present my recent result which extends 
the result of des Rivieres and Levesque to such quantified attitude 
sentences.
