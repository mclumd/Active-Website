<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Sentences with an Attitude''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

Necessity, knowledge and related propositional attitudes have 
been analyzed within possible-worlds semantics as modal operators 
on propositions.  Some logicians (Carnap, Quine) and computer 
scientists (McCarthy) have hoped that propositional attitudes can 
be analyzed instead as predicates of sentences.  But a theorem 
proved by Montague in the early sixties, which is closely related 
to Tarski's celebrated demonstration that truth is not definable, 
seems to exclude this possibility.
<p>
In fact the prospects for sentences with attitudes are in spite of 
Montague's theorem not all that bad.  Des Rivieres and Levesque 
showed a decade ago that knowledge can be thought of as a 
predicate of sentences provided the sentences are of a rather 
restricted sort.  In particular, they cannot quantify over contents 
of attitudes, as do for example the following sentences:
<p>
Jill does not believe anything which Jack says
<p>
Jack knows something which Jill doesn't know
<p>
In this talk I will present my recent result which extends 
the result of des Rivieres and Levesque to such quantified attitude 
sentences.
