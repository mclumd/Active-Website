<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Theories and Logics of Action''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

There has been a recent rebirth of interest in `formal theories of
action' in Artificial Intelligence (and in Philosophical Logic as
well).  Very little of the work in AI actually consists of theorizing
about the nature of action.  Most of it has been devoted to modeling
certain central patterns of defeasible reasoning about actions; much
of it within the Situation Calculus.  The basic Situation Calculus
does presuppose or present a model of actions as state
transformers--in the basic case, functions from states to states.
Slightly generalized, to relations between states, this is the almost
unanimous view of action in Computer Science.  (This view has played
almost no role in Philosophy.)  We present yet another theory of
action, one which suggests a couple of different logics of action.  In
doing so, we waive aside all issues of defeasible reasoning.  We
mention one of these logics, and sketch the second, which is based on
old ideas in Computer Science.  We will also probably digress a lot on
related theories and related logics.
