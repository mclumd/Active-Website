TITLE:   


ABSTRACT:

How can vague utterances be represented?  And how do we update common 
knowledge when we interpret vague utterances?  We will suggest a model 
of the context change required to accommodate vague utterances.  It will 
account for the fact that the extensions of vague adjectives like "smart" and 
"fat" can be stretched to suit the purposes of the participants in a dialogue.
