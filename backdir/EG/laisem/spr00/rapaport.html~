Abstract:            </b>
<p>
This talk will review the progress achieved by the Active Logic Group in designing and
implementing a dialog system controlled by a logical reasoner, the Active
Logic Machine (ALMA).  The overall design of the system will be discussed
as well as issues encountered in trying to engineer a system mixing both
logical inference as well as more traditional programming languages.
