Abstract:            </b>
<p>

I have  developed  an  implementation  to  address  a  natural
language   understanding task  called "Dialogue   Act  Tagging" with a
machine learning method called "Transformation-Based Learning". It was
necessary for me  to 1)  develop a  Monte  Carlo approach to make  the
method tractable  for my task, 2)  adapt a committee method to compute
useful confidence  measures for the  system's tags, and 3) investigate
strategies  for automatically selecting  "dialogue act cues", the most
useful words or phrases for computing dialogue acts in a given domain.
With these  contributions, my implementation  handles the dialogue act
tagging task as effectively as any other reported system.
