Understanding how people speak when they interact with spoken dialogue
systems is critical to improving the performance of those systems.  In
particular, speakers' prosodic behavior provides useful indicators of
a) whether a speaker turn will be recognized correctly or not by an
automatic speech recognition system; b) whether a speaker is reacting
to a system error; and c) whether a speaker is correcting such an
error.  This talk presents results of analyses of human interactions
with the TOOT spoken dialogue system, an experimental system for
accessing train schedules by phone.  Our analytic results show that
there are significant prosodic and lexical differences between
misrecognized and correctly recognized speech and between correction
and non-correction utterances.  Our machine learning results show that
prosodic and other differences can in fact be used to automatically
predict both misrecognitions and their corrections. We suggest how
such results may be used to improve system behavior in dialogue
systems.
