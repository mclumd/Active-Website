Abstract:            </b>
<p>

A growing body of work suggests that action sentences like
'Pat hugged Chris' represent events and certain (grammatically
specifiable) properties of events. Action sentences involving causative
verbs, like 'raised' and 'broke', are especially interesting; they
seem to represent events as having a certain (grammatically
specifiable) structure. For example, 'Chris raised the glass' suggests a
complex event that starts with some action by Chris and ends with a rising
of the glass. Similar temporally-extended events, with various
(gramatically specifiable) subparts, are implicated in serial-verb
constructions of the sort found in languages with sentences like: 
'He will cook food eat', meaning roughly that (i) he will cook the
relevant food and eat that very food, and (ii) the cooking and eating are
part of a single, unified causal process. I'll focus mainly on these
constructions, how they are (un)like English causatives, and how we might 
provide a simple compositional semantics for them. I'll sugges that a
variety of syntactic and semantic considerations converge to suggest that
natural languages are constrained in ways that give rise to what might be
called a "natural mereology" of events; although in my view, the relation
between sentences and causal processes in the mind-independent world
remains quite unclear.
