Presuppositions occur in natural language when something which is not
asserted is assumed to be true based on some other assertion. If someone
asserts:<p> <em>"The king of France is hiding." </em><p> we presuppose that
there is a king of France. 
The speaker did not assert that there exists a king of France but
nonetheless commits himself to the existence of the king of France.
So, that the king of France exists is a presupposition of the utterance.
Presuppositions can arise in many 
<a href="/projects/active/presup/examples.html">
other language constructions </a> as well.

<p>

There are a number of features that distinguish presuppositions from 
assertions:
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/TorF.html">
The T or F criterion.
</a>
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/heritability.html">
Heritability.
</a>
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/assertability.html">
The assertability criterion.
</a>
<p>

Four major approaches to presuppositions have been::
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/logical.html">
Logical Presuppositions.
</a>
<em> (Frege.) </em>
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/expressive.html">
Expressive presuppositions.
</a>
<em> (Strawson.) </em>
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/pragmatic.html">
Pragmatic Presuppositions.
</a>
<em> (Stalnaker.) </em>
<p>
<a href="/projects/active/presup/discourse_context.html">
Pragmatic Presuppositions based on Discourse Semantics.
</a>
<em> (Heim.) </em>
<p>

We think that active logics can contribute to understanding presuppositions.
One of the aspects of presuppositions we are looking at is the problem of
<a href="/projects/active/presup/projection.html"> presupposition projection.
</a>Projection has not had a totally satisfactory account in any of the 
current theories of presuppositions.
<p>
Active Logics have some unique features which can help satisfactorily handle
the problems of projection:
<p>
Reasoning about the history of the logic.
<p>
Robustness in the face of contradictions.
<p>
Belief revisions.
