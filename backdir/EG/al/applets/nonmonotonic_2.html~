<h3>Nonmonotonic reasoning II </h3>

<a href="#Examples">Examples</a>

<hr>

This is an alternative approach to doing nonmonotonic reasoning in
Alma.
<p>
If the premise of a default is in the KB, the conclusion is a
candidate to be added to the KB provided that there is not a more
preferred default the conclusion of which is already in the KB. If
that is the case, the default conclusion is not added.
<p> 
If there is no such more preferred default, the conclusion can be
added to the KB, but we must make sure that there are no less
preferred defaults that hold. If there are, the conclusions of these
defaults and their consequences are distrusted.
<p> 
As a result of this treatment there are no contradictions that
involve defaults which are related through the preference
relation. 
<p>
Recall that the presence of a contradiction causes the following in
Alma: 1. a contra fact is asserted; 2. the contradictands and their
consequences are made unavailable for further inference; 3. distrusted
facts corresponding to these unavailable formulas are added to the
database. Any reinstatement of either contradictand has to be
specified by axioms.
<p>
In this case then, the possible contradictions are 1. between defaults
for which no preference has been stated; 2. between defaults and
non-defeasible formulas; 3. between non-defeasible formulas.
<p>
In the first case, nothing can be done and neither of the
contradictands is reinstated.
<p>
In the second case, we prefer the non-defeasible formulas and
reinstate those.
<p>
The third case is like the second in that no reinstatement is
justified. 
<p>
Some future work:
<p> We assume that the preferences between defaults are known
beforehand. If they are not, we should be able to derive specificity
preferences. This can be done by using backward chaining to prove that
one default is more specific than the other.

<h4> Examples </h4>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="tweety_2_1.html"> Tweety II</a> example is the usual
non-flying bird example. In this case, we are first told that Tweety
is a bird, then that it is a penguin, then that it does fly, then that
it does not. Alma's view of Tweety's flying changes appropirately.

<li> The <a href="nixon_2.html"> nixon diamond</a>
example. Republicans are usually not pacifists, quakers are usually
pacfists, nixon is both quaker and republican. Is he a pacifist?

</ul>
