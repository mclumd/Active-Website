<h3>Time-situated reasoning </h3>


Many active logic applications depend on the time situatedness of the
logic. These examples depend directly on the logic knowing what time
it is as it executes.
<br>
In all of these examples, note that the times (step) at which we want the
actions to happen and the times they actually do are different. This
is because that straightforward way to axiomatize the behavior does
not take into account the delay in doing the inference for the action
to occur. It would be a simple matter to adjust the axioms to do so,
but a more interesting approach would be to get the logic itself to
notice that, for example we request that "lunch" be asserted at step
10, but it only does so at step 11, and modify its behavior
accordingly. 

<ul>
<li> The <a href="simple_alarm_1.html"> simple lunch example </a>. At a
set time (lunchtime), the logic asserts in the database that it is
lunch.

<li> The <a href="settable_alarm.html"> settable lunch example
I</a>. In this case, we can set the time at which we want to go to
lunch. However, this solution has some pecularities that we get around
with:

<li> The <a href="settable_alarm_2.html"> settable lunch example
II</a>. The functionality is the same as above but the axioms
describing the behavior is different.

<li> The <a href="cycle.html">cycle example</a>. Here we want to turn
a device ON and OFF periodically. This is represented by asserting ON
or OFF in the KB as appropriate.

</ul>
