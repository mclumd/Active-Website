<h3>Tweety 1.2 example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
This example illustrates one way to represent and use default
information in active logic. The approach is to treat defaults just as
implications. This results in contradictions if the default should not
have been applied. We resolve contradictions by preferring the more
preferred default. See Tweety 2.* for an alternative approach.

This is a variation on Tweety 1.1. This time we first assert that
Tweety is a penguin before asserting it is a bird.

<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> The domain specification includes the following facts:
<ul>
<li> Penguins are birds.
<li> Penguins don't fly. 
<li> Birds fly.
<li> We prefer penguinsdontfly to birdfly.
<li> Formulas 2 to 5 specify how to resolve contradictions using the
preference above.
</ul>


</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
The metainformation about the derivations of the formulas that is
maintainted by ALma is used in the axioms to determine which
contradictand to prefer. 
<br>
There are situations that are problematic for this simple approach to
defaults.
