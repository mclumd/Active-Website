<h3> Cycle example </h3>
<p>
<h4>Description: </h4>
In this example, we imsgine turning a device on and off at regular
intervals. We might want it to be ON at 10, stay on for 10 steps then
be OFF for 10 steps and repeat that cycle. The start time and period
of the cycling are specified using <pre> cycle(Start, Period).</pre>

<p>
<h4>Run: </h4>
<ul>
<li> At step 3 we add cycle(5, 5).
<li> At step 5, this triggers the inferences so that
<li> Alma prepares to turn OFF at step 10, see <pre> uncycle(10, 5) </pre>
<li> At step 7, ON is asserted and it stays on.
<li> At step 10, Alma start reasoning about turning OFF.
<li> At step 11, this sets up to turn back on at 15
<li> At step 13 ON is deleted and OFF is added.
<li> The cycle then repeats.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
Although we specify that the cycle start at 5 and have period 5, this
is not exactly what happens due to the reasoning time.
