<h3>Mistakes </h3>

We are interested here in having Alma explicitly recognize when it
makes a mistake. This can be a useful capability. If Alma decides to
execute an action or a plan based on some defaults, and later finds
that the default was false at the time it initiated the action, it
should consider that the action is likely to fail. It might decide to
abort the action, or replan for the failure that is likely to occur.
<br>
There are many ways we could define mistakes, we are investigating
that aspect of the problem currently.


<ul>
<li>
In the <a href="mistake1.html">Tweety mistake</a> example, we define
Alma to be mistaken about some formula P at time T if at time T ALma
had enough information to derive P but did not. This can be defined in
Alma and it computes when it was mistaken when there is a
contradiction that is resolved.

</ul>
