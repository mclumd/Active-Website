<h3>Time-situated reasoning </h3>


Many active logic applications depend on the time situatedness of the
logic. These examples depend directly on the logic knowing what time
it is as it executes.

<ul>
<li> The <a href="simple_alarm.html"> simple alarm example </a>. At a
set time, an alarm goes off and WAKE_UP proposition is asserted in the
database. 

<li> The <a href="alarm.html"> settable alarm example</a>. In this
case, we can set the time at which the alarm should go off.

</ul>
