    I worked from 1970 to 2000 as a high school teacher, teaching
a variety of subjects, but mainly chemistry and Great Books seminars
for gifted students; in the Great Books program I also served as
supervisor, coordinator, and budgeter. For several years I also taught
chemistry laboratory classes at Shenandoah College.  My BS is from
Allegheny College; I have a Masters degree (liberal arts/Great Books) 
from St. Johns College (Annapolis).

<p>

I retired in 2000 when my husband and I adopted two children from
Russia.  I am now interested in part-time work at the University of
Maryland. I would welcome work in any of the following areas: lab
technician, grant writing and tending, event (e.g., conference)
organizing, literature search and summarizing, instructor in
elementary lab courses, etc. My salary objective is $20-30 per hour,
or $20,000-30,000 per year.
