Drawing is Approximate</A>
</H1>

<P>
Note that although the drawing plane contains an infinite number of mathematical
points, and drawing can be described as an infinite number of color and opacity
computations, the drawing plane cannot be viewed directly and has no material
existence.  It is only an abstraction.  What can be viewed directly is the
result of rendering portions of the drawing plane onto a medium.  No infinite
computations or objects of infinite size are required to implement CLIM, because
the results of rendering have finite size and finite resolution.

<P>
A drawing plane is described as having infinitely fine spatial, color, and
opacity resolution, and as allowing coordinates of unbounded positive or
negative magnitude.  A viewport into a drawing plane, on the other hand, views
only a finite region (usually rectangular) of the drawing plane.  Furthermore, a
viewport has limited spatial resolution and can only produce a limited number of
colors.  These limitations are imposed by the display hardware on which the
viewport is displayed.  A viewport also has limited opacity resolution,
determined by the finite arithmetic used in the drawing engine (which may be
hardware or software or both).

<P>
Coordinates are real numbers in implementation-defined units.  Often these units
equal the spatial resolution of a viewport, so that a line of thickness 1 is
equivalent to the thinnest visible line.  However, this equivalence is not
required and should not be assumed by application programs.

<P>
A valid CLIM implementation can be quite restrictive in the size and resolution
of its viewports.  For example, the spatial resolution might be only a few dozen
points per inch, the maximum size might be only a few hundred points on a side,
and there could be as few as two displayable colors (usually black and white).
The fully transparent and fully opaque opacity levels must always be supported,
but a valid CLIM implementation might support only a few opacity levels in
between (or possibly even none).  A valid CLIM implementation might implement
color blending and unsaturated colors by stippling, although it is preferred,
when possible, for a viewport to display a uniform color as a uniform color
rather than as a perceptible stipple.

<P>
When CLIM records the output to a sheet, there are no such limitations since
CLIM just remembers the drawing operations that were performed, not the results
of rendering.

<P>
CLIM provides some ways to ask what resolution limits are in effect for a
medium.  See Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#drawing-options">10</A> for their descriptions.

<P>
The application programmer uses the CLIM graphic drawing model as an interface
to describe the intended visual appearance.  An implementation does its best to
approximate that ideal appearance in a viewport, within its limitations of
spatial resolution, color resolution, number of simultaneously displayable
colors, and drawing speed.  This will usually require tradeoffs, for example
between speed and accuracy, and each implementation must make these tradeoffs
according to its own hardware/software environment and user concerns.  For
example, if the actual device supports a limited number of colors, the desired
color may be approximated by techniques such as dithering or stippling.  If the
actual device cannot draw curves exactly, they may be approximated, with or
without anti-aliasing.  If the actual device has limited opacity resolution,
color blending may be approximate.  A viewport might display colors that don't
appear in the drawing plane, both because of color and opacity approximation and
because of anti-aliasing at the edges of drawn shapes.

<P>
It is likely that different implementations will produce somewhat different
visual appearance when running the same application.  If an application requires
more detailed control, it must resort to a lower-level interface, and will
become less portable as a result.  These lower-level interfaces will be
documented on a per-platform basis.

<P>
Drawing computations are always carried out ``in color'', even if the viewport
is only capable of displaying black and white.  In other words, the CLIM drawing
model is always the fully general model, even if an implementation's color
resolution is limited enough that full use of the model is not possible.  Of
course an application that fundamentally depends on color will not work well on
a viewport that cannot display color.  Other applications will degrade
gracefully.

<P>
Whether the implementation uses raster graphics or some other display technique
is invisible at this interface.  CLIM does not specify the existence of pixels
nor the exact details of scan conversion, which will vary from one drawing
engine to the next.

<P>
Performance will also vary between implementations.  This interface is defined
in terms of simple conceptual operations, however an actual implementation may
use caching, specialized object representations, and other optimizations to
avoid materializing storage-intensive or computation-costly intermediate results
and to take advantage of available hardware.
