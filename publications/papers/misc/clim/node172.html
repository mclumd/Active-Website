Output Recording Utilities</A>
</H2>

<P>
CLIM provides several helper macros to control the output recording facility.

<P>
with-output-recording-options (stream <TT> &amp;key </TT>record draw) <TT> &amp;body </TT>body 

<P>
Enables or disables output recording and/or drawing on the <I> output
recording stream</I> designated by <I> stream</I>, within the extent of <I> body</I>.

<P>
The <I> stream</I> argument is not evaluated, and must be a symbol that is bound to
an output recording stream.  If <I> stream</I> is t, *standard-output* is
used. <I> body</I> may have zero or more declarations as its first forms.

<P>
with-output-recording-options must be implemented by expanding into a call
to invoke-with-output-recording-options, supplying a function that executes
<I> body</I> as the <I> function</I> argument to
invoke-with-output-recording-options.  The exact behavior of this macro is
described under invoke-with-output-recording-options.

<P>
invoke-with-output-recording-options stream function record draw

<P>
Enables or disables output recording and/or drawing on the <I> output
recording stream</I> <I> stream</I>, and calls the function <I> function</I> with the
new output recording options in effect.  <I> function</I> is a function of one
argument, the stream; it has dynamic extent.

<P>
If <I> draw</I> is <I> false</I>, output to the stream is not drawn on the
viewport, but recording proceeds according to <I> record</I>; if <I> draw</I> is
<I> true</I>, the output is drawn.  If <I> record</I> is nil, output recording
is disabled, but output otherwise proceeds according to <I> draw</I>; if
<I> draw</I> is <I> true</I>, output recording is enabled.

<P>
All output recording streams must implement a method for
invoke-with-output-recording-options.

<P>
with-new-output-record (stream <TT> &amp;optional </TT>record-type record
                                     <TT> &amp;rest </TT>init-args)
                                    <TT> &amp;body </TT>body

<P>
Creates a new output record of type <I> record-type</I> (which defaults to
standard-sequence-output-record) and then captures the output of <I> body</I>
into the new output record, and inserts the new record into the current ``open''
output record associated with the <I> output recording stream</I> designated by
<I> stream</I>.  While <I> body</I> is being evaluated, the current output record
for <I> stream</I> will be bound to the new output record.

<P>
If <I> record</I> is supplied, it is the name of a variable that will be lexically
bound to the new output record inside of body.  <I> init-args</I> are CLOS
initialization arguments that are passed to make-instance when the new output
record is created.

<P>
with-new-output-record returns the output record it creates. 

<P>
The <I> stream</I> argument is not evaluated, and must be a symbol that is bound to
an output recording stream.  If <I> stream</I> is t, *standard-output* is
used.  <I> body</I> may have zero or more declarations as its first forms.

<P>
with-new-output-record must be implemented by expanding into a call to
invoke-with-new-output-record supplying a function that executes <I> body</I>
as the <I> function</I> argument to invoke-with-new-output-record.  The exact
behavior of this macro is described under invoke-with-new-output-record.

<P>
invoke-with-new-output-record stream function record-type
                                             <TT> &amp;rest </TT>init-args <TT> &amp;key </TT>

<P>
Creates a new output record of type <I> record-type</I>.  The function
<I> function</I> is then called, and any output it does to the <I> output
recording stream</I> <I> stream</I> is captured in the new output record.  The new
record is then inserted into the current ``open'' output record associated with
<I> stream</I> (or the top-level output record if there is no currently ``open''
one).  While <I> function</I> is being executed, the current output record for
<I> stream</I> will be bound to the new output record.

<P>
 
<I> function</I> is a function of two arguments, the stream and the output record;
it has dynamic extent.  <I> init-args</I> are CLOS initialization arguments that
are passed to make-instance when the new output record is created.

<P>
invoke-with-new-output-record returns the output record it creates.

<P>
All output recording streams must implement a method for
invoke-with-new-output-record.

<P>
with-output-to-output-record (stream <TT> &amp;optional </TT>record-type record
                                           <TT> &amp;rest </TT>init-args))
                                          <TT> &amp;body </TT>body

<P>
This is identical to with-new-output-record except that the new output record
is not inserted into the output record hierarchy, and the text cursor position
of <I> stream</I> is initially bound to 31#31.

<P>
 
<I> record-type</I> is the type of output record to create, which defaults to
standard-sequence-output-record.  <I> init-args</I> are CLOS initialization
arguments that are passed to make-instance when the new output record is
created.

<P>
If <I> record</I> is supplied, it is a variable that will be bound to the new
output record while body is evaluated.

<P>
with-output-to-output-record returns the output record it creates.

<P>
The <I> stream</I> argument is not evaluated, and must be a symbol that is bound to
an output recording stream.  If <I> stream</I> is t, *standard-output* is
used.  Unlike facilities such as with-output-to-string, <I> stream</I> must be
an actual stream, but no output will be done to it.  <I> body</I> may have zero or
more declarations as its first forms.

<P>
with-output-to-output-record must be implemented by expanding into a call
to invoke-with-output-to-output-record supplying a function that executes
<I> body</I> as the <I> function</I> argument to
invoke-with-output-to-output-record.  The exact behavior of this macro is
described under invoke-with-output-to-output-record.

<P>
invoke-with-output-to-output-record stream function record-type 
                                                   <TT> &amp;rest </TT>init-args <TT> &amp;key </TT>

<P>
This is similar to invoke-with-new-output-record except that the new output
record is not inserted into the output record hierarchy, and the text cursor
position of <I> stream</I> is initially bound to 31#31.  That is, when
invoke-with-output-to-output-record is used, no drawing on the stream
occurs and nothing is put into the stream's normal output history.  The function
<I> function</I> is called, and any output it does to <I> stream</I> is captured in
the output record.

<P>
 
<I> function</I> is a function of two arguments, the stream and the output record;
it has dynamic extent.  <I> record-type</I> is the type of output record to
create.  <I> init-args</I> are CLOS initialization arguments that are passed to
make-instance when the new output record is created.

<P>
invoke-with-output-to-output-record returns the output record it creates.

<P>
All output recording streams must implement a method for
invoke-with-output-to-output-record.

<P>
make-design-from-output-record record

<P>
Makes a design that replays the <I> output record</I> <I> record</I> when drawn.
If <I> record</I> is changed after the design is made, the consequences are
unspecified.  Applying a coordinate transformation to the design changes the
transformation used when replaying the output record.

<P>
It is permissible for implementations to support this only for those output
records that correspond to the geometric object classes (for example, the output
records created by draw-line* and draw-ellipse*).
