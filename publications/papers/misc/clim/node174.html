Overview of Table Formatting Facilities</A>
</H1>

<P>
In general, table formatting involves a sharing of responsibilities between
user-written code and CLIM code.  Code that employs only the lower level output
facilities has full control over ``where every piece of ink goes'' in the
output.  In contrast, code that employs CLIM's table formatting facilities
passes control to CLIM at a higher level.  The programmer benefits by being able
to specify the appearance of output in more compact abstract terms, and by not
having to write the code that constrains the output to appear in proper tabular
form.

<P>
Tabular output consists of a rectangular array of pieces of output corresponding
to the bounding rectangles of the output.  Each piece of output forms the
contents of a <I> table cell</I><A NAME="19560"></A>.  There is no restriction on the contents of
a table cell; cells may contain text, graphics, even other tables.  For purposes
of this discussion, we draw a strong distinction between specifying what goes in
a cell, and specifying how the cells are arranged to form a table.

<P>
Specifying the contents of a cell is the responsibility of the programmer.  A
programmer using the table formatting facilities can predict the appearance of
any individual cell by simply looking at the code for that cell.  A cell's
appearance does not depend upon where in the table it lies, for instance.  The
only thing about a cell's appearance that cannot be predicted from that cell
alone is the amount of space the table formatting has to introduce in order to
perform the desired alignment.

<P>
Specifying the relative arrangements of cells to form a table is the
responsibility of CLIM based on the advice of the programmer.  The programmer
advises CLIM about extra space to put between rows or columns, for instance, but
does not directly control the absolute positioning of a cell's contents.

<P>
For purposes of understanding table formatting, the following model may
be used. 

<UL>
<LI>The code for a cell draws to a stream that has a ``private''  (local to
that cell) drawing plane.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>After output for a cell has finished, the bounding rectangle of all output
on the ``private'' drawing plane is found.  The region within that bounding
rectangle forms the contents of a cell.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Additional rectangular regions, containing only background ink, are
attached to the edges of the cell contents.  These regions ensure that the
cells satisfy the tabular constraints that within a row all cells have the same
height, and within a column all cells have the same width.  CLIM may also
introduce additional background for other purposes as described below.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>The cells are assembled into rows and columns.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The advice that the programmer gives to CLIM on how to assemble the table
consists of the following:

<UL>
<LI>How to place the contents of the cell within the cell (such as centered
vertically, flush-left, and so forth)  The possibilities for this advice are
described below.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Optionally, how much additional space to insert between columns and
between rows of the table.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Optionally, whether to make all columns the same size.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The advice describing how to place the contents of the cell within the cell
consists of two pieces--how to constrain the cell contents in the horizontal
direction, and how to constrain them in the vertical direction.
