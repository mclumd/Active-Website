Overview of CLIM
</H1>

<P>
The Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) is a powerful Lisp-based user interface
programming interface that provides a layered set of portable facilities.  These
include basic windowing, input, and output services provided by Silica (which is
a portable layer for constructing windows and toolkit objects); stream-oriented
input and output extended with facilities such as output recording,
presentations, and context sensitive input; and a compositional toolkit similar
to those found in the X world that supports look and feel independence.

<P>
CLIM provides an API (applications programmer interface) to user interface
facilities for the Lisp application programmer.  CLIM does not compete with the
window system or toolkits of the host machine (such as X/Motif or
NEWS/OpenLook), but rather uses their services (to the extent that it makes
sense) to integrate Lisp applications into the host's window environment.  For
example, CLIM ``windows'' are mapped onto one or more host windows, and input
and output operations performed on the CLIM window are ultimately carried out by
the host window system.  CLIM will support a large number of host environments
including Genera, X/Motif, X/OpenLook, the Macintosh, CLOE-386/486, and the Next
machine.

<P>
The CLIM programmer is insulated from the complexities of portability, since the
Lisp-based application need only deal with CLIM objects and functions regardless
of their operating platform (that is, the combination of Lisp system, host
computer, and host window environment).  CLIM abstracts out many of the concepts
common to all window environments.  The programmer is encouraged to think in
terms of these abstractions, rather than in the specific capabilities of a
particular host system.  For example, using CLIM, the application can specify
the appearance of output in high-level terms and those high-level descriptions
are turned into the appropriate appearance for the given host.  Thus, the
application has the same fundamental interface across multiple environments,
although the details will differ from system to system.

<P>
Another important goal in the design and organization of CLIM is to provide a
spectrum of user interface building options, all the way from detailed,
low-level specification of ``what goes where'', to high-level user interface
specification where the programmer leaves all of the details up to CLIM.  This
allows CLIM to balance the ease of use on one hand, and versatility on the
other.  The idea is that by using high level facilities, a programmer can build
portable user interfaces quickly, whereas by recombining lower level facilities
he can build his own programming and user interfaces according to his specific
needs or requirements.  For example, CLIM supports the development of
applications independent of look and feel (also dubbed ``chameleon look and
feel'') as well as the portable development of toolkit libraries that define and
implement a particular look and feel.

<P>
In addition, CLIM's modular design allows application programs to exclude
facilities that they do not use, and reimplement any or all of the substrate.
To these ends, CLIM is specified and implemented in a layered, modular fashion.
Each facility documented in this specification has several layers of interface,
and each facility is independently specified and has a documented external
interface.

<P>
The facilities provided by CLIM include:

<P>
 
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Geometry</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides provides geometric objects like point,
rectangle, and transformations and functions for manipulating them.
<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Graphics</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a rich set of drawing functions,
including ones for drawing complex geometric shapes, a wide variety of drawing
options (such as line thickness), a sophisticated inking model, and color.
CLIM provides full affine transforms, so that a drawing may be arbitrarily
translated, rotated, and scaled (to the extent that the underlying window
system supports the rendering of such objects).

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Windowing</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a portable layer for implementing <I> sheet</I>
classes (types of window-like objects) that are suited to support particular
high level facilities or interfaces.  The Silica module of CLIM defines a
uniform interface for creating and managing hierarchies of these objects
regardless of their sheet class.  In addition, Silica defines standard sheet
classes that define a straightforward window that is more or less equivalent in
functionality to an X window.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Output Recording</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a facility for capturing all output
done to a window.  This facility provides the support for arbitrarily scrollable
windows.  In addition, this facility serves as the root for a variety of
interesting high-level tools.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Formatted Output</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a set of high-level macros that
enable programs to produce neatly formatted tabular and graphical displays with
little or no effort.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Context Sensitive Input</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The <I> presentation type</I> facility of CLIM
provides the ability to associate semantics with output, such that objects may
be retrieved later via clicks on their displayed representation.  This
<I> sensitivity</I> comes along automatically and is integrated with the Common
Lisp type system.  A mechanism for type coercion is also included, providing the
basis for powerful user interfaces.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Application Building</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a set of tools for organizing
an application's top-level user interface and command processing loops centered
on objects called frames.  CLIM provides functionality for laying out frames
under arbitrary constraints, managing command menus and/or menu bars, and
linking user interface gestures with application commands.  Using these tools,
application writers can easily and quickly construct user interfaces that can
grow flexibly from prototype to delivery.

<P>
 </DD>
<DT><STRONG>Adaptive Toolkit</STRONG></DT>
<DD>CLIM provides a uniform interface to the standard
compositional toolkits available in many environments.  CLIM defines abstract
panes that are analogous to the gadgets or widgets of a toolkit like InterViews
or the X toolkit.  CLIM fosters look and feel independence by specifying the
interface of these abstract panes in terms of their function and not in terms of
the details of their appearance or operation.  If an application uses these
interfaces, its user interface will adapt to use whatever toolkit is available
in the host environment.  By using this facility, application programmers can
easily construct applications that will automatically conform to a variety of
user interface standards.  In addition, a portable lisp-based implementation of
the abstract panes is provided.

<P>
CLIM provides an architecture for building and incorporating panes that can be
used by application users.  This includes a mechanism for selecting
implementations of abstract panes based on the frame manager that controls the
frame.   (It's look and feel is to be determined, but probably the right answer
is Motif-like).

<P>
CLIM applications can be written without building in knowledge of particular
frame managers.  They can later be tailored by the user and/or by the
application developer for a particular frame manager.  The CLIM interface
provide facilities that allow developing applications that are good citizens
under various existing and emerging desktop manager.

<P>
 
[Wires and Triggers]  <I> to be defined, but roughly...</I> Wires
provide a mechanism for hooking elements of the user interface to the
applications functionality.

<P>
 
[Settings]  <I> to be defined, but roughly...</I> Settings are a
mechanism for merging the look and feel preferences and defaults of users,
frames, and frame managers.
