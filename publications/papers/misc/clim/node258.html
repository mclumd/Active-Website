Finding Frame Managers</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most frames need only deal directly with frame managers to the extent that they
need to find a frame manager into which they can insert themselves.  Since
frames will usually be invoked by some user action that is handled by some frame
manager, finding an appropriate frame manager is usually straightforward.

<P>
Some frames will support the embedding of other frames within themselves.  Such
frames would not only use frames but also act as frame managers, so that other
frames could insert frames.  In this case, the embedded frames are mostly
unaware that they are nested within other frames, but only know that they are
controlled by a particular frame manager.  Writing frames that support embedding
is described more in the section on Frame Manager Protocols.

<P>
The find-frame-manager function provides a flexible means for locating an
frame manager to adopt an application's frames into.  There are a variety of
ways that the user or the application can influence where an application's frame
is adopted.

<P>
An application can establish an application default frame manager using
with-frame-manager.  A frame's top-level loop automatically establishes the
frame's frame manager.

<P>
The programmer or user can influence what frame manager is found by setting
*default-frame-manager* or *default-server-path*.

<P>
Each frame manager is associated with one specific port.  However, a single port
may have multiple frame managers managing various frames associated with the
port.

<P>
find-frame-manager <TT> &amp;key </TT>where

<P>
Finds an appropriate frame manager that conforms to the values of a number of
parameters including the <I> where</I> argument, special dynamic contexts
established by the application or CLIM on the application's behalf, and global
variables established by the programmer or user.

<P>
The value of the <I> where</I> option can be a port or a server path or nil,
which is its default.  This value is used to screen candidate frame managers to
ensure that they are associated with the correct port.  A frame manager is found
using the following rules in the order listed:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If a current frame manager has been established via an invocation of
with-frame-manager, as is the case within a frame's top-level, and that
frame manager conforms to <I> where</I>, it is returned.  Any frame managers
conforms if <I> where</I> is nil.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>If *default-frame-manager* is bound to a currently active frame
manager and it conforms to <I> where</I>, it is returned.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>If <I> where</I> is a port, then a frame manager that conforms to the
default look and feel of the port is found or constructed and returned.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>If <I> where</I> is a server path, then a port is found for that server, and
then a frame manager that conforms the default look and feel of the port is
found or constructed and returned.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>If <I> where</I> is nil, a port is found and an appropriate
frame manager is constructed using *default-server-path*.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
 
*default-frame-manager*

<P>
This variable provides a convenient point for allowing a programmer or user to
override what frame manager type would normally be selected.  Most users will
not set this variable since they can set *default-server-path* to indicate
which host window system they want to use and are willing to use whatever frame
manager is the default for the particular port.  However, some users may want to
use a frame manager that isn't the typical frame manager.  For example, a user
may want to use both an Open Look frame manager and a Motif frame manager on a
single port.

<P>
with-frame-manager (frame-manager) <TT> &amp;body </TT>body

<P>
Generates a dynamic context that causes all calls to find-frame-manager to
return <I> frame-manager</I> if the <I> where</I> argument passed to it conforms to
<I> frame-manager</I>.  Nested calls to with-frame-manager will shadow outer
contexts.  <I> body</I> may have zero or more declarations as its first forms.
