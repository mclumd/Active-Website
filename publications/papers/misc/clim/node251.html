Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
 
<I> Application frames</I><A NAME="34746"></A> (or simply, <I> frames</I><A NAME="34748"></A>) are the central
abstraction defined by CLIM for presenting an application's user interface.
Many of the other features and facilities provided by CLIM (for example, the
generic command loop, gadgets, look and feel independence) can be conveniently
accessed through the frame facility.  Frames can be displayed as either
top-level windows or regions embedded within the space of the user interfaces of
other applications.  In addition to controlling the screen real estate managed
by an application, a frame keeps track of the Lisp state variables that contain
the state of the application.

<P>
The contents of frame is established by defining a hierarchy of <I> panes</I><A NAME="34750"></A>.
CLIM panes are interactive objects that are analogous to the gadgets or widgets
of other toolkits.  Applications builders can compose their application's user
interface from a library of standard panes or by defining and using their own
pane types.  Application frame can use a number of different types of panes
including <I> layout panes</I><A NAME="34752"></A> for spatially organizing panes, <I> user
panes</I><A NAME="34754"></A> for presenting application specific information, and <I> abstract
gadget panes</I><A NAME="34756"></A> for displaying data and obtaining user input.  Panes are describe
in greater detail in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node262.html#panes">29</A>.

<P>
Frames are managed by special applications called <I> frame managers</I><A NAME="34758"></A>.
Frame managers control the realization of the look and feel of a frame.  The
frame manager interprets the specification of the application frame in the
context of the available window system facilities, taking into account
preferences expressed by the user.  In addition, the frame manager takes care of
attaching the pane hierarchy of an application frame to an appropriate place in
a window hierarchy.  The most common type of frame manager is one that allows
the user to manipulate the frames of other applications.  This type of
application is typically called a desktop manager, or in X Windows terminology,
a window manager.  In many cases, the window manager will be a non-lisp
application.  In these cases, the frame manager will act as a mediator between
the lisp application and the host desktop manager.

<P>
Some applications may act as frame managers that allow the frames of other
applications to be displayed with their own frames.  For example, a text editor
might allow figures generated by a graphic editor to be edited in place by
managing the graphics editor's frame within its own frame.

<P>
Application frames provide support for a standard interaction processing loop,
like the Lisp ``read-eval-print'' loop, called a <I> command loop</I><A NAME="34760"></A>.  The
application programmer has to write only the code that implements the
frame-specific commands and output display functions.  A key aspect of the
command loop is the separation of the specification of the frame's commands from
the specification of the end-user interaction style.

<P>
The standard interaction loop consists of reading an input ``sentence'' (the
command and all of its operands), executing the command, and updating the
displayed information as appropriate.  CLIM implementations are free to run the
display update part of the loop at a lower priority than command execution, for
example, some implementations may choose not to update the display if there is
typed-ahead input.  Also, command execution and display will not occur
simultaneously, so user-defined functions need not have to cope with
multiprocessing.

<P>
To write an application that uses the standard interaction loop provided by
CLIM, an application programmer does the following:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Defines the presentation types that are specific to the application.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Defines the application frame's commands, specifying the presentation
types of the operands involved in each command.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Defines the set of frames needed to support the application.

<P>
 </LI>
<LI>Defines the output display functions associated with the frames (possibly
using other facilities such as the incremental redisplay).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Taking as an example a simple ECAD program, the programmer would first define
the appropriate presentation types, such as wires, input and output signals,
gates, resistors, and so forth.  He would then define the program's commands in
terms of these types.  For example, the ``Connect'' command might take two
operands, one of type ``component'' and the other of type ``wire''.  The
programmer may wish to specify the interaction style for invoking each command,
for example, direct manipulation via translators, or selection of commands from
menus.  After defining an application frame that includes a CLIM stream pane,
the programmer then writes the frame-specific display routine that displays the
circuit layout.  Now the application is ready to go.  The end-user selects a
command (via a menu or command-line, or whatever), the top-level loop takes care
of collecting the operands for that command (again, via a variety of user
gestures), and then the application invokes the command.  The command may have a
side-effect on the frame's ``database'' of information, which can in turn affect
the output displayed by the redisplay phase.

<P>
Note that this definition of the standard interaction loop does not constrain
the interaction style to be a command-line interface.  The input sentence may be
entered via single keystrokes, pointer input, menu selection, or by typing full
command lines.
