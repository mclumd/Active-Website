In [<A HREF="node24.html#gurneyperlispurangheim">Gurney, Perlis, &amp;
  Purang1995</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#purangperlisgurneyactive">Purang, Perlis, &amp;
  Gurney1996</A>], the
authors consider active logics applied to the failures of
presuppositions and of implicatures. Since presuppositions and
implicatures are defeasible beliefs, once an agent acquires some such beliefs,
these may have to be rejected later on when new information is
available. Active logic is used to effect this belief change.  The
common theme of this work is the need for tracking over time the
set of beliefs an agent has as it participates in a dialog.

Figure <A HREF="node10.html#presup">4</A> illustrates a case of failed presuppositions. 
We imagine an agent listening in on the conversation.  T1
leads the agent to presuppose each presupposes that there are roses and
that there is a fridge. At T3 John states that there are no
roses. This contradicts the presupposition that there are roses, and
the presuppositional belief should be rejected. However the belief
that there is a fridge (also presuppositional, and also introduced in
T1) should be retained.  However, in the standard discourse updating
theory [<A HREF="node24.html#heimprojection">Heim1983</A>], at the end of T3, the presupposition
that there is a fridge would not be present.  Using an active logic to
process the discourse a step at a time, and to handle contradictions,
gives the correct results.

<STRONG>Figure 5:</STRONG> The implicature triggered at T2 is absent after T3<BR>
<P>
<P>
Figure <A HREF="node10.html#implic">5</A> illustrates implicatures being made and later
withdrawn.  At T2, Kathy infers the implicature that the roses are
fresh, since Bill says that they are in the fridge. However, at T3
she needs to retract this belief when Bill states that the
roses are not fresh after all. The active logic used enables
contradictory beliefs to be held (e.g., that the roses are fresh and
that they are not fresh) temporarily, which serves as a trigger for
subsequent repair (e.g., settling on one of the two).
<P>
This illustrates some forms of miscommunication and approaches to
studying them. Meta-reasoning and meta-linguistic abilities are major
features in the solution of these problems.
