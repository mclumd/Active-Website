In [<A HREF="node24.html#clarkawareness">Clark1978</A>] Clark surveys the literature and presents
empirical evidence for the use of meta-linguistic skills by young
children. She organizes that into a taxonomy of meta-cognitive skills
that children exhibit starting from the age of 2. We reproduce part of
that below together with some examples of these behaviors, most of which
are from her paper.
<P>
<OL><LI>
<EM>Monitoring one's ongoing utterance</EM>
<P>
This includes spontaneous repair of speech which was noticed in a girl
aged 1 year and 7  months.  Children also practice parts of speech on
their own as this child practicing its pronunciation at 2 years and 6  months:
<BLOCKQUOTE> Back please / berries / <EM>not</EM> barries / barries, barries / <EM>not</EM>
barries / berries / ba ba.
</BLOCKQUOTE><LI>
<EM>Checking the result of an utterance</EM>
<P>
This includes commenting on and correcting the utterances of
others. This has been observed in children aged 5 years and 4
months. Children also check if the listener has understood their
utterances and repair if needed.<LI>
<EM>Testing for reality</EM>
<P>
This is concerned with testing if a word works and substituting it if it does 
not.<LI>
<EM>Deliberately trying to learn</EM>
<P>
By, for example, practicing new sounds as seen above. Also, role-playing
children adjust their language depending on their role: father, mother,
doctor and so on. This has been observed in four-year old children. Another
example is the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE> Mommy, is it AN A-dult or A NUH-dult?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
from a four-year old.<LI>
<EM>Predicting the consequences of using inflections, words, phrases or
sentences</EM>
<P>
This includes judging the politeness of utterances, which is exhibited by
children aged four and a half. Children can also correct word order in 
sentences judged ``silly''. Clark cites instances of this being done by
two-year olds.<LI>
<EM>Reflecting on the product of an utterance</EM>
<P>
An example is riddles and rhymes which are made by six year old children.
Children also identify linguistic units like syllables as illustrated
in [<A HREF="node24.html#slobincase">Slobin1978</A>] for his daughter aged 3 years and 1 month. Another example is providing
definitions which Slobin's daughter started when aged 4 years and 7 months.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
Slobin [<A HREF="node24.html#slobincase">Slobin1978</A>] discusses the use of meta-linguistic terms 
like <EM>mean, be called, name, word</EM> and so on, by his daughter from
the age of 3 years and 4 months.
<P>
We see a rich variety of meta-linguistic behaviors exhibited by very
young children which seems to help their conversing with others and
learning the language. Therefore it seems that meta-linguistic skills
are already present in children who are just beginning to learn a
language. This is an important piece of evidence for our proposal (see
Section <A HREF="node14.html#secconvad">4.3</A>).
