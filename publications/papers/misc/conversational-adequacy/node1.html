In [<A HREF="node24.html#mcroydiss">McRoy1993</A>] McRoy urges that the ability to deal with
mistakes is central to communication, and moreover that it is best
treated as part and parcel of the same reasoning and linguistic
abilities as the rest of the communication process, rather than as a
separate and optional refinement. We agree. In fact, much of the
research in active logics
[<A HREF="node24.html#millerdiss">Miller1993</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#gurneyperlispurangheim">Gurney, Perlis, &amp;
  Purang1995</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#purangperlisgurneyactive">Purang, Perlis, &amp;
  Gurney1996</A>]
is based on a very similar point of view, not only toward
communication but toward situated reasoning in general.  This is also
related to the grounding problem [<A HREF="node24.html#traumdiss">Traum1994</A>] and the
misidentification problem
[<A HREF="node24.html#millerdiss">Miller1993</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#maidamaintaining">Maida1991</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#maidapropositionally">Maida1992</A>]
<P>
Here we will explore the thesis that meta-dialog and meta-reasoning
are, in some sense, both necessary and sufficient for communication.
Just as the common-sense world has proven to be sufficiently complex to
require that any intelligent common-sense agent be able to carry on
appropriate meta-reasoning with respect to uncertainty, incomplete
data, error and inconsistency, conversation too is fraught with
complex and frequent surprises requiring the same degree of
common-sense reasoning. Mistakes are inevitable in dialog; indeed,
there can be no such thing as error-free dialog even in principle, let
alone in practice: language itself has too many ambiguities for
that. In practice, conversation tends to quickly break down in the
absence of facility to recognize and repair errors, ask
clarificational questions, give confirmation, and perform
disambiguation. (Military commands and air traffic control to the
contrary: these are highly reduced lingoes. Yet even there we find
negotiation over meaning.)  We describe empirical tests of these and
other hypotheses in a special section later in the paper.  The closest
thing to real error-free speech  may in fact be a speech itself, where the
audience listens silently and probably misunderstands a great
deal. Yet even there the speaker often resorts to speech repairs.
<P>
Moreover, sufficient facility with meta-reasoning can overcome large
deficiencies in other skills, whether the task is problem-solving or
conversation. Rieger [<A HREF="node24.html#riegerdiss">Rieger1974</A>] makes a similar point; here we
are concerned to apply this idea to the problem of miscommunication in
particular, with attention as well to the Turing Test.
