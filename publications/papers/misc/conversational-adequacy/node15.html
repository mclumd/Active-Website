<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">Extreme examples of conversational adequacy</A></H1>
<P>
Each of the following examples appears to be a case of an individual <EM>not</EM>
understanding a conversation well, but nevertheless--by utilizing 
meta-linguistic and meta-cognitive skills--being able to
make some headway and, in a very real sense, being a conversational
participant.  These are speculative; that is, we are not certain they
appropriately support our claim, but we think that there is much to be
gained from airing them alongside it.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Apprentice:</STRONG>
<DD> An apprentice conversing with an expert or
listening in on a conversation between experts will encounter several
problems: many of the terms used might be unfamiliar; some terms may
be familiar but used with apparently different meanings; some of the
inferences made by the expert might not be known to the apprentice.
<P>
In this case, the apprentice has is deficient in part of the language
capacity (his lexicon items does not include items pertaining to the
expert conversation) and a deficiency in his world knowledge. The rest
of the capacities of the apprentice we assume adequate, however.
<P>
If the apprentice has sufficient meta-communication capabilities, he
will be able to notice that there are terms he does not understand,
and inferences that are not clear to him. He can then ask for
clarification from the experts thereby participating in the
conversation. In this way, he can gain a better understanding of the
conversation and of the underlying topics. Note that without the basic
ability to notice his confusion, the apprentice will be lost and will
not be able to participate in the conversation.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Foreigner:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
A foreigner with only a rudimentary knowledge in a new language is in
a more difficult situation than the apprentice because the foreigner
does not have all (for normal users of this language)the grammatical
competence for the new language, neither will he have all of the
socio-linguistic knowledge. Even then, we think conversation is possible 
through the miscommunication competence. The foreigner can negotiate
the meanings of new words and grammatical constructions and get an
understanding of his interlocutors meaning (and get his meaning across).
An example of that (where the foreigner's meaning does not get 
across but where there is this negotiation) is in Figure <A HREF="node6.html#savignon">1</A>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Child:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
A child is in an even more difficult situation than the foreigner. The
child is presumably in the process of acquiring all its competences,
so none of them will be available in the adult form. We cannot assume
that the child will have the complete miscommunication competence,
neither will he have all the inference competence. Yet, the child can
converse from an early age (as parents will attest) and does make
progress in acquiring the language. As seen in the related work on
meta-linguistics (Section <A HREF="node5.html#metalinguistics">3.2</A>), children do make use of
large amounts of meta-linguistic behaviors to converse and to learn
the language, and a key part of this is the recognition by the
child that it does not understand, that it mis-pronounces, and so on.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>SLI:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
Specific Language Impairment occurs in children who have severe
problems in comprehension and/or expression of language but who have
normal hearing, and have no mental or emotional problems
[<A HREF="node24.html#bentondevelopmental">Benton1964</A>]. However, children who do have SLI show a
variety of deficiencies that suggest that SLI is more meaningfully
broken up in sub-classifications [<A HREF="node24.html#starktallalselection">Stark &amp;
  Tallal1981</A>]. However, no
sub-classification has been widely accepted. There is no accepted
neurological cause for SLI either.
<P>
A child with SLI is at a disadvantage as compared to a normal child,
so this case is even more difficult than the previous one. However,
these children still communicate, apparently using meta-linguistic
skills. Children with SLI were found to ask for clarifications from
adult interlocutors in non-verbal ways more frequently than normal
children [<A HREF="node24.html#galeliebergottgriffingetting">Gale, Liebergott, &amp;
  Griffin1981</A>]. This seems to suggest
that these children still use meta-linguistic strategies in
communication, but since they have problems with speech, they do it
non-verbally. However, it has also been found that they overall
request for less clarifications than normal children
[<A HREF="node24.html#donahuepearlbryanlearning">Donahue, Pearl, &amp;
  Bryan1981</A>]. So they might also be deficient
in miscommunication competence. It has been also found
[<A HREF="node24.html#pinkerlanguage">Pinker1994</A>] that these children resort to various
strategies to achieve communication, such as repetition, memory,
seeking help from others, and heavy use of conscious analysis of
utterances.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Our point in these examples is not that excellence in parsing and
other aspects of language are unimportant frills, but that there is an
almost pre-linguistic core of capabilities, essential to any effective
communication, even very slow and inefficient communication. In a
sense, this is definitional of adequacy.  For instance, below we
consider current Turing Test agents to be ineffective, because they
apparently cannot, no matter how much time they are allowed, come to
deal with their interlocutor's concerns.
