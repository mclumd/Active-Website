There is such a thing as talking past one another, where I talk
for a bit, then you talk for a bit, with only very slight attention
to the details of what the other is saying. This talking-past, or
running-on, is typical of Turing Test efforts as seen above; programs are assessed
with respect to how well they can chatter on in rough correspondence
to a topic, with appropriate defusers such as ``I don't know'' or
``huh?'' when the syntax gets too tough. But there is little or no
communication, in the sense of success at dealing with the specific
points being made by the other speaker. In particular, clarification
questions such as ``Are we talking about the same person?'' are generally
not dealt with at all. In general, meaning is not dealt with at all,
and in particular not situated meaning (e.g., reference to the dialog
itself). Some programs are quite cleverly designed to appear to be engaging
in ``real'' dialog, i.e., engaged in discussion of a topic in concert
with their interlocutor; but no amount of effort to get them to deal
with meaning succeeds, and this reveals that they are in effect
babbling words meaningless to them.
<P>
Here we give an example of the sort of ``real'' discussion that
reveals attention to meaning (and hence to errors: error after
all is a mismatch between what is meant or intended and what
was produced, i.e., the meaning produced is not the meaning
desired).
<P>
We imagine a ``bare'' human: stripped of all personal and episodic
memory and even perhaps of much vocabulary, but with rationality and
error-dealing capacity intact, as well as some bare-bones language.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> How old are you?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> I don't know what ``old'' means.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> ``Old'' refers to the number of years you have been alive.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> I don't know what ``years'' and ``alive'' mean.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> OK. Let's start with time. Do you know about time?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> ``About time'' means ``almost too late''.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> You misunderstand me. I mean, do you know what ``time'' means?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> Yes: time is the measure that keeps increasing second by second.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Good. Now, how much time has passed since you were born?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> What is ``born''?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Let's back up. A minute is 60 seconds; an hour is 60 minutes;
a day is 24 hours; and a year is 365 days.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> OK.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> So, how many years have you been here, or anywhere?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> I can't calculate that; I don't know where to count from.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Do you remember ever not being here?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> No.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> How long have we been talking?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> 22 seconds; now 23; now 24...
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Stop! That's enough.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> What is enough?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> What do you mean?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> You said ``that's enough.'' What does ``that'' refer to?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Oh, ``that's enough'' is just an expression, meaning ``stop''.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> OK. So you repeated yourself: you said ``stop'' and then said
``that's enough'' as well.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Hmm, you are right. I guess there is more meaning to ``that's
enough'' than simply ``stop'' but I can't explain it easily.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> OK.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> What is your name?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> I don't know.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> Let's call you ``AL''.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL:</STRONG>
<DD> OK, my name will be ``AL''.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>you:</STRONG>
<DD> So, AL, what is the earliest memory you have?
<P>
<DT><STRONG>AL</STRONG>
<DD>: Hmm, I think it is when we began talking, about a
minute ago.
<P>

<P>
Although AL and the interlocutor have not gotten very far, and have
not answered the opening question, nevertheless each utterance in the
sequence does by and large bear on what has gone before, especially
when either party calls the others' attention to that.  In addition,
the two agents have made some significant progress in reaching some
common ground and in particular in referring to the course of the
conversation itself.
<P>
This dialog illustrates at least four of our five miscommunication
competence abilities.  AL's reasoning is situated in time and he can
refer to temporal entities.  He also keeps a record of his beliefs
over time.  AL can distinguish between words and their meanings,
enabling him to inquire about words he doesn't understand.  AL's
deictic reference to present and past times enables him to readily
refer to his own and others' utterances.  AL may even detect
contradiction when he notes the human agent's redundant use of the
command to ``stop''.
<P>
The above conversation is not a human/computer dialog. However, it
should be!  There seems to be a no-man's land between academic NLP and
Loebner Prize NLP.  Each extreme seems far removed from ``genuine''
conversation of the sort we are urging here. We think that substantial
effort devoted to algorithmic treatments of conversational adequacy may
help bridge the gap between theoretically informed single-sentence
research and totally unbridled (as well as unprincipled) Turing Test
programs.
