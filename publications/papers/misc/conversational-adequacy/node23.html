<P>
Humans have an utterly amazing ability, yet one that is so familiar
to us that we take it for granted: we can engage in free-ranging
conversation, on any topic whatsoever, including ones that we have
no prior knowledge of. While this may correctly remind one of the seemingly
foolish behavior of chatting on and on about things one knows
nothing about, it also has deeper significance, in its implied
ability to recognize a topic (or expression or concept) as new to
oneself and to adopt the attitude of learning by listening and by
appropriate questioning as well as venturing tentative opinions.
<P>
This ability is not one that, to our knowledge, has been given much
scholarly attention. However, we suspect it is quite fundamental
to human dialog and perhaps more generally to human reasoning and even to
whatever one might wish to call intelligence.
<P>
It is important to note that deliberate interactive learning features
prominently in this ability. In general, learning has been studied
separately from natural language (other than language learning) or
from reasoning (but see [<A HREF="node24.html#velosointegrating"></A>] for one prominent
exception). We think this is a mistake, and that learning and language
and reasoning are part and parcel of one underlying core set of
abilities.
<P>
We also think that this free-rangingness, which we have also referred to as
full conversational adequacy, is largely what separates most existing
computer dialog systems from human discourse.
<P>
We do not believe that our preliminary list of principles for
conversational adequacy is, in itself, adequate! We are sure that
further essential principles can be added, without which effective
communication cannot occur. But we think that a complete list may be
possible, and that, like a universal Turing machine, a certain degree
of capability opens the door to the rest (modulo efficiency). Since we
are not working within the stricture of a precise definition of
effective communication, proofs are not possible; but for the same
reason proofs of the Church-Turing Thesis are not possible. Instead we
can hope for suggestive evidence, such as in the form of computer
programs with more or less conversational ability, and in the form of
human examples such as we have presented.
<P>
Our suggested conversational
adequacy principles are largely ones of cognitive ability, not
specific to conversation. We think this is appropriate: much of the
reasoning that underlies effective communication, and especially
effective dealing with miscommunication, is general-purpose reasoning.
For this reason, Turing was appealing to a good hunch in focusing on
conversation as a measure of thought. While thought of course can
occur without conversation, it is less plausible that (effective)
conversation can occur without thought; this is most salient in the
conversational patterns associated with (repair of) miscommunication.
