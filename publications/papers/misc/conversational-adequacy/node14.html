Our main thesis about conversational adequacy can now be stated as follows: 
<DL ><DT><STRONG><i>(i)  SUFFICIENCY:</i></STRONG>
<DD>
<i> as long as there is at least a <EM>weak</EM> ability 
     in the ``object'' capacities (inference, learning and language) then
     effective conversation can proceed if there is a <EM>strong</EM>
     miscommunication competence.</i>
<P>
<DT><STRONG><i>(ii) NECESSITY:</i></STRONG>
<DD> 
<i>no matter how strong the object capacities, effective
     conversation cannot proceed if there is not a strong miscommunication competence.</i>
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
We suppose an agent to have at least a <EM>weak</EM> ability in the three
object capacities; what is critical is that these be sufficient to
support the fourth capacity: miscommunication competence.<A NAME="tex2html11" HREF="footnode.html#156"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> Thus the agent may be
rather poor at parsing, for example, but must be able to parse such
meta-sentences as ``what does X mean?''  and ``can you repeat that?''
and ``didn't you say X?''. Notice that the use of quoted or reified
text, as well as deictic reference to text, are special abilities not
always well-treated by parsers.  The agent must furthermore be able to
reason appropriately on the basis of such parses.  It is helpful to
think of the agent as translating parsed sentences into an internal
logical language on which its inference engine can run; and among its
inferential tasks is the assessment of the parse as plausible or not:
if not, then a miscommunication is presumed and a repair effort is
initiated.
<P>
We cannot prove our thesis because we have no precise definition of
conversational adequacy. However, we can operationalize the concept,
along lines suggested by the Turing Test; in the next several sections
we present evidence which supports the thesis.
