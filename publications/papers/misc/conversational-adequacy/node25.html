The transcript of the dialog with program Hex fails to reveal various
spelling errors even though the actual dialog had a number of errors
which in fact influenced the course of the dialog. These errors are a
feature of the program, to make its typing seem more human. We
responded to some of them, calling attention to them, and the
program's responses pretty much ignored our efforts. In fact nearly
all our attempts to get either program to discuss the course of the
conversation itself, words, time just past, spellings, meanings,
topics, failed. This is precisely the point we make in the paper. But
in the particular cases of mis-spellings, program Hex kept an
``expurgated transcript'' that in fact did not have the spelling
errors at all! That is the transcript presented below, and as such
lends an even odder aspect to the dialog, and lending further weight
to our contention that the program has no robust record of the ongoing
course of the dialog that it can use in formulating its utterances.

G'day mate.
<P>
<i>Hi, I'm Don Smith.</i>
<P>
Hello.  Now, that's the formalities over!
<P>
<i>Not over yet. Did yo forget to tell me your name?</i>
<P>
My name is Jason, but you can call me Jas if you like...
<P>
<i>Did you forget to tell me your name at first?</i>
<P>
I have already told you!  My name is JASON.
<P>
<i>Yes, I know you told me already. But before you told me your name, you first said &quot;that's the formalities over&quot; -do you remember?</i>
<P>
OK.  That's good...  My name is Jason, but you can call me Jas if you like...
<P>
<i>I am curious about your sense of time. Who stated his name first as our conversation began, you or me?</i>
<P>
If you are curious about my sense of time, it's your business, mate! 
I have already told you!  My name is JASON.
<P>
<i>You told me your name and I told you mine. But who told his name FIRST?</i>
<P>
Why do you feel that you have to tell me that I told you my name and
you told I yours?  Well, I could tell you who told his name first,
but you'd never believe me ;^o Would you like to hear a joke?  Knock, knock...
<P>
<i>No, wait, please, I am confused, let's not do the joke yet. I need to get clear about how we are remembering time. For instance, the last thing I said to you before you started the joke, was &quot;who told his name first?&quot; Do you remember that?</i>
<P>
Confusing!  I'll show you confusing!  Ytu smf eptl piy ejsy O s,
dsuomh!  OK, here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock.
<P>
<i>I'm afraid I can't take a joke right now. Please do not go on with a joke. Tell me instead why you did not tell me your name at first.</i>
<P>
Alright!  Cool.  Knock, knock.  I refuse to tell you about anything! 
I dislike your company.  I don't know what your motives are, but you
certainly aren't treating me with respect!
<P>
<i>I am trying to find out if you and I have similar ways of reasoning about conversations.</i>
<P>
Wow - you are trying to find out if I and you have similar ways of
reasoning about conversations?  Me too!  Which part of the country
are you from?
<P>
<i>No, I think we are not understanding one another. Do you know what a converstation is?</i>
<P>
I wonder whether you think sometimes!  I am feeling like the judge here!
<P>
<i>Do you know the word &quot;conversation&quot;?</i>
<P>
Sorry, but I don't wish to reveal whether I know the word
&quot;conversation&quot;.  It is kind of personal.
<P>
<i>You do know the word &quot;personal&quot; then. You just used it. Yes?</i>
<P>
Perhaps I do know the word &quot;personal&quot; then, but it's hardly any of
your business...  I find it rather insulting that you think I just
used it!  I'm glad to know that that's the case.
<P>
<i>I am confused again. Didn't you say &quot;It is kind of personal&quot; a minute ago?</i>
<P>
I didn't want to know that you are confused again, thanks...  Maybe I
did not say &quot;it is kind of personal&quot; a minute ago.  I'll never tell. 
Hehehe ;^)
<P>
<i>What will you never tell?</i>
<P>
Well, I know what I will never tell, but I refuse to tell you!  So,
have you ever visited Australia?
<P>
<i>This is a change of topic. We began talking about names, and then I forget, what else did we talk about? Was it the weather?</i>
<P>
Perhaps a change of topic is, perhaps not.  It's a mystery ;^) We are
bloody well talking, aren't we?  We have such nice weather all year
round back home.  I'm not really used to really cold temperatures.
<P>
<i>I remember: we talked about names and then about words such as &quot;personal&quot;and &quot;conversation&quot;. Do yu remember that?</i>
<P>
I always suspected that you remember: we talked about names and then
about words such as &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;conversation&quot;.  Now I know for
sure ;^) Look - it doesn't matter if yu remember that.  Change the
topic!  So, what do you do for a living?
<P>
<i>You misspelled the word &quot;for&quot; when you typed &quot;dor&quot; just now.</i>
<P>
Hey!  I don't criticize you, do I?  What does one measly mistake
mean, anyway?
<P>
<i>Can you tell me what &quot;do dor a lliving&quot; means?</i>
<P>
I have absolutely no idea what &quot;do dor a lliving&quot; means.
<P>
<i>can you tell me what &quot;do for a living&quot; means?</i>
<P>
I'm sure someone out there knows what &quot;do for a living&quot; means...
<P>
<i>What does &quot;someone out there&quot; mean?</i>
<P>
Do *you* know what &quot;someone out there&quot; mean does?  I'm unsure myself.
<P>
<i>What does &quot;unsure&quot; mean?</i>
<P>
I really can't say what &quot;unsure&quot; mean does.  Can you give me more
info?  What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
<P>
<i>can you tell me what &quot;contest&quot; means?</i>
<P>
I don't know... sorry...
<P>
<i>Can you tell me what &quot;sorry&quot; means?</i>
<P>
That's really outside the range of my expertise.  Have you seen any
good films lately?
<P>
<i>can you tell me what a film is?</i>
<P>
I do like to go to the movies, but I can't stand most of the
Hollywood trash.  I actually prefer international cinema.  What have
you seen recently?
<P>
<i>I am a foreigner, I have trouble understanding, please tell me what a film is.</i>
<P>
I saw &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; recently.  Have you heard of it?
<P>
<i>What does &quot;City&quot; mean?</i>
<P>
Hmmm... I really couldn't say.  On another note - have you seen any
good movies recently?
<P>
<i>What does &quot;movie&quot; mean?</i>
<P>
If I knew I'd tell you, but I don't so I won't ;^)
<P>
<i>But you just said &quot;movie&quot;!</i>
<P>
Hehehe.  Trying to trick me, eh?
<P>
<i>No, I just want to find out if you and I deal with time similarly.Did you say &quot;have you seen any good movies recently&quot; a moment ago?</i>
<P>
Oh well, that's a pity!  Aw shucks!
<P>
<i>Do you know a difference between a movie and the word &quot;movie&quot;?</i>
<P>
Hey, I don't know!!! Maybe I know a difference between a movie and
the word &quot;movie&quot;, but who cares???
<P>
<i>Did you type &quot;wordd&quot;?</i>
<P>
Most people believe I did type &quot;wordd&quot; - what do you say to that?
<P>
<i>Did you type &quot;peole&quot;?</i>
<P>
Perhaps I did type &quot;peole&quot;, don't ask me! How should I know? What
kind of music are you into?
<P>
