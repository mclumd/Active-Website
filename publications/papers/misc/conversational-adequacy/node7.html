McRoy and Hirst [<A HREF="node24.html#mcroydiss">McRoy1993</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#mcroyhirstrepair">Hirst &amp; McRoy1995</A>] consider
misunderstanding and repairs in dialog. In their model of
conversation, misunderstanding is signaled by an inconsistency
between the expectations of a dialog participant and an utterance.
The agent must then reason about and explain this
inconsistency. This can lead to a change in the interpretation of
previous parts of the dialog and trigger a repair utterance.
McRoy discusses Figure <A HREF="node7.html#mcroy">2</A> where T3 is inconsistent with
the expectations of Russ and is repaired in T4.

<P>
The language of the model includes terms representing quoted
propositions believed or uttered by agents.  The model also includes
terms for situating linguistic intentions, actions, and beliefs in
time.  These constructs, coupled with the model's prioritized
default-reasoning methods, enable agents to reason about the discourse
itself, including others' utterances and beliefs and their sequencing.
The agent can consider various interpretations of what is said, as
well as detect and repair her own or others' misunderstandings.  One
advantage of such a model is that detection and repair is not
distinguished from the processing of normal speech.
<P>
Unfortunately, the model does not include facilities for
distinguishing between terms and their meanings.  Thus, Mother has no
way to say ``By saying `Do you know  ', I meant I wanted to know.''  The model also lacks any systematic way for agents to
refer to time itself: Mother cannot say ``You misunderstood what I
just said.''  To represent a large range of error-correction
scenarios, the model must express meta-reference, reference to
linguistic elements themselves.
