<P>
``Conversation'' can mean different things to different people.
Although it is difficult to give any authoritative definition, for our
purposes conversation can be roughly characterized as an extended
sequence of utterances between two agents.  Conversations typically
involve information transfer in both directions, with agents taking
turns speaking.
<P>
We claim that conversations are interesting (and useful) linguistic
entities for four principal reasons.  First, they are among the
principal ways humans interact and acquire information, and therefore
are central to human behavior.  Second, because conversations are
extended through time, they inevitably involve errors as well as allow
for their correction.  This extended quality also enables a
conversation to reference itself in meaningful ways: the participants
can talk about what they said earlier in the conversation.  Third,
conversations typically involve each agent requesting specific
information and the other agent addressing and fulfilling that request
as best he can.  In other words, in ``successful'' conversations agents do
not ``talk past'' one another, ignoring the other agent's concerns and
inquiries.  Finally, conversations can be ``free-ranging'', in the
sense that they may concern any arbitrary topic.  Taken together,
these four properties allow a strong claim to be made about agents
that can successfully participate in conversation.  Such agents are
very close to being capable of communicating intelligently about
anything and everything.
<P>
Of course, no human or machine agent knows everything, so when we
claim a conversationally adequate agent can converse about some
obscure topic, her participation might be limited to asking questions
and learning.  However, the ability to recognize and address one's
ignorance or confusion is crucial to any conversation, even one
concerning topics one is familiar with.  Whether the problem stems
from an error or from ignorance, an agent possessing suitable
meta-reasoning can recognize and converse about its confusion and the
underlying problem, and thereby overcome it.
<P>
For our purposes, then, a rough definition of (full) conversational
adequacy is that the agent can usefully engage in free-ranging
conversation, successfully exchanging information with another agent
over the course of a conversation covering any arbitrary topic.  We
argue  that the ability to use meta-reasoning
(coupled with other crucial skills like learning) to correct errors is
an ability that, once sufficiently sophisticated, allows agents to
engage in free-ranging conversation.  We do stress, however, that
conversational adequacy ultimately is a matter of degree.  In some
cocktail party chatter, for instance, agents may talk past each other
to a varying degree depending on their motivation.  Agents may also
vary in the degree to which they are free-ranging: the early Eliza the
Doctor program could occasionally pull off a conversation about a
topic it had no knowledge of, but certainly could not match a human
being in this respect.
<P>
Since our definition is still somewhat imprecise, we also explore the
possibility of operational definitions of full conversational
adequacy.  Our examination of programs which currently fail the Turing
Test will illustrate both the free-ranging character of conversation
and the importance of meta-reasoning in understanding it.  This
examination also suggests an operational definition for conversational
adequacy similar to the Turing Test.
