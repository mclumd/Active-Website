<P>
One possible test of the importance of miscommunication competence could involve
 a typed conversation in which there is no backspacing, no repair of
any sort, no back reference to what was said: one is required to go on
and let errors lie in peace.  If miscommunication competence is fundamental to
communication, the conversation should be somehow impaired.  We hypothesize
that under such restrictions one does not get very far before
communication breaks down.  Even with very accurate typing, there will
be errors of thought, things one later decides one did not mean, etc.
Without some potential correction, agents' individual threads of
meaning cannot be interwoven.
<P>
To perform such an experiment, one could employ a third party as a filter
between the two agents. The filter would be trained to reject any messages 
that involved meta-dialog. There would have to be a judgment on the 
success or breakdown of communication. This could be an intuitive decision
by a panel of humans, for instance. Whether this could be standardized is
an empirical question.
