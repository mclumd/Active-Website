Miller [<A HREF="node24.html#millerdiss">Miller1993</A>] discusses reasoned change in belief and
terminological change in the context of active logic. An agent has to
be able to change the meaning of a term and later reason about the
old and the new meanings. Figure <A HREF="node9.html#miller">3</A> illustrates this.

<STRONG>Figure 3:</STRONG> The meaning of ``John'' changes from John Smith to John Jones<BR>
<P>
<P>
There change in belief occurs in 4 steps:
<P>
<OL><LI>
<P>
<EM>The agent acquires a set of beliefs.</EM> This occurs in turns T1 to
T3.  The beliefs include not only those explicitly stated in the
dialogue, but also beliefs about who John is, some beliefs about the
consequences of breaking a leg and so on. In particular, Agent 2
believes ``John'' to refer to John Smith who Agent 2 knows to be a
bachelor.<LI>
<P>
<EM>The agent notices a problem in the set of beliefs.</EM>At T3, there
is a presupposition that John is married. This causes a contradiction
with the previously acquired belief that John is a bachelor. This
contradiction is detected by the active logic.<LI>
<P>
<EM>The agent finds out what beliefs are causing the problem and what
is wrong about them.</EM>  Since it is faced with a contradiction, the
agent tries to reason about which of the beliefs was mistaken: either
it is wrong to presuppose that John is married or the initial belief
of Agent 2 that John was unmarried was wrong. In this case, Agent 2
tries to resolve this by challenging the statement of Agent 1 in T4.
At this point, Agent 2 should also suspend its beliefs about the
marital status of ``John''.<LI>
<P>
<EM>The agent uses information gathered in the previous step to restore
coherence.</EM> If the agent knows one of the beliefs is mistaken, it can
then reinstate the other. At T5, Agent 1 informs Agent 2 of the reason
for the inconsistency: the meaning Agent 2 attached to ``John'' was not
correct. So, Agent 2 has to change this meaning and now John is part of
the common ground of the conversation.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
This illustrates the change in meaning of ``John'' from John Smith to
John Jones, and the change in the belief that the ``John'' being
talked about being unmarried. This ability to change the meaning
of a term is an essential aspect of any competent conversationalist.
