Active logic [<A HREF="node24.html#elgotdrapkinperlisreasoningjetai">Elgot-Drapkin &amp;
  Perlis1990</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#millerperlispresentations">Miller &amp;
  Perlis1993</A>]
is a family of formalisms developed for the
purpose of modeling the reasoning process in a way that respects the
passage of time as reasoning proceeds.  These formalisms have been
applied to a number of domains, from multi-agent interaction to
deadline-coupled planning, from fully-decidable default reasoning to
reasoning in the presence of contradictions, from correcting
misidentification errors to meaning change.
<P>
Rather than proceeding from one nonmonotonic theory (with one set of
axioms) to another nonmonotonic theory (with an updated set of axioms)
there is one discretely evolving theory in active logic.  This models
a process of thinking that takes a reasoner from one belief state to
the next.  The sequence of belief states the reasoner experiences is
recorded into a history. That history, together with a quotation
mechanism, enables the logic to reason about its own reasoning in
time.
<P>
The belief state transitions are effected by a set of rules which map
the history up to time <I>t</I> onto a new state at <I>t</I> + 1. The
inheritance rule, for instance, will, by default, cause all the
beliefs held at time <I>t</I> to be also held at time <I>t</I> + 1 (we say these
beliefs are inherited). One of the situations where this rule is
defeated is the presence of direct contradictions at time <I>t</I>: if both
<I>p</I> and <I>not</I>(<I>p</I>) are beliefs at <I>t</I>, then neither is inherited to <I>t</I> +
1.  This in effect removes the contradiction from the <I>t</I> + 1 belief
state and prevents it from directly affecting future states.  Such a
contradiction will also trigger the belief <I>contra</I>(<I>p</I>, <I>not</I>(<I>p</I>)) at <I>t</I> +
1 to indicate that a contradiction occurred.  The logic can then
reason about the contradictands and take appropriate actions including
reinstating the belief judged correct (if any).
<P>
The features of active logic that make it especially useful for the
study of conversational adequacy are its handling of time, its
recording of its history and its detection of contradictions. 
These features made it appropriate for modeling terminological change, 
presuppositions and implicature failure as discussed below.
