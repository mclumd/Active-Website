Hex was the winner of the 1996 Loebner Prize competition.
The source code of the program is available at http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch.
This program again illustrates the same failings as the Mystery
program above, but is more tantalizing because it has a much more
convincing fluidity, and more careful probing is required to reveal
the underlying lack of conversational adequacy. We struggled repeatedly
and in various formats and phrasings to get the program to refer to its
own past utterances or indeed to our utterances, with no success. Nor was
it able to refer to words, as opposed to their referents. Thus no repairs,
nor even recognition of miscommunication was possible. The transcript of
the dialog is in the appendix.
<P>
We have similar examples using various other recent Loebner Prize competitors,
and we are confident that conversational inadequacy as we have described
it earlier in this paper is not present even in rudimentary form in any
of these programs.
