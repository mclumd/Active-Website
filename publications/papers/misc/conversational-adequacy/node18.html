In [<A HREF="node24.html#hayesfordturing">Hayes &amp; Ford1995</A>] Hayes and Ford take Turing
[<A HREF="node24.html#turingcomputing">Turing1950</A>] to task for his formulation of what has come
to be known as the Turing Test, arguing in particular that it has
harmful effects on the long-term development of artificial
intelligence.  They suggest that the Turing Test might be better
viewed as a test of ``human conversational competence''.
<P>
We agree with this intuition, especially in light of our analysis of
 the sophisticated programs currently failing the Turing Test.
 Turing's formulation is a clever finesse of the tough problem of
 characterizing intelligence: it attempts a reduction to an
 operational definition.  As such it does not do much toward solving
 that problem. However, we think that the test points toward a
 useful operationalization of conversational adequacy.  In our
 variant, the automated agent would be judged not on whether it is human,
 but on its ability to engage
 in free-ranging discussion, including meta-discussion, as an
 apprentice if it knows little or nothing about it, and learning as it
 goes.  The agent would be required to talk about the conversation
 itself, any miscommunications that arise, and even about grammatical
 constructions such as word order, spelling, and meaning.
<P>
How can such a judgment of free-ranging ability be made? We suggest 
that, like the judgment of being human, this can be made in a 
reliably consistent way by trained judges. Section  <A HREF="node22.html#sectoward">8</A>
gives an example conversation of the sort we have in mind.
