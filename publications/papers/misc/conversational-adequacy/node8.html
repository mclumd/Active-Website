Traum [<A HREF="node24.html#traumdiss">Traum1994</A>] observes that most approaches to natural
language understanding assume that utterances are heard and understood
correctly by the dialog participants. However, an appreciable portion
of dialog is involved in coordinating understanding between the
participants. This accounts for half the utterances in the TRAINS
domain [<A HREF="node24.html#allenschuberttrains">Allen &amp;
  Schubert1991</A>].<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#86"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> These utterances are not about
the domain of the conversation, but about the conversation itself, and
are used for acknowledgment, acceptance, clarification and repair. 
An example from the TRAINS system
[<A HREF="node24.html#heemanallendetecting">Heeman &amp;
  Allen1994</A>] is:
<P>
<EM>and pick up um the en- I guess the entire um p- pick up the load of
oranges at Corning</EM>
<P>
Traum discusses a finite state model for grounding (grounding is the
process by which participants in a dialogue reach mutual understanding
of what was intended by the speaker) which uses a set of grounding
acts including acknowledgment and repairs.  In the model, agents
continually work towards a shared understanding of both the content of
each other's utterances as well as the linguistic intentions of those
utterances.  In so doing, agents rely on shared, conventional meanings
of acts such as acknowledgments.
<P>
These grounding acts are incorporated into a theory of action in
conversation which is them used in a theory of dialog management
implemented in the TRAINS system.  Throughout the theory of
conversation acts, the focus is on effectively communicating not just
the content of the conversation, but also each agent's perception of
the current state of the conversation itself.  The theory must
therefore refer (usually implicitly) to prior beliefs and utterances
of agents, as well as to time-situated states of the dialog.  One
interesting question raised by Traum's use of a finite state model is
whether such a model can adequately capture communication referencing
prior communication, which could be arbitrarily recursive.
