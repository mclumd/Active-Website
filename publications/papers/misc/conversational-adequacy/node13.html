<P>
It is clear from the previous section that an agent that is to
converse adequately needs to be able to detect and repair a number of
different types of failures in conversation. The question we address
is that given the base competences described above, whether there is any
additional competences 
that would enable an agent to detect and repair all those types of errors.
If there is such an competence, it would be crucial that any agent that
hopes to converse adequately to have it.
<P>
From the examples of the previous section, we note that some of the
abilities required are the ability to detect and resolve
contradictions, to reason about the beliefs of conversational
participants and to change the meaning of terms. We think that all
these skills, which all have to do with reasoning about beliefs or
about the linguistic objects in the conversation, can be accounted
for by a general meta-reasoning and meta-linguistic ability. We call
this ability miscommunication capability. Note that this is a
particular characterization of the abilities of the agent. This will
be satisfied as long as the agent is observed to act in ways
consistent with this characterization, whatever the internal
organization of the agent may be.  But if it looks like an agent
cannot exhibit all of this ability, it will not be considered to have
shown full miscommunication capability and there will be cases of
miscommunication that it cannot handle in a ``reasonable'' fashion.
<P>
We now give more details of what this meta-reasoning and meta-linguistic
ability is. Miscommunication ability includes the ability to represent and
reason about the following:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>1. Time:</STRONG>
<DD> A high degree of <EM>situated</EM> temporal reasoning
provides tremendous gains in representational and inferential
capacity, and in particular in the capacity to deal with error,
contradiction, and miscommunication.  This appears to result in part
from the ability to refer back in time to what has been said (or
thought) and thereby to examine its meaning and correctness. We
emphasize that it is <EM>situated</EM> temporal reasoning that is the
issue. The mere ability to reason <EM>about</EM> time, while crucial, is not
sufficient. There has to be the ability to reason <EM>in</EM> time.  We
have evidence for that from a series of studies of common-sense
reasoning, including some aspects of dialog, that we have conducted.
<P>
This item is fundamental, perhaps the most fundamental
of all, underlying even the use/mention distinction and appearance/reality
distinction (see [<A HREF="node24.html#millerdiss">Miller1993</A>]). Simply noticing, let alone repairing,
an error of miscommunication, requires seeing it as a reified entity
rather than as one's current view of the world. The agent must come to
see it as part of its <EM>previous</EM> view of the world; this in turn requires
a robust situated temporal-reasoning facility, in which the present
moment is constantly being moved into the past as a new moment becomes
the present. All of the miscommunication examples presented above show
the need for this.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>2. History:</STRONG>
<DD> Time-representation permits there to be a history
of the discourse so far, that is constantly developing during the
conversation. Since agents can disagree on the history, it must be
possible to revise the history, but in such a way that the fact of the
revision as having taken place is also stored, along with the revised
and un-revised versions. Together with a history of the dialogue, the
agent needs to have a history of its beliefs as they change. It needs
to know what it previously believed to notice that that might have
been false and to repair the consequences of that belief. This is
clearly present in Figure <A HREF="node7.html#mcroy">2</A> where Russ has to keep track of
the previous utterances in the discourse and of his beliefs, including
his expectations which he later found to be inaccurate. Had he not
remembered what his expectations had been, there would have been no
repair.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>3. Meaning:</STRONG>
<DD> Words have meanings, and the meanings are different
from the words.  Therefore it is necessary to represent and reason
about meanings separately from the terms used to represent these
meanings. It is possible to hear a word, and therefore know it has
been uttered, without knowing what it means.  Figure <A HREF="node6.html#savignon">1</A>
illustrates this. The waitress hears something but cannot recognize
what it is and initiates a repair. Moreover, meaning is plastic, at
least partially under the control of speakers, who may be asked what
meaning they have in mind. A key facility in meta-discourse is the
ability to refer to a word, separately from its meaning; quotation is
one device that can be used, but tone and other devices are also
available. This is illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node9.html#miller">3</A> where the
miscommunication could not have been righted without the ability of
the agent to assign a different meaning to the term ``John''.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>4. Contradiction:</STRONG>
<DD>
<P>
The examples in the section on related work can be viewed as involving
contradictions in understanding between the two speakers. Indeed,
three of the examples are explicitly analyzed by their authors in such
terms.  We consider the discovery of a direct contradiction to be one
of the chief ways for detecting miscommunication. Of course, the
presence of a contradiction spells problems for a reasoning agent, and
we are arguing here that a conversational agent must very much be a
reasoner too. See [<A HREF="node24.html#millerdiss">Miller1993</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#rooslogic">Roos1992</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#perlissources">Perlis1996</A>] for
more discussion of the problem of reasoning with inconsistent
information.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>5. Linguistic objects:</STRONG>
<DD> The agent needs to have the ability to
reason about words, sentences and other parts of language about some
of the processes that manipulate language, and about the past course
of the ongoing discussion. The waitress in Figure <A HREF="node6.html#savignon">1</A> must
reason about the sound she heard which she believes to be a part of
language, not a noise. This is also seen in the example in the TRAINS
system. An agent cannot correct either its own or a conversational
partner's utterance if it cannot reason about the utterance itself.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Time allows for the possibility of reasoning about conversational
history; and for the possibility of reasoning in the face of
contradictions. The latter are important as cues that miscommunication
has occurred: recognition of miscommunication is the first step in
the meta-reasoning that can lead to repair. The next step is often
communication of the fact of miscommunication, to enlist the help
of the other agent in the repair;<A NAME="tex2html10" HREF="footnode.html#143"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> at times however this is unnecessary,
if the recognizer can effect the repair alone. In any event, reification
of (typically) recent portions of the ongoing conversation is an
essential step in the meta-reasoning of recognition and repair. There
must be something seen as needing repair, and that something is linguistic
rather than ``in the world'': utterances are taken as things in themselves,
not identified with their presumed meanings, as long as they are under
inspection with respect to a miscommunication. Thus the recent past is
turned into an object. This can often recurse, as the present becomes
reified into the past as well; see the McRoy example above, where
each agent initiates a repair (Mother at T3 and Russ at T4)--in this
case, each agent does the repair alone, but the presumed reasoning
involves internal reifications of what has just been said. A similar
example could be given in which Mother and Russ talk out loud as they
do their repairs:
<P>
<PRE><TT> 
T3
<P>
Mother: 		 You say ``Who?''? That doesn't answer my
<P>
		         question. You misunderstood me. I want to
<P>
		         know who myself, and hope you can tell me.
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
This idea of miscommunication capability, though it covers much the
same behaviors as strategic competence does, is of a different
nature. Our notion refers to the computational abilities an agent has
to exhibit to be able to deal with miscommunication, not the
strategies themselves. To account for those, the agent also needs to
have the knowledge of what actions to take in various circumstances of
miscommunication but to decide what actions to take, miscommunication
capability is essential.
