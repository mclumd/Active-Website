<P>
We first consider the basic competences we think an agent needs for 
conversations without considering the possibility of errors.
<P>
These competences are:
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Grammatical competence</STRONG>
<DD>
This is just Chomsky's linguistic competence, the same as Canale and Swain's
grammatical competence (see above).
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Object inference</STRONG>
<DD>
The ability to infer new beliefs from old ones pervades all of cognition,
including conversations. In Figure <A HREF="node10.html#implic">5</A> for example, Kathy has
to infer that the roses are fresh given that they are in the fridge and
the knowledge that she presumably has that roses kept in a fridge
remain fresh. Note that the type of inference we are concerned with here is
<EM>object-</EM>inference and not <EM>meta</EM>-inference as in miscommunication
capability.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Object learning</STRONG>
<DD> 
We construe learning here in a somewhat broader
sense than in much traditional machine learning, just remembering
facts also counts as learning for us<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="footnode.html#249"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>. Those facts include not only
facts about the world, but can also include certain linguistic facts
like word definitions. If an agent cannot remember what is mentioned
in the previous utterances, that agent cannot be a good
conversationalist. Note the distinction between this ``object''
property and the history aspect of miscommunication competence. Here
we are just concerned with representing a new fact in the agent's
mind, whereas the fact that the agent did not know the new fact before
it was mentioned would be relevant to the meta-communication aspect.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
There is a lot of knowledge
that the agent uses in conjunction with these computational processes. This 
includes knowledge about socio-linguistic rules, discourse
rules, and other pragmatic rules.
<P>
These three capabilities, we refer to as ``object'' abilities in
contrast to the meta abilities of miscommunication competence
discussed in the next section.
