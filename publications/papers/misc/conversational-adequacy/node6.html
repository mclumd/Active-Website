Hymes [<A HREF="node24.html#hymescommunicative"></A>] and Campbell and Wales
[<A HREF="node24.html#campbellwalesstudy"></A>] among others reacted to Chomsky's
[<A HREF="node24.html#chomskyaspects">Chomsky1965</A>] notion of linguistic competence by introducing
the idea of communicative competence. They thought that linguistic
competence represented only part of what one needs to know to be a
competent language user. The language user should have `` the
ability to produce utterances which are not so much grammatical but,
more important, appropriate to the context in which they are made.''
([<A HREF="node24.html#campbellwalesstudy"></A>]. 
 Hymes listed four aspects of
communicative competence:
<P>
<OL><LI>
Whether something is formally <EM>possible</EM>. This corresponds to Chomsky's
grammatical competence.<LI>
Whether something is <EM>feasible</EM> with the means available. This is concerned
with psychological factors as memory limitation and the effects of properties
like nesting and so on.<LI>
Whether something is <EM>appropriate</EM> in the context in which it is said.<LI>
Whether something is in fact <EM>performed</EM>, and how often.
</OL>
<P>
Hymes' communicative competence goes further than just grammatical 
knowledge and includes psychological and socio-linguistic factors that
address the fact that communication takes place in a context.
<P>
The notion of communicative competence was taken up by various groups
of researchers, including those in second language learning like
Canale and Swain [<A HREF="node24.html#canaleswaintheoretical">Canale &amp;
  Swain1980</A>, <A HREF="node24.html#canalefrom">Canale1983</A>]. They too
had four aspects of communicative competence:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Grammatical competence</STRONG>
<DD>
This corresponds to Hymes' first aspect and includes
knowledge of the lexicon, syntax and semantics.
<DT><STRONG>Sociolingistic competence</STRONG>
<DD>
This is concerned with the appropriateness of
communication depending on the context including the participants and the
rules for interaction.
<DT><STRONG>Discourse competence</STRONG>
<DD>
This is concerned with the cohesion and coherence of
utterances in a discourse.
<DT><STRONG>Strategic competence</STRONG>
<DD>
This is the set of strategies that are put into
use when communication fails. These are of two main types: grammatical
strategies that are used when grammatical competence fails, and
socio-linguistic strategies that are used in situations when the
socio-linguistic competence is inadequate. Some of the strategies mentioned
in [<A HREF="node24.html#taronesome">Tarone1981</A>] are: approximation, circumlocution,
repetition, emphasis, asking for help, miming, avoiding the
problematic concepts, and abandoning an utterance already initiated.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Strategic competence is useful in various circumstances like the early
stages of second language learning [<A HREF="node24.html#canaleswaintheoretical">Canale &amp;
  Swain1980</A>],
for instance. Savignon [<A HREF="node24.html#savignoncommunicative">Savignon1983</A>] notes that
communicative competence can be present in the absence of grammatical
or discourse competence. But communicative competence can be present
with just strategic and socio-linguistic competence: one can
communicate non-verbally provided there is a cooperative
interlocutor. She further points out that
<BLOCKQUOTE> The inclusion of strategic competence as a component of communicative
competence at all levels is important because it demonstrates that
regardless of experience and level of proficiency one never knows <EM>all</EM>
[her emphasis] a language.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Savignon seems to be pointing to (but does not explicitly propose) the <EM>
necessity</EM> and the <EM>sufficiency</EM> (with socio-linguistic competence)
of strategic competence for communicative competence.
<P>
An example of the use of strategic competence from
[<A HREF="node24.html#savignoncommunicative">Savignon1983</A>] is shown in Figure <A HREF="node6.html#savignon">1</A>.
In this example, breakdown in communication is caused by differences
in pronunciation. The Frenchman detects the problem and tries to solve
it using repetition, emphasis, and finally he abandons the message
altogether.  This also illustrates the negotiation of meaning involved
in the use of strategic competence as noted in [<A HREF="node24.html#taronesome">Tarone1981</A>].
<P>
Tarone also includes as a necessary criterion for the
use of strategic competence the requirement that the speaker be aware
that the linguistic structure needed to convey his meaning is not
available to him or to the hearer. This leads to the use of the strategies
to help getting the meaning across. We note that this requires the speaker
to recognize a meta-linguistic problem.
<P>
As will be seen later, our notion of conversational adequacy is
similar to these notions of communication competence. Also, strategic
competence is similar to a meta-linguistic/meta-reasoning competence
(that we define later) that we think is essential in conversation and
we argue for the necessity and sufficiency of this competence.
