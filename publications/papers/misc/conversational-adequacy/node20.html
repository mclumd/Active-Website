Mystery won the second prize in the 1995 competition. It is available 
via telnet at debra.dgbt.doc.ca on port 3000.

<P>
     Yo.
     I'm here.
<P>
<i>  My name is Don.</i>
<P>
     I'm Joe Spansen.
</TT>
<P>
<TT>
<P>
     I'm a cleaner.  I empty trash.  Vacuum.  Dust.  You know.
<P>
<i>  So you know what a vacuum is?</i>
<P>
     What?
<P>
<i>  You just used the word &quot;vacuum&quot; a moment ago.</i>
<P>
     I don't know.
<P>
<i>  A vacuum is a device you use to vacuum dust.</i>
<P>
     Huh?
<P>
<i>  What is a vacuum?</i>
<P>
     Beats me.
<P>
<i>  How do you vacuum?</i>
<P>
     What do you mean?
<P>
<i>  You told me that you vacuum.  </i>
<P>
     What?
<P>
<i>  Can you vacuum?</i>
<P>
     I don't know.
<P>
<i>  To vacuum is to clean with a suction device.</i>
<P>
     Yeah.  I work real hard.  No one keeps their building as clean as me. 
It's not fair that they want to fire me.
     It's just because my boss, Mr. Johnson, is mad at me.
</TT>
<P>
The above exchange seems to indicate that the program is unable to reason
about its own utterances or about dialog in general. This in turn appears
to make it impossible for there to be a ``meeting of minds'' when 
miscommunication occurs, or indeed for there to be a recognition of
miscommunication. This and most other ``Turing Test'' programs are very
good at ``running-on'': they keep a superficial semblance of conversation 
going. The above continues:
<P>
<TT>
<P>
<i>  If you vacuum with a Hoover, he won't fire you.</i>
<P>
     Oh, they'll fire me for sure.  I know what they're thinking.
     They haven't said they're gonna fire me yet because they gotta keep me
around to clean until they can find someone else to hire.  Then they'll fire me
for some other reason that won't make problems with the union.  They fire lots
of cleaners.  They'll just say I'm a bad cleaner.  They fired my friend, Fred
two years ago because they said he was a bad cleaner.
<P>
<i>  Vacuum  with a Hoover.</i>
<P>
     Huh?
<P>
<i>  A Hoover will impress Mr, Johnson so much he will give you a raise.</i>
<P>
     Beats me.
<P>
<i>  Fred wasn't fired.</i>
<P>
     Yeah.  He's one of the guys in our group.
     Just some guys from work.  We hang out together.  Do stuff.  You know.
<P>
<i>  You are wrong about Fred. He wasn't fired.</i>
<P>
     We usually go down to the club and drink beer and stuff.
</TT>
<P>
The program is oblivious to the direct contradiction between what it
said (Fred was fired) and our rejoinder to the contrary. This is another
telltale sign of conversational inadequacy: a meeting of minds requires
above all the ability to notice when minds (and utterances) suffer a
mismatch.
