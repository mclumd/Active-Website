<h3>Notes:</h3>
This unsatisfactory system response was the state-of-the-art prior to our work.<br>
Our recent work allows the system to alter its response when appropriate.<br>
Our current efforts will allow the system to initiate question-answer exchanges for clarification.<br>
<br>
Our model works via a step-wise transformation of the literal request made by a user (e.g. “Send the Chicago train to Philadelphia”) into a specific request for an action that can be performed by the system or domain.  In the case of “the Chicago train”, the system we have implemented is able to interpret this as “the train in Chicago”, and then further disambiguate this into a specific train currently at Chicago station, which it will send to Philadelphia. Information about each step in the transformation is maintained (explicitly representing the knowledge state at each stage), to accommodate any repairs that might be required in the case of negative feedback (if for instance, as above, the system picks the wrong train, and the user says “No” in response to the action).<br>
<br>
This implementation represents an advance not just in its ability to reason initially about the user's intention (e.g., by “the Chicago train” the user means . . .) but in its ability to respond in a context sensitive way to post-action user feedback, and use that feedback to aid in the interpretation of the user's original and future intentions. (For instance, if the user says “No, send the Chicago train to Philadelphia” the system is able to identify its mistake as its choice of referent for “the Chicago train”, and choose a different train; if there are no other trains in Chicago, it tells the user: “Please specify the train by name”)<br>
<br>
However, although our current system is able to respond in this way to post-action user feedback, the actual transformation of the user's utterance from its literal form into a performable request takes place without user feedback.  We believe that a system which could request and utilize user feedback in this process---one, that is, which contained a more robust metadialogic component---would represent a significant advance.<br>
