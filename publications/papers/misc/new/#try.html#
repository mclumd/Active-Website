      <p><b>Introduction to Active Logic</b></p>
      <p>The real world is complex, dynamic, and not completely knowable. What 
        is true now may not have been true before, or for much longer, and more 
        can always be discovered. Any system that purports to model the world 
        (or any part of it) must be able to accommodate such changes. Furthermore, 
        any reasoning about the world takes place under conditions of uncertainty, 
        because changes in what is true of, or known about the world can require 
        revisions to simple beliefs, derived conclusions, generalizations, and 
        even heuristics for thinking. Systems that hope to accomplish this latter 
        task must be flexible enough to recognize and gracefully handle these 
        situations, and recover from the contradictions, inconsistencies, and 
        irregularities that they involve. </p>
      
      <p><b>Active Logic </b>is a formalism that has been developed with real-world 
        applications and their challenges in mind. Motivating its design is the 
        thought that one of the factors that supports the flexibility of human 
        reasoning is that it takes place step-wise, in time. Active Logic is one 
        of a family on inference engines (step-logics) that explicitly reason 
        in time, and incorporate a history of their reasoning as they run. This 
        characteristic makes Active Logic systems more flexible than traditional 
        AI systems and therefore more suitable for commonsense, real-world reasoning.</p>
      <p>One important strategy that we employ in our systems is <b>metareasoning</b>. 
        Because Active Logic tracks its reasoning, it is able to reason about 
        its own inferences, and thereby recognize and recover from errors. We 
        hypothesize the existence of a limited and formalizable set of generic 
        strategies of metareasoning, which are central to the human ability to 
        deal easily and smoothly with mistakes, contradictions, and other irregularities. 
        We think that one area in which these strategies are most apparent, and 
        most often used, is in <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/active/doc/new/topics/conv_adq.html">conversation</a>, 
        and so a central area of our <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/active/doc/new/topics/res_topics.html">research</a> 
        has been focused on understanding natural language dialog. </p>
