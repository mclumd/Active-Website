	Active logics are a family of inference engines that incorporate a history
	of their reasoning as they run. This characteristic makes Active Logic 
	systems more flexible than traditional AI systems and therefore more
	suitable for commonsense reasoning.

	<p align=justify>
	Commonsense reasoning using active logics is a major theme in our research
	and we have been performing a number of experiments in that area.
