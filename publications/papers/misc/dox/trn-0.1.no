G: Giver
F: Follower
      
-2 G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then
      you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...
-1 F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?
-0 G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of
      the ravine ...


-- G: And then you connected to the two last points, and now I'm telling
      you to go due north, and you're going to go right through a river?
-- F: Yeah.  {ip|Cause=Because} the rope bridge is ... {fp|er} above and to
      the right of the banana tree.
-- G: Yeah?  So the river should {ph|beee=be} to the right of the banana
      trees.
-- F: Yeah.  But you told me to go to the left of banana tree.
-- G: Yeah.  The left of the banana trees.
-- F: Okay.  I get you.  Okay.
-- G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.
-- F: Yeah.
-2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
-1 F: I'll go right to the rope rope bridge.
-0 G: No, you want to go due north ...
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point
      and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a
      little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of
      the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?


-2 G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...
-1 F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
-0 G: Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.


-2 G: Have you got any ...
-1 F: {fp|Er} I have lost steps but they're ... very far north of the
      waterfall.
-0 G: Okay.  No, no, no.  What you {fp|er} ... You have to go ... four
      fingers up, and then start turning to the left.  Have you got {br|f
      fallen=fallen} pillars?
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: Okay.  You'll be going ... north, just above the pillars, and then
     you'll be turning ... west ...


-2 G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and
      you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.
-1 F: Below the writing?
-0 G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre
      below the writing.
+1 F: All right.
+2 G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.


-4 G: Okay.  Along the edge of the waterfalls, have you got ... lost steps?
      Above?
-3 F: No.
-2 G: {gg|Hmm}.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you want me to go over the waterfalls?
-0 G: No.  Alongside of it.
+1 F: Up?
+2 G: {fg|Eh} up north.


-2 G: Okay ... {gg|Oh}!  All right. ... Okay, so now you're going to go
      ... to the left-hand side ... of the forest fire site ... and go
      ... straight down south.
-1 F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?
-0 G: No.  No.  Go west.
+1 F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.
+2 G: Yeah.


-2 G: Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit {br|north
      east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ... until you come to
      in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your stopping point would be
      {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south}
      west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You see that, way up there?
      But you're still {ab|s} ...
-1 F: So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?
-0 G: No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line
      with the southeast corner ...
+1 F: So I go ...
+2 G: southwest corner, sorry, of east lake.


-2 G: You're going south.
-1 F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled
      street, I'm going before it?
-0 G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost
      ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.
+1 F: Okay.  All right, got you.
+2 G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?


-2 G: To the east of it?
-1 F: A tyre swing?
-0 G: {fp|Uh}, no, to the east of it, further.  My map's empty here.
+1 F: A privately owned fields?
+2 G: Privately owned fields.


-2 G: {fp|Uh} over the {ab|r} ... over the granite quarry ... down towards
      the train crossing and up along the west side ... of the {fp|uh}
      waterfall.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I'm going around the train crossing?  Underneath
      it?
-0 G: No, you're going over top of the train quarry or the {ab|r} {fp|uh}
      train crossing.
+1 F: Going on top of the train crossing ...
+2 G: and along the west side of the {fp|uh} waterfall.


-6 G: {gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you
      ... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to
      the point where you head north ...
-5 F: Okay.
-4 G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.
-3 F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...
-2 G: Sure.
-1 F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
-0 G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.
+1 F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.
+2 G: Yeah.


-- G: Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to make a little
      curve out, so that you're back in line with the ... the start ... So
      you're going to {ab|g} ... like, curve in at the {le|b}. Just make a
      little curve in ...
-- F: Yeah.
-- G: then curve back out ... and then, at the bottom of the ravine, not the
      word {ci|ravine}, the ravine itself ...
-- F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
-- G: you're going to head west.
-- F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve
      ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?
-2 G: Right.
-1 F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?
-0 G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: go west.


-- G: Okay, curve over top of the {fp|uh} ... I guess you said it was a
      ... side walk?  Public park?
-- F: Okay.
-- G: And down towards the {fp|uh} fallen ...
-- F: Fallen cairn.  {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
-2 G: Okay.
-1 F: Do I go from ... the {br|north east=northeast} corner of the
      waterfall straight down, to the rocks?
-0 G: No, you have to curve over your {fp|uh} {fp|eh} curve ...
+1 F: {ab|T} ...
+2 G: up ...


-2 G: {fp|Er} ... {br|Y you're=You're} headed {fp|er} {br|s
      straight=straight} straight north and then go over top of the granite
      site.  To the left.
-1 F: So I go around the left-hand side of it?
-0 G: No.  You go ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You go over ... the right-hand side
      of it.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: The east side.  Come over the top, and then down ... the west.


______________________________________________________________________________
-2 F: A {ab|bana} ...
-1 G: I've got gorillas.  Do you have gorillas?
-0 F: No I don't.
+1 G: Okay.  I I think gorillas and banana bush are sharing the same thing
      here.  So proceed west to that ...
+2 F: All right.
 
 
-2 G: So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed
      ... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that
      wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading northerly or {ab|eith}
      even slightly west of north, going up the east side of that wagon
      wheel.
-1 F: Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?
-0 G: No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...
+1 F: You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...
+2 G: Towards ...
 
 
-2 G: {gg|Oh} just so that you're in line, sorry, just so that you're in
      line with the word {ci|granite quarry}.
-1 F: Okay.  So just go ... just basically {br|south east=southeast} until
      I hit the granite quarry.  Okay.  And then from there?
-0 G: {ph|Wa} No, no.  You you've gone up over top of the granite quarry,
      right?
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Okay.  Then come down ... southeast, yeah?
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh}, a banana tree?
-1 F: Yeah.
-0 G: No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?
+1 F: That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.
+2 G: Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at
      one point.
 
 
-2 G: {gg|Mmm}?
-1 F: That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...
-0 G: {fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van is
      due south of the camera shop.
+1 F: Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the
      middle of them.
+2 G: Bring the van over?
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand
      side or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something
      in between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five
      fingers' breadth ...
-1 F: Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?
-0 G: {fg|Oh}.  No. You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't
      have west lake.
+1 F: Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.
+2 G: Okay.  Well ...
 
 
-6 G: {gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you
      ... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to
      the point where you head north ...
-5 F: Okay.
-4 G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.
-3 F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...
-2 G: Sure.
-1 F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
-0 G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.
+1 F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.
+2 G: Yeah.
 
 
-- G: Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to make a little
      curve out, so that you're back in line with the ... the start ... So
      you're going to {ab|g} ... like, curve in at the {le|b}. Just make a
      little curve in ...
-- F: Yeah.
-- G: then curve back out ... and then, at the bottom of the ravine, not the
      word {ci|ravine}, the ravine itself ...
-- F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
-- G: you're going to head west.
-- F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve
      ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?
-2 G: Right.
-1 F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?
-0 G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: go west.
 

-2 G: Just ... In line with it.
-1 F: Okay.  So, from the ravine I'm going west ... until I'm on with
      start?
-0 G: No, no, no.  From the burnt forest ...
+1 F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
+2 G: you make your little curve ...
 
 
-2 G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then
      you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...
-1 F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?
-0 G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of
      the ravine ...
 
 
-2 G: Can you do that? ...
-1 F: Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve
      over the top of this carpenter's ...
-0 G: No, no, no.
+1 F: Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...
+2 G: Right.  Then go east ...
 
-0 F: No.
-0 F: {fp|Er} no ...
 
 
 
-2 G: A fort?  A fort, yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, to {ab|th} ...
-1 F: Now, is the creek underneath ... above the rapids?
-0 G: The {ab|r} ... The ... No, the {fp|er} ... The rapids is above the
      fort, right?
+1 F: {fg|Ah} yes it is.
+2 G: Okay, then to the right of that you'll have outlaws' ... {fp|er}
      hideaway?  Or hideout?
 
 
-2 G: Okay, we're heading east from adventure
      {ph|playcrowned=playground}. We go about three-quarters of the way
      across the page.  Do you have anything there?
-1 F: {fp|Uh}, I've I've got privately owned fields above adventure
      playground to the right and {ph|belowww=below} it to the right I have
      farmyard.
-0 G: Yeah, okay, no problem then.  Okay, privately owned field?
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Be ... Okay. And then we go ... north, after we're across
      three-quarters of the page and we go up and we got granite quarry.
      Do you have that?
 
 
-2 G: Yeah.
-1 F: Not where the finish line is?
-0 G: No, not where the finish line is.
+1 F: That's the southwest corner.
+2 G: That's right.  Southeast corner.
 
 
-2 G: You're going south.
-1 F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled
      street, I'm going before it?
-0 G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost
      ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.
+1 F: Okay.  All right, got you.
+2 G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?
 
 
-2 G: To the east of it?
-1 F: A tyre swing?
-0 G: {fp|Uh}, no, to the east of it, further.  My map's empty here.
+1 F: A privately owned fields?
+2 G: Privately owned fields.
 
 
-2 G: Okay, curve down towards the train crossing ... and up along the west
      side of the waterfall.  Stop when you get to the top of the
      waterfall.
-1 F: Wait, my train crossing is {fp|um} {br|north west=northwest} of the
      waterfall.
-0 G: {fg|Oh} no no, not that train crossing.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: Okay ...
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh} over the {ab|r} ... over the granite quarry ... down towards
      the train crossing and up along the west side ... of the {fp|uh}
      waterfall.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I'm going around the train crossing?  Underneath
      it?
-0 G: No, you're going over top of the train quarry or the {ab|r} {fp|uh}
      train crossing.
+1 F: Going on top of the train crossing ...
+2 G: and along the west side of the {fp|uh} waterfall.
 

-- G: Okay, curve over top of the {fp|uh} ... I guess you said it was a
      ... side walk?  Public park?
-- F: Okay.
-- G: And down towards the {fp|uh} fallen ...
-- F: Fallen cairn.  {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
-2 G: Okay.
-1 F: Do I go from ... the {br|north east=northeast} corner of the
      waterfall straight down, to the rocks?
-0 G: No, you have to curve over your {fp|uh} {fp|eh} curve ...
+1 F: {ab|T} ...
+2 G: up ...
 
 
-2 G: {ip|Til=Until} you ...
-1 F: That corner?
-0 G: {ip|Til=Until} you hit the {fp|uh} ... No, just a bit away from the
      border.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: And when you get to the corner ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay, then you're going to ... {ab|l} make a small loop ... up,
      around left-hand side of the alpine gardens.  Stop at the top of
      alpine gardens.
-1 F: Dead centre top?
-0 G: No.
+1 F: Okay. ... Top left side?
+2 G: Top left.  Then go straight across the top to the top right-hand
      side.
 
 
-- G: And then you connected to the two last points, and now I'm telling
      you to go due north, and you're going to go right through a river?
-- F: Yeah.  {ip|Cause=Because} the rope bridge is ... {fp|er} above and to
      the right of the banana tree.
-- G: Yeah?  So the river should {ph|beee=be} to the right of the banana
      trees.
-- F: Yeah.  But you told me to go to the left of banana tree.
-- G: Yeah.  The left of the banana trees.
-- F: Okay.  I get you.  Okay.
-- G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.
-- F: Yeah.
-2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
-1 F: I'll go right to the rope rope bridge.
-0 G: No, you want to go due north ...
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point
      and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a
      little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of
      the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  Now what I want you ... Do you have any lost steps or
      {ph|staps=steps} or something like that?
-1 F: Lost steps.  {ph|Waaay=Way} way up, about {fp|er} ...
-0 G: Okay.  No, no.  {ab|I} I got different lost steps.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so
      what ... All right.  And then you have fallen pillars, right?
+1 F: {fp|Er}, right in the centre of the page.
+2 G: Yeah.  Okay.  Now, what I'm going to give you is an obstacle right
      beside fallen pillars, and you're going to have to go up ... So what
      I want you to do is go north from your last point ... until you are
      right in line ... with ... the middle of those pillars ...
 
 
-2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
-1 F: going over outlaws' hideout to get there?
-0 G: Over {fp|uh} ... No, you're going under the outlaws' hideout.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
 
 
-2 G: And then go west {fp|uh} about three inches ...
-1 F: Yes.  What's over there?
-0 G: {fp|Uh} stop there and {fp|uh} begin {fp|uh} ... curve, that is
      {fp|uh} dip, for {fp|uh} ... half an inch, no more than that.
+1 F: Yeah, I got a palm tree over there.
+2 G: {fp|Uh} so go around the palm tree.
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh} then {fp|uh} ... go ... go east for {fp|uh} one and a half
      inch ...
-1 F: Is there anything over there?
-0 G: {fp|Uh} no.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: {fp|Uh} then make a slight curve and go ... up north for about
      {fp|uh} two inches to the {ab|r} ... to the ... {fp|uh} and end to
      the ... left of the old temple.
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh} then go {fp|uh} ... {br|north west=northwest} for about an
      inch ...
-1 F: Do you have the state mountain?
-0 G: No {ab|A=I} ... No I don't.
+1 F: {ab|D} ...
+2 G: But I guess you have to go ... {fp|uh} around that.
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh}, once you get to the {ab|k} {le|k}, go under the phrase
      ... right under the phrase {ci|abandoned truck} ...
-1 F: Seen.
-0 G: {fp|Uh} when you get to {le|a} ... {fp|uh} make a {ab|s} ... very
      slight curve and go down for about ... {fp|Er} do you have baboons?
      No you don't. {fp|Uh} ... when you get to {le|a} go straight down for
      about {fp|uh} ... one inch ... ending with a slight curve and then
      turn {fp|uh} ... west and go {ab|a} another {fp|uh} inch to the west
      ...
+1 F: Seen.
+2 G: And then {fp|uh} go {fp|uh} ... Do you have white mountain?
 
 
-2 G: Yeah.
-1 F: Yes.  You got the lemon grove there?
-0 G: {fp|Uh} {ph|nnno=no} I don't.
+1 F: Okay, do you got the poison stream?
+2 G: {fp|Uh} yes there is one.
 

-2 G: Now I want you to curve to the right going due east ...
-1 F: Yeah.
-0 G: for about two and a half {ab|inche} ... no, three inches ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: Two and a half inches.
 
 
-2 G: and stop at the {le|a}.
-1 F: In {ci|monastery}?
-0 G: No.  The first {le|a} ...
+1 F: {fg|Oh}!
+2 G: {ci|abandoned}.
 
 
-2 G: Pebbled shore.
-1 F: You got washed stones?
-0 G: {fp|Uh}, no I don't.  Okay, {fp|uh} you are parallel with the bottom
      of the letter {le|c}?
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: {fp|Uh} go now an inch to the west ...
 
 
-2 G: until {fp|er} ... {ip|til=until} you reach ... you reach the
      gorillas. Now you want to ... You want to stay on the left-hand side
      of the gorillas.
-1 F: The {ab|gori} ... Okay, the gorillas are just an inch and a {ab|ha}
      ... So ... You know the river?  Do you have a straight river?
-0 G: No I don't.
+1 F: {gg|Oh}, okay.  Reference rope bridge ...
+2 G: Yeah.
 
 
-2 G: Okay.
-1 F: So, do you ... Do I go ... Do I go ... Which side do I go?  Above the
      rock fall or below the rock fall?
-0 G: No, you go above the rock fall.
+1 F: Okay, so I'm above the rock fall, I do have a white mountain.
+2 G: Okay.  Basically you want to ... The way the the mountain peak goes
      you do the exact same thing, sticking right by it.  You go up on the
      {fp|er} northeast trajectory, when you reach the peak you come down
      on the southeast trajectory.
 
 
-2 G: But {ab|st} ... Or, rapids. ... Okay?
-1 F: So I'm just above ... rapids, and go left?
-0 G: No, stay below the top of ... rapids, and then come up over it.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: Okay.  {fg|Erm} ... You go over the top of rapids ...
 
 
-2 G: Yes.
-1 F: Will I be coming across underneath the privately owned fields first?
-0 G: Privately owned fields?  No, you should be going ... Yeah, underneath
      that.
+1 F: Okay, let me put this differently.  Do you have the farmyard?
+2 G: Yes.
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Uh}, the start of the milk jug.
-1 F: All right. Then back towards granite quarry on the left side?
-0 G: No, no, on the right-hand side, around the top.  And when you get to
      the second peak, stop.
+1 F: Got it.
+2 G: Okay, do you have train crossing?
 
-0 F: No I do not.
 
-2 G: Okay, from where I left you we're going to be heading underneath
      fallen cairn.  Okay?
-1 F: All right.  Is there {ab|n} ... Okay.  Do you have public footpath?
-0 G: No.
+1 F: It is ... up one inch and right one inch up from waterfall.  Is there
      anything between fallen cairn and {ab|publi} {fp|uh} public footpath?
+2 G: I have nothing.
 
 
-2 G: Go straight up the page ... {ip|til=until} you get to ... the base
      ... even with pyramid, if you have it.
-1 F: Do you have lemon grove?
-0 G: No.
+1 F: I have pyramid ...
+2 G: Okay.
 

-2 G: you straighten out.
-1 F: Straight south?
-0 G: No.  No.  No.  Straight {fp|er} west.

+2 G: Yeah.  You're you're on top of the ... the train crossing ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay, now, yeah.  You {fp|er} ...
-1 F: I go over top of it?
-0 G: No ... No.  I don't ... I don't have the ... I don't have the
      footpath on my map at all.  So looks like you want to avoid that.
+1 F: Okay.  So I'm at the tip of the waterfall still.
+2 G: Okay.  Now, {ph|hya} ... Have you gone ... Have you gone {fp|er} ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  So {fg|erm}, go ... left and {ab|s} ... and down, like on a
      ... bit of a slant ... and then down the {ab|l} ... to the left-hand
      corner of remote village ...
-1 F: {fg|Er}, do I cross {ph|theeee} ... {fp|er} ... cobbled street?
-0 G: No.  No you don't.  You ... keep it {fg|er} ... Okay, cobbled street
      ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: the left-hand edge of it ... is just a little bit ... past the corner
      of the pyramid.  So go out a little bit ...
 
 
-2 G: You have an avalanche?
-1 F: Do you have an avalanche?
-0 G: No I don't.  That's what it is.  Okay, you want to swing out
      {ab|arou} ...
+1 F: {fg|Oh}, hang on a sec ... avalanche.  Reference {fp|uh} the {le|e}
      in {ci|pine grove}, the last {le|e}?
+2 G: Yeah.
 
 
-2 G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...
-1 F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
-0 G: Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.
 
 
-2 G: White museum right below the abandoned monastery?
-1 F: Yes, right below {ph|aaaand=and} you have west lake?
-0 G: {fp|Er}, no I don't.
+1 F: Okay.  From your start point ... right above it is west lake {fp|er}
      ... There's {ph|aaa=a} ... about ... Okay, from ... allotments ... go
      ... two o'clock ... about three fingers ... and that's {fp|er} flight
      museum.
+2 G: Flight museum, two fingers ... two o'clock?
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  To the left of rocks you have a stone creek ... and above
      white water you have {fp|er} ... stone creek and {fp|er} ... White
      water and stone creek are {ph|fffairly=fairly} close together ...
-1 F: Okay.
-0 G: {fg|Er}, no more than {fp|er} ... I'd say, an inch separates the
      {fp|er} ... stone creek from the white water ... on the right-hand
      corner, top.
+1 F: {ab|O} ... Okay.
+2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You're going to take that line ... and {fp|er} on the
      {fp|er} ... rocks, the second boulder ... the large boulder ...
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Er} ... {br|Y you're=You're} headed {fp|er} {br|s
      straight=straight} straight north and then go over top of the granite
      site.  To the left.
-1 F: So I go around the left-hand side of it?
-0 G: No.  You go ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You go over ... the right-hand side
      of it.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: The east side.  Come over the top, and then down ... the west.
 
 
-2 G: {fg|Er} ... well, {ab|a} ... Where's the banana tree in relation to
      the footbridge?
-1 F: {gg|Oh}, you don't have a banana tree?
-0 G: No I don't.
+1 F: {gg|Oh} okay.  {fg|Erm} ... the banana tree is ...
+2 G: Is it below baboons?
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  Now between old temple and footbridge, you have a poisoned
      stream.
-1 F: Okay.
-0 G: The poisoned stream ... is ... {ab|a} ... no more ... than an inch
      from the footbridge.  Actually I'd say about three-quarter of an
      inches ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: So, they're very close.  So, between the ... the {ph|dyer} the
      poisoned stream and the footbridge ... I want you to take the line
      and go directly {fp|er} {br|i i in=in} the centre, down ... south,
      about ... an inch.
 
 
-2 G: {ab|T} yeah ... Three inches below.
-1 F: Okay.
-0 G: And allotments of course {fp|uh} ... is no more than two inches above
      parked van.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: Okay.  I want you to take the line and go ... on the west side of
      camera shop ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  If you draw a {ab|ma} an imaginary line at the top of
      allotments {ab|acr} straight across ...
-1 F: Yeah.
-0 G: your ... arc ... the line should be no more than ... {fp|uh}
      ... three-quarters of an inch.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: Okay?
 
 
-2 G: Okay, now you stop at the edge, of abandoned {br|mo
      monastery=monastery}.
-1 F: Okay, you want me to bring it up to the monastery?
-0 G: {ab|Ye} ... no no no no.  Just just ... that diagonal line ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: across to the ... you know the the east edge ... but but you know but
      below abandoned monastery just {fp|uh} {ab|y} {fp|uh} {ab|y} ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  Where's where's the lake in relation to the abandoned
      monastery? Are they {fp|uh} parallel?  I mean, are they in line with
      each other?
-1 F: {fg|Oh}, you don't ... {fg|Oh} sorry, you don't have the lake on?
-0 G: No, I don't.
+1 F: Okay, if I ... If I take my line, like two inches southwest from
      ... that corner of the monastery I'm at ... {ph|thiii=the} {fp|uh}
      northeastern corner of the lake.
+2 G: Okay.  A a {ab|b} a better reference ... Use use the alpine
      garden. Going down from there ...
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  Okay, okay.  Where the word {ci|abandoned monastery} is ...
-1 F: Yeah.
-0 G: Okay, now you take that line and you're going to arc it down so
      you're no more than about half an inch away from the {le|a} ... where
      the line ... {ab|wher} ...
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: {ab|wher} where the arc line stops.  Okay?
 
 
-2 G: you're now going east, for about an inch ...
-1 F: Over {fg|eh} ... Going west?
-0 G: No, you're you're going east. You're going east now.  Stop there.
      You you ...
+1 F: When I went across the top of the alpine garden I thought I went up
      ... I thought I went up the eastern edge.
+2 G: Yeah, right across the top of {ab|alpi} alpine garden.  Okay.  You're
      going east.  Okay, do you have a youth hostel?
 
 
-2 G: Okay, thatched ... If ... Okay, thatched hut ... is approximately
      ... an inch and a half ... in, to east lake, if you draw an imaginary
      line. You know, offset into it?  To {ab|ju} ... But below it.  It's
      about {fp|uh} an inch and a half below east lake ...
-1 F: Okay.
-0 G: And about an inch and a half ... into east lake.  Okay, {ab|no}
      ... the finish line ... Go to east lake.  Go along the south shore,
      {ip|til=until} you come to a {fp|uh} ... a little bay, just where it
      juts up north ...
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Okay.  From there, go out about an ... half an inch ... That's your
      finish line right there ...
 
 
-2 G: {fp|Er}, boathouse?
-1 F: Yeah.
-0 G: No?
+1 F: Yeah!
+2 G: {fp|Er}, there's two, {fg|eh}?
 
 
-2 G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and
      you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.
-1 F: Below the writing?
-0 G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre
      below the writing.
+1 F: All right.
+2 G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.
 
 
-2 G: From where I left you, you have to go ... {fp|er} ... southwest, down
      {br|gent ly=gently} ... until you're underneath the ... {fp|er}
      noose, you're about five centimetres underneath the noose.
-1 F: I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not one centimetres away from the noose?
-0 G: No.  You're about ...
+1 F: Five centimetres.
+2 G: five centimetres down.
 
 
-2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Reference the peak of the {fp|er} saloon ... Go four
      centimetres to your left ...
-1 F: From ... from where the {le|s} is?
-0 G: No.  {ab|Fr} ... Okay.  {ab|G} Look at the top of the {fp|er} ...
+1 F: I seen it.
+2 G: saloon ...
 
 
-2 G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about
      three centimetres straight across.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?
-0 G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no,
      you're going to go above it, between there and the word
      {ci|waterfall}.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an
      angle ... and then go straight across ...
 
 
-2 G: {ph|S} ... From where you are.
-1 F: {ph|As=Is} that going to be the top of the pyramid?
-0 G: No, it would be right at the base.
+1 F: At the base.  I have a lemon grove right in the middle.
+2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You've got to make sure you don't run over the lemon
      grove.
 
 
-2 G: And then you go back to the left so you're ... straight down from
      where you started, from the start.  You just ... You just ... go out
      to the right ... about half centimetre below the {le|b}, just swerve
      out to the right and then swing back.
-1 F: Okay.  Do you have a carpenter's cottage?
-0 G: No I don't.
+1 F: Okay.  I think that's what you're going around.  Anyways ...
+2 G: Yeah.  That will be it. And then, go down about another ... inch from
      there {ip|til=until} you're ... parallel to the top ... of the word
      {ci|ravine} ...
 
 
-2 G: It's it's kind of {fp|er} ... I don't know what you'd call it.
-1 F: Do you have avalanche on yours?
-0 G: No I don't.  That's why I don't know what it looks like.
+1 F: How close does your route go to the side of the page?
+2 G: About five centimetres.
 
 
-2 G: {ab|Ok} okay.  From the {le|p} ... you go out as far as the
      {le|v}. And you're about ... two centimetres straight down from the
      {le|v}. That's as far as you go out.
-1 F: Okay.  And I hook around the ...
-0 G: {br|A and=And} then you ... And then ... you start to ... No, you
      don't go down to the concealed hideout yet.  You turn back to the
      left ... {fp|erm} ... {ab|unti} ...
+1 F: And I'm at the bottom of the avalanche now.
+2 G: until you're underneath the {le|g} ... about a centimetre down.
 
 
-2 G: {ph|goooooo=go} down ... until you're even with the {le|c} in
      {ci|camera shop} ...
-1 F: Am I making a loop?
-0 G: {fp|Er}, no.  You're just going straight down, almost.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: It's a gentle loop.
 
 
-2 G: Okay ...
-1 F: Over it?
-0 G: No.  {ph|nn-nn} ... This'll be a bit tricky.  {ab|G} {fp|uh} at the
      {br|w west=west} tip in the middle ...
+1 F: West tip in the middle?  Yeah.
+2 G: {ab|Oka} {ab|we} you have a mark, {le|x}, right?
 
 
-2 G: Okay, take your line and go ...
-1 F: Around it?
-0 G: No, you're going under it, just ... go under it closer to the pine
      grove ...
+1 F: Okay, so do I go straight across?
+2 G: Yeah.
 
 
-2 G: Okay.  You have something underneath pebbled shore?
-1 F: Yeah, I got to go in between it?
-0 G: No, go around it further to the left ...
+1 F: Right.
+2 G: Okay?  Now ... {ab|f} continue the loop around, and you see the
      flagship?
