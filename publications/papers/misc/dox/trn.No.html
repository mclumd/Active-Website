<a href="transcript.1.html#69">**</a>G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre below the writing.<br>
+1F: All right.<br>
+2G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three centimetres straight across.<br>
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#72">**</a>G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.<br>
+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an angle ... and then go straight across ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: To the east of it?<br>

<a href="transcript.1.html#12">**</a>G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...<br>
+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: go west.<br>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<hr><p>
-2G: So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed ... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading northerly or {ab|eith} even slightly west of north, going up the east side of that wagon wheel.<br>
-1F: Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#0">**</a>G: No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...<br>
+1F: You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...<br>
+2G: Towards ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: And you then can proceed about four fingers past the rocks, so that you're now {ab|w} ... {ab|s} west southwest of the rocks about three or four fingers.  On your north side there should be a stone creek.<br>
-1F: No.  Don't have it.<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#1">**</a>G: No stone creek.  Well it's there, and what you do ...<br>
+1F: {gg|Oh} Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!<br>
+2G: {gg|Oh}.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Well, you're heading toward the swamp, but you don't go anyplace near the swamp, you cut a sharp left, heading south west and then south, around that white water, so you're actually passing counter-clockwise around the white water or the rapids.<br>
-1F: Okay.  So am I going to go east, again?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#2">**</a>G: No ...<br>
+1F: Past ... No?<br>
+2G: you're then going to go south.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: and go ... straight down south.<br>
-1F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#3">**</a>G: No.  No.  Go west.<br>
+1F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: until you come to in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your stopping point would be {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south} west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You see that, way up there?  But you're still {ab|s} ...<br>
-1F: So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#4">**</a>G: No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line with the southeast corner ...<br>
+1F: So I go ...<br>
+2G: southwest corner, sorry, of east lake.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {gg|Oh} just so that you're in line, sorry, just so that you're in line with the word {ci|granite quarry}.<br>
-1F: Okay.  So just go ... just basically {br|south east=southeast} until I hit the granite quarry.  Okay.  And then from there?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#5">**</a>G: {ph|Wa} No, no.  You you've gone up over top of the granite quarry, right?<br>
+1F: Yeah.<br>
+2G: Okay.  Then come down ... southeast, yeah?<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Okay.  Do you have a limestone cliffs way off to the {ab|we} ... the east, sorry?<br>
-1F: No.<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#6">**</a>G: No.  Okay. Let me see then. Okay.  You see the ... the southeast corner of east lake?<br>
+1F: Southeast corner?  Yeah.<br>
+2G: Yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ip|cause=because} you've stopped probably by now ... at the ... Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... You've come up straight towards the cornfields?<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {fp|Uh}, a banana tree?<br>
-1F: Yeah.<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#7">**</a>G: No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?<br>
+1F: That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.<br>
+2G: Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at one point.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {gg|Mmm}?<br>
-1F: That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#8">**</a>G: {fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van is due south of the camera shop.<br>
+1F: Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the middle of them.<br>
+2G: Bring the van over?<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand side or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something in between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five fingers' breadth ...<br>
-1F: Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#9">**</a>G: {fg|Oh}.  No. You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't have west lake.<br>
+1F: Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.<br>
+2G: Okay.  Well ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: But you just go a straight line, east northeast from the north west corner of the allotments.  Take it about eight fingers' breadth and that's where you then go due north to meet the {ab|r} east side of the abandoned monastery.<br>
-1F: Okay.  D'you have a flight museum?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#10">**</a>G: No.<br>
+1F: No, okay.  So I'm right at the {fp|uh} southeast corner ...<br>

+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: go west.<br>

<a href="transcript.1.html#15">**</a>G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.<br>

+2G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of the ravine ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Can you do that? ...<br>
-1F: Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve over the top of this carpenter's ...<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#16">**</a>G: No, no, no.<br>
+1F: Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...<br>

<hr><p>
-2G: Okay, we're heading east from adventure {ph|playcrowned=playground}. We go about three-quarters of the way across the page.  Do you have anything there?<br>

<a href="transcript.1.html#22">**</a>G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.<br>
+1F: Okay.  All right, got you.<br>
+2G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: To the east of it?<br>

+1F: {ab|T} ...<br>
+2G: up ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {ip|Til=Until} you ...<br>

<a href="transcript.1.html#30">**</a>G: No, you want to go due north ...<br>
+1F: Yeah.<br>
+2G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?<br>

+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: Okay.  If you draw a {ab|ma} an imaginary line at the top of allotments {ab|acr} straight across ...<br>

<hr><p>
-2G: Okay, thatched ... If ... Okay, thatched hut ... is approximately ... an inch and a half ... in, to east lake, if you draw an imaginary line. You know, offset into it?  To {ab|ju} ... But below it.  It's about {fp|uh} an inch and a half below east lake ...<br>
-1F: Okay.<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#67">**</a>G: And about an inch and a half ... into east lake.  Okay, {ab|no} ... the finish line ... Go to east lake.  Go along the south shore, {ip|til=until} you come to a {fp|uh} ... a little bay, just where it juts up north ...<br>

-1F: Below the writing?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#69">**</a>G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre below the writing.<br>
+1F: All right.<br>
+2G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: From where I left you, you have to go ... {fp|er} ... southwest, down {br|gent ly=gently} ... until you're underneath the ... {fp|er} noose, you're about five centimetres underneath the noose.<br>
-1F: I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not one centimetres away from the noose?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#70">**</a>G: No.  You're about ...<br>
+1F: Five centimetres.<br>
+2G: five centimetres down.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Reference the peak of the {fp|er} saloon ... Go four centimetres to your left ...<br>
-1F: From ... from where the {le|s} is?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#71">**</a>G: No.  {ab|Fr} ... Okay.  {ab|G} Look at the top of the {fp|er} ...<br>

<hr><p>
-2G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three centimetres straight across.<br>
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#72">**</a>G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.<br>
+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an angle ... and then go straight across ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {ph|S} ... From where you are.<br>
-1F: {ph|As=Is} that going to be the top of the pyramid?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#73">**</a>G: No, it would be right at the base.<br>
+1F: At the base.  I have a lemon grove right in the middle.<br>
+2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You've got to make sure you don't run over the lemon grove.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: And then you go back to the left so you're ... straight down from where you started, from the start.  You just ... You just ... go out to the right ... about half centimetre below the {le|b}, just swerve out to the right and then swing back.<br>
-1F: Okay.  Do you have a carpenter's cottage?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#74">**</a>G: No I don't.<br>
+1F: Okay.  I think that's what you're going around.  Anyways ...<br>
+2G: Yeah.  That will be it. And then, go down about another ... inch from there {ip|til=until} you're ... parallel to the top ... of the word {ci|ravine} ...<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: It's it's kind of {fp|er} ... I don't know what you'd call it.<br>
-1F: Do you have avalanche on yours?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#75">**</a>G: No I don't.  That's why I don't know what it looks like.<br>
+1F: How close does your route go to the side of the page?<br>
+2G: About five centimetres.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {ab|Ok} okay.  From the {le|p} ... you go out as far as the {le|v}. And you're about ... two centimetres straight down from the {le|v}. That's as far as you go out.<br>
-1F: Okay.  And I hook around the ...<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#76">**</a>G: {br|A and=And} then you ... And then ... you start to ... No, you don't go down to the concealed hideout yet.  You turn back to the left ... {fp|erm} ... {ab|unti} ...<br>
+1F: And I'm at the bottom of the avalanche now.<br>
+2G: until you're underneath the {le|g} ... about a centimetre down.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: {ph|goooooo=go} down ... until you're even with the {le|c} in {ci|camera shop} ...<br>
-1F: Am I making a loop?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#77">**</a>G: {fp|Er}, no.  You're just going straight down, almost.<br>
+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: It's a gentle loop.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Okay ...<br>
-1F: Over it?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#78">**</a>G: No.  {ph|nn-nn} ... This'll be a bit tricky.  {ab|G} {fp|uh} at the {br|w west=west} tip in the middle ...<br>
+1F: West tip in the middle?  Yeah.<br>
+2G: {ab|Oka} {ab|we} you have a mark, {le|x}, right?<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Okay, take your line and go ...<br>
-1F: Around it?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#79">**</a>G: No, you're going under it, just ... go under it closer to the pine grove ...<br>
+1F: Okay, so do I go straight across?<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Underneath the concealed hideout.<br>
-1F: No I'm not. ... I'm right {ab|be} ... I'm at the west ... I'm at the west ... I'm right at {le|c} in {ci|concealed}.<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#80">**</a>G: Okay.  No, scratch that.  Go up ... to where, you know, you first made the jog west.  You need to go around to the east.<br>
+1F: I need to go all the way around it?<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
<hr><p>
-2G: Okay.  You have something underneath pebbled shore?<br>
-1F: Yeah, I got to go in between it?<br>
<a href="transcript.1.html#81">**</a>G: No, go around it further to the left ...<br>
+1F: Right.<br>
+2G: Okay?  Now ... {ab|f} continue the loop around, and you see the flagship?<br>
