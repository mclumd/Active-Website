<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=83102>
Can we go, Steve?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=99102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=107701>
Okay.  {fp|Uh}, we're starting from above the missionary camp.

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=175901>
<bo id=o1a>
Yeah.  Got it.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=186102>
Do you have that?  Okay, what I want you to do is proceed ... west, to the
{ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} northwest corner of the missionary camp.
<eo id=o1a>

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=355501>
All right.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=369302>
Do you have anything right beside the missionary camp?

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=412501>
I have a banana tree off to the far west.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=467501>
Off to the far west?  How far?  Is it right beside the missionary camp
or there's a gap?

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=554302>
<bo id=o1b>
It's {ip|bout=about} {fp|uh} ... two ... two fingers from half page, west.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=661901>
Okay.  Okay what I want you to do is go along ... south, down past the
missionary camp ...
<eo id=o1b>

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=807102>
All right.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=815502>
{ab|S} So you're even with it, though.

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=852701>
All right.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=859302>
And proceed to the bottom of that ... I believe you have a banana
bush.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=932901>
<bo id=o1c>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=935102>
Or whatever.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=949501>
A {ab|bana} ...

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=949901>
I've got gorillas.  Do you have gorillas?
<eo id=o1c>

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=989901>
No I don't.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1001102>
Okay.  I I think gorillas and banana bush are sharing the same thing
here.  So proceed west to that ...

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1125701>
All right.

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1131701>
to the far southwest corner ...

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1182502>
<bo id=o1d>
All right.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1183302>
of your bananas ...
<eo id=o1d>

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1230302>
All right.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1239502>
And what I want you to do is ... now proceed north ...

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1315302>
All right.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1332102>
Do you have a rope bridge?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1355901>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1371501>
Okay, what I want you to do is curve up above, to the {fp|uh} west side
of the rope bridge ...

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1493302>
All right.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1513302>
Okay.  Now join to the other side of the rope bridge now, the east
part.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=1588901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=1595701>
Do you have anything beside that?

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=1641701>
{fp|Uh}, I have a waterfall to the far, far east.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=1686901>
Okay.  I want you to ... just go down a bit, go {fp|uh} ... south, down
past the the rope bridge, once you get off it ...

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=1872901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=1880502>
{ab|ju} just about one finger width.

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=1934102>
All right.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=1944701>
Okay?  And then proceed to the bottom ... the {fp|uh} southwest tip of the
waterfall ...

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2088501>
All right.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=2105901>
Okay.  Above the waterfall, on the west side, do you have some lost
steps?

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=2205502>
No I don't.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=2222302>
Do you have anything there?

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=2250302>
I don't have anything.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2272502>
<bo id=o1e>
Okay.

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2277102>
No.
<eo id=o1e>

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2294701>
What I want you to do is, start moving north ...

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2360502>
<bo id=o1f>
All right.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=2365302>
up the waterfall, up the west side of the waterfall ...
<eo id=o1f>

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=2429302>
All right.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=2443102>
about ... one finger length.  Do you have any fallen pillars?

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=2592901>
{fp|Uh} off to the {ab|f} west, I do.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=2650102>
{ab|A} Above the {ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} rope bridge, more or less?

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=2700901>
Yes.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=2712502>
Okay.  I want you to head for the northernmost {fp|uh}
... northeastern tip of the fallen pillars ...

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=2862701>
All right.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=2870702>
and then go below them.  And end up at the ... southwest tip.

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=2988702>
All right.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=2998702>
Okay.  Do you have anything ... {ab|l} let's see {fp|uh}, southwest of
that?

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=3083702>
{ab|Y} ...

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=3084102>
Of the fallen pillars?

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=3103102>
Yes I do, I have {fp|uh} flamingoes.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=3143302>
Okay, I don't have any flamingoes, so what I want you to do is curl
around the ... {fp|um} ... southeastern tip of the flamingoes ...

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=3313702>
All right.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=3339901>
and come up to the ... northwestern side.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=3421302>
<bo id=o1g>
All right.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=3440502>
Okay?  So you've gone almost all the way around them.
<eo id=o1g>

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=3489502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=3504302>
Okay, do you have any ancient ruins above that?

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=3556302>
I have a ruined city.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=3598102>
Ruined city?

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=3615702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=3624901>
{fp|Uh}, is that about one quarter down the page?

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=3709102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=3721102>
Okay, I want you to head for the ... {fp|um} ... let's see, northwestern
tip of that ...

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=3896901>
All right.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=3911102>
Okay?  And stop there.  Now, do you have any stones up above that?

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=4009302>
<event desc="clears his throat">
I have a rock fall off to the {fp|uh} ... north ... north northeast ... of
it.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=4141102>
To the north northeast?

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=4168702>
Yeah.  Approximately half a finger.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=4253502>
Okay.  {fp|Um}, what I want you to do is from the ancient ruins, just
head straight north.

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=4367702>
All right.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=4383102>
{ip|Til=Until} you're about {ab|th} ... half a finger down from the
top of the page.  Do you now have a white mountain off to the east?

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=4553702>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=4571302>
Okay.  Head for the north {ab|w} ... {fp|um} sorry, the southwest tip
of that mountain ...

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=4712901>
All right.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=4728502>
Okay?  Now proceed over top of the mountain and down to the ... {fp|um}
southeast side ...

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=4881502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=4898102>
Below this mountain, do you have the biggest furniture store?

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=4964102>
No.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=4973901>
Okay.  What I want you to do is go right under the mountain to just
right below it and head west ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=5097901>
<bo id=o1h>
All right.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=5101502>
under the mountain ...

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=5120502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=5123102>
You're ... You're going to pass in between the mountain and my biggest
furniture store ...
<eo id=o1h>

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=5202502>
All right.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=5210701>
And stop at the ... {ab|n} ... where you started touching the mountain but
dropped a bit.

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5327702>
{gg|Oh}, all right.

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=5340502>
Okay?  {fp|Um}, do you have any gazelles?

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=5406102>
{fp|Uh}, right to the {ab|d} south, I do.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=5455302>
To the south?

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=5469702>
<bo id=o1i>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=5474102>
Yeah.  Head south to the gazelles ...
<eo id=o1i>

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=5518901>
All right.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=5524502>
To the {fp|um} southwestern point of the gazelles ...

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=5601702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=5609901>
And then turn east ...

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=5644901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=5658502>
Go about half a finger east of the gazelles ...

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=5736302>
All right.

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=5749901>

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=46901>
Start!  Northwest of the diamond mine ... You've got the start marked, I
guess?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=176302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=205701>
You proceed ... southwest one finger, then southerly about three and
a half fingers, and pass eastward, on the southern border of
the diamond mine.

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=439102>
<bo id=o2a>
Okay, I don't ... okay, so eastward you want to go?

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=482701>
{gg|Oh}, do you have the diamond mine?
<eo id=o2a>

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=506701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=513302>
{gg|Oh}, okay.

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=522901>
Okay, from the start point you want me to go where?
Come {ph|chmm} south?

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=610102>
Yes.

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=618901>
Southwest, right?

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=643901>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=650701>
<unclear>
{ab|O}
</unclear>

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=651901>
Well you're really just doing a loop around the diamond mine ...

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=687502>
<bo id=o2b>
Okay.  Okay.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=696102>
counter-clockwise.
And you come off near the {le|e} of the word {ci|diamond mine},
heading east northeast towards ... the rift valley.
<eo id=o2b>

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=872901>
Okay, where do you want me to stop there?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=900501>
Well, you better stop about half way towards the word {ci|rift}.  Have
you got the wagon wheel marked in there?

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1012102>
No.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1030501>
Okay.  On your ... north side as you're heading towards the rift
valley, about half way from the word {ci|diamond mine} to the middle
of the rift valley ...

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=1190102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1197901>
there's a small wagon wheel on your north side.

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1254302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1258901>
So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed
... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that
wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading
<event desc="sounds of mike being knocked">
northerly or {ab|eith} even slightly west of north, going up the east
side of that wagon wheel.
<event desc="more sounds of mike">

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1602901>
Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1660102>
No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1720701>
You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1747302>
<bo id=o2c>
Towards ...
<editorial text="time stamped approx 1000 samples before true position">

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1748302>
middle of the {ab|ri} ...

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1760901>
Half way towards the rift valley.
<eo id=o2c>

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1790302>
{gg|Oh}, okay, half way.  All right.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1812701>
Yeah, the wagon wheel's half way, and you just ... make a left turn
around the far side or the east side of that wagon wheel.

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1934901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1935502>
So you're passing ... on the south side of this wagon wheel, and you
curve ... counter-clockwise to your left, as you go past it, so you're
actually heading north {ab|a} after you've passed the east side of the
wagon wheel.  It's just a big {le|s} you're doing.  And then, after
you're about a finger north of the wagon wheel, you cut back to the
right or the northeast, and then you go over the top of the rift
valley and right down the middle ...

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2423701>
<bo id=o2d>
Okay.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2425701>
of the rift valley heading south southwards right down the middle of
the rift valley.
<eo id=o2d>

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2495701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2504901>
So you go above it
<unclear>
and then it's
</unclear>
just like you're going for a swim in a pool.

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2557102>
So I I'm on the east side of the cactus now?

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2605302>
{fg|Er}, I don't have a cactus marked, but probably the cactus is,
what, southwest of the rift valley?

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=2715302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2723702>
Yeah, just ignore the cactus.  You're going due south
from the very centre of the rift valley ...

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2801502>
<bo id=o2e>
Okay.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=2802701>
about four fingers

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=2826302>
Okay.
<eo id=o2e>

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=2831701>
<bo id=o2f>
So you probably miss the cactus.  Then, after going about ... Have you
got rocks?  South of the rift valley?

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=2912901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2932102>
Okay.  About ...

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2932901>
I'm right above them, right now.
<eo id=o2f>

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2954302>
Yeah, okay, well sixty per cent of the way from the rift valley to the
rocks, you change your course and start heading ... southwest.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=3091302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=3104102>
So you miss the rocks by about one finger.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=3147502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=3175102>
And you then can proceed about four fingers past the rocks, so
that you're now {ab|w} ... {ab|s} west southwest of the rocks about
three or four fingers.  On your north side there should be a stone
creek.

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=3427701>
No.  Don't have it.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=3444102>
No stone creek.  Well it's there, and what you do ...

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=3499901>
<bo id=o2g>
{gg|Oh} Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!
<editorial text="Suddenly sees stone creek on his map">

<sfo samp=3514702>
{gg|Oh}.
<eo id=o2g>

It's {fp|er} ... south west from the rocks, way down.

{gg|Oh} {ab|tha} that'll be a different one.  Yeah,

<sfo samp=3654102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=3683502>
There's one stone creek ... due west of the rocks about four fingers.

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=3766302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=3774502>
{ab|An} {ab|An} And after heading south from the rift valley and then
heading southwesterly, you pass ... south of this stone creek which is
four fingers due west of the rocks ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=3956102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=3965102>
And then you ... curve to your right or to ... the north ... west
northwest, let's say.  Do you have the white water ... marked?

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=4148102>
I just have rapids.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=4168702>
Rapids.  It's probably the same.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=4195502>
<bo id=o2h>
{gg|Mmm}.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=4196302>
And this is about five or six fingers south of the diamond mine?
<eo id=o2h>

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=4264502>
Diamond mines?
Yeah.
<editorial text="first two words spoken to himself">

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=4307702>
Okay.  You pass ... {ab|ac} above the north side of {ab|tha}
those rapids.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=4413901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=4430102>
And you're heading ... west northwest at the time.  Do you have a
swamp marked?

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=4514502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=4524302>
Well, you're heading toward the swamp, but you don't go anyplace near
the swamp, you cut a sharp left, heading south west and then
south, around that white water, so you're actually passing
counter-clockwise around the white water or the rapids.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=4758901>
Okay.  So am I going to go east, again?

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=4801302>
<bo id=o2i>
No ...

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=4809502>
Past ... No?

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=4809702>
you're then going to go south.
<eo id=o2i>

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=4833502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=4857502>
After passing the rapids you head south about five or six fingers.

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=4944502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=4958502>
And then you ...

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=4976102>
I should be right beside a manned fort.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=5024702>
<unclear>
You know
</unclear>
I don't have the manned fort, but what I think you'll be doing is
passing west of the fort as you're heading southerly.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=5131302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=5137502>
And ... Do you have the stone slabs marked?

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=5192502>
Yeah.  They're {fp|uh} ...

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=5213701>
Northeast of the stone creek?  The lower stone creek?

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=5259901>
They're south ... Yeah!  {ab|Th} That's right.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=5274502>
And they're southwest of the outlaws' hideout?

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=5280302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=5294502>
Okay.  Well, heading toward the stone creek, the lower stone creek,
you curve to the east northeast, towards the outlaws' hideout.  So
you've ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=5363502>
So I should be going around the manned fort, then?

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=5378502>
Yes, you're probably going around the manned fort.

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=5601901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=5647702>
So you head right up to the south side of the outlaws' hideout and you
hang a right and you curve southwards then ...

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=5688302>
<bo id=o2j>
Okay.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=5690102>
having missed the south side of the outlaws' hideout by about a half finger.

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5812902>
So I ... I'm coming down to a gold mine.
<eo id=o2j>

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=5813701>
Yeah, you're probably going around the gold mine, then ...
{ip|cause=because} you head straight down the right-hand side of
the page, and around the noose, you're passing to the east of the
noose.

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=5859702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=5907902>
You then ... curve ... to the south west after you pass the east side of
the noose.

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=6086702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=6108102>
And go about three fingers.  And then, dead ahead of you is a little
swan pond, which is about one finger high and three fingers wide.

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=6214302>
I don't have that, I have a a saloon bar?

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=6230701>
You'll get there later.

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=6384901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=6429502>
It's about half way from the noose to the saloon bar.

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=6449502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=6456901>
And then you skirt the swan pond on the north side by dipping up
about half ... about one finger, then west about three fingers, and
then southwest about one finger.  So you just bypass this swan pond.

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=6504302>
<bo id=o2k>
Okay.

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=6525102>
And then you continue on to the south side of the saloon bar.
<eo id=o2k>

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=6786502>
South side, okay.

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=6788901>
And then you just have a slow arc {fp|uh} that takes you past the
saloon bar and up to the northeast, about three and a half fingers,
where you finish.

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=6853901>
So I should be coming ... down?
<event desc="experimenter interjects with 'two minutes to go'">
Okay, okay.

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=6879102>
{fg|Uh}, what you're doing is a big circle.  The centre of the circle
is the stone creek, and the the course you're following takes you
past the saloon bar on the south side, so it's just a big arc from the
swan pond, below the saloon bar and then up to the northwest to your
finish.

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=7043901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=7119102>
So you're about three inches from the ... southwest corner of the
saloon bar when you finish.  And you're heading northwest or or north
northwest at that point.

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=7378701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=7391302>
That's it.

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=7576302>
Done!

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=44102>
Okay, Richard.  We're going to start off.  Do you have an east lake in
the ... northeast corner?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=131302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=138102>
Of your map?  Right.  There's the ... Do you see the ...

Yeah.  The highest northwest point.

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=417302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=430701>
And then directly below that is the ... southwest corner ... of east

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=569102>
Straight down?  The southwest?  Yeah.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=600701>
Yeah.  Okay, well just ... just a little {br|pa ast=past} a a little

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=974701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=990901>
Okay.  Well, if you go directly south, {ph|fffar=far} down south, do
you have a {ph|ssssite=site} of ... {ph|ffforest=forest} fire?

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=1124701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=1216502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I got the start.

{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=1449901>
and go ... straight down south.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1501102>
<bo id=o3a>
So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1559901>
No.  No.  Go west.
<eo id=o3a>

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=1609302>
Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.

<u who=G n=21>

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1645302>
And then straight south?

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1661302>
Straight south.  Do you have a picnic site?  South of the site of the
forest fire?

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1728102>
No.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1748701>
Okay, then.  On the far right corner of your page do you have a farm
ground?  Farmyard, sorry.

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1864901>
Yeah.  On the far right, bottom right.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1904701>
Okay.  So then, at the bottom ... Okay.  As you've {ab|go} ... You've
gone straight down south from the forest fire site?

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=2049302>
Yeah, but I'm on basically the southwest corner of the forest fire.

<u who=G n=29>

Okay.  Go ... Keep going straight down {ip|til=until} {ab|yo} ...

<sfo samp=2286701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=33>

<sfo samp=2613702>
When do I head north?

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2653502>
{ph|Buz} So that you'll come up along the west side of the
adventure playground.

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2720901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  The the west side, okay.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=2765502>
Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit
{br|north east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ...

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=2909502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=2929302>

until you come to in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your

see that, way up there?  But you're still {ab|s} ...

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=3243702>
So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3308901>
No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line with

northeast until I hit the southwest corner?

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=3561102>
Okay.  You've gone straight up ... the west side of the adventure

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=3619901>
Yeah.  And then start curving northeast?

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=3648702>
Now {ab|s} ... Yes.

<eo id=o3f>

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=3877502>

{fp|er} east lake, that southwest corner'll be north of me?

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=3998102>

Yeah, I have a waterfall.  That's west ... {ab|di} just a little bit

Then curve up under the waterfall.  Go straight up the ... west side
of the waterfall.  The rock there in the waterfall.

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=5580701>

<sfo samp=6679901>
Further out?  How high, though?
<eo id=o4r>

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=6737502>
{fg|Oh}, not ... not high.  Just ... Make the curve
about the same size as the abandoned truck, actually.

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=6881702>
<bo id=o4s>
So, okay, so basically half ...

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=6909102>
From the old temple, from the second ring, you're going to make a
curve the size of the abandoned truck ...
<eo id=o4s>

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=7002302>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=129>

<sfo samp=7087302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=131>
<sfo samp=7094901>

<eo id=o4t>

<u who=F n=134>
<sfo samp=7240501>
Okay, so you want me to curve around it and then go ... Do I go ...
curve towards the white mountain?

<u who=G n=135>
<sfo samp=7331901>
Yeah.  You made a big curve and then you're going to go on an angle of
probably ...
<event desc="Experimenter says `Two more minutes, guys.'">
{ab|north} northeast ...

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=7465901>
<bo id=o4u>
Northeast, okay.

<u who=G n=137>
<sfo samp=7471502>

<u who=F n=138>
<sfo samp=7508302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, how {ab|fa} ... Okay yeah, I go up the face of the west
side?
<eo id=o4u>

<u who=G n=139>
<sfo samp=7564102>
Okay, and then go ... As you're going up the {ab|w} ... the west face,
go straight up ... Do you have a pyramid at the top of your page?

<u who=F n=140>
<sfo samp=7722902>
I've got a pyramid at the {ab|to} ... the {br|north east=northeast}

{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=143>
<sfo samp=7928701>
until you're in line with the bottom of the pyramid, and then head
east ... Right?

<u who=F n=144>
<sfo samp=8064502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=145>
<sfo samp=8074502>
Curve up all the way up and around right down underneath the bottom of
the pyramid ...

<u who=F n=146>
<sfo samp=8164302>
<bo id=o4v>
So I curve ... {ab|bel} ...

<u who=G n=147>
<sfo samp=8184102>
Curve all the way around the pyramid, go right around it ...

<u who=F n=148>
<sfo samp=8225302>
Below?

<u who=G n=149>
<sfo samp=8225501>

<eo id=o4v>

<u who=F n=150>
<sfo samp=8264102>
Okay, below the pyramid or above it?

<u who=G n=151>

<u who=G n=163>
<sfo samp=8662901>
come ... curve around the bottom of the remote village ...

<u who=F n=164>
<sfo samp=8721502>
Curve around the bottom?  Or ...

<u who=G n=165>
<sfo samp=8745302>
Yeah.  Come all the way down south and curve around the bottom of the

<sfo samp=8848701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<sfo samp=8856701>
and just past the remote village, you finish.

<u who=F n=168>

Okay, so I'm going to curve ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, so, basically, come

<u who=G n=169>
<sfo samp=9001102>
Right.

<u who=F n=170>
<sfo samp=9027302>

Are you ready, steve?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=73302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=94302>
Okay, our starting point is at the site of the forest fire.

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=164302>
Yeah, got it.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=187501>
Okay.  What you're going to do is you're going to move to the west
side of the forest fire.

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=280102>
<bo id=o5a>
All right.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=282102>
And start moving south.  Down.  Do you have a picnic site just below
the forest fire?
<eo id=o5a>

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=389901>
<bo id=o5b>
I have a ... No I don't.  I have an adventure playground, right to the

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=475901>
Okay, okay.  Have that too.
<eo id=o5b>

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=506901>
{gg|Oh}.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=510701>
Right below the forest fire, I have a picnic site.  So what you're
going to do is you're going to head, {fp|uh} sorry, south, down ... around
the west side of my picnic site ... and start east and then come up
between that and the adventure playground.  So I want you to end up on
the ... northwest corner of the adventure playground.

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=989501>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, so I go on the east side of ... or I go on the west side
of the forest fire?

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=1060102>
<bo id=o5c>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=1068701>
All right.
<eo id=o5c>

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=1068901>
<bo id=o5d>
Straight down.  Imagine that there is a picnic site just below there.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=1139102>
Yeah, all right.
<eo id=o5d>

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=1166302>
Okay?  {ab|S} So you're going to go around that.  And you're going
to end up at the {fp|uh} ... {ab|n} northwest corner of the playground.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1354901>
All right, I'm there.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1377502>

Yeah.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1395901>
Now what I want you to do is ... for ... two finger lengths, I want you to
head east.

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1592502>

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1679302>
I have a ... privately owned field.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1725901>
Okay, I don't have that.  What you're going to do is you're going to
go underneath that field ...

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1815701>
All right.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1849502>
And you're going to stop at the {fp|uh}, let's see {fp|uh},
southeastern tip of that ...

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1994302>
All right.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=2007701>
Okay?  Now, do you have a {ph|go} ... granite quarry, above that?

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=2081901>
{fp|Uh}, directly to the north I do, yes.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2123901>
Okay.  Now what I want you to do is from that {fp|um} ... southeastern
tip, is go up to the ... {ab|g} go north to the northeastern tip of the
granite quarry.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2393502>
All right.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2407901>
Okay?

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2426502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2438302>
Now what you're going to do is you're going to go over top of the
quarry, and end up on the ... northwestern tip.

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2587901>
<bo id=o5f>
All right, I'm there.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2598702>
Okay?  Now to the {fp|uh} ... southwest, do you have a {fp|uh} train
crossing?

I have nothing, to the southwest.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2815901>
Okay, I ... {fp|Uh}, do you have a waterfall?

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2861302>
I have a waterfall to the {br|ea east=east} ... or to the west, yes.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=2914702>
Okay.  I want you to {fp|um} ... From your point

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3178502>
And head to {ph|thee=the} ... southwest corner of the waterfall.

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=3310302>
All right.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=3323702>
Okay?

<u who=F n=50>

<sfo samp=3620901>
All right.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=3636302>
Do you have anything to the {fp|uh} northeast there?

A public {ph|totepath=footpath} or something like that.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=3807302>
Okay.  I don't have anything there.  So what I want you to do is head
directly north from that {fp|um} ... from {ph|thee=the} ... {fp|uh}
northeastern tip of the waterfall ...
<eo id=o5h>

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=4014901>

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5271901>
All right.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5301502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}?  Now you're going to head east ...

Okay.
<event desc="sighs">
Well, {fp|ehm}, since it's easy to draw lines where they're not
going to have to be, shortly thereafter, when you discover there's
something there that you didn't know about, I'm going to mention a few
of the obstacles that we're going to ... be going around and you
can mark them in ahead of time and ... and then we'll draw the
line.  {fp|Uh}, do you have a footbridge in about {fp|uh} five fingers
northwest of the falls?

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=739501>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=755102>
Do you have the poisoned stream immediately east of the footbridge?

No.

<u who=G n=9>

Okay.  About one finger-width away from the footbridge, and with the

{ab|d} in a southerly direction there's going to be a poisoned
stream.  It's just an obstacle that we're going to have to go around.

<sfo samp=1198701>
No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=1229701>
That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=1304302>
Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at one

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=1407102>

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1848701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1853701>

<sfo samp=2053102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=2069302>
Do you have the cobbled street, south of the pyramid?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=2139502>
{fp|Uh}, no.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=2159102>
Okay.

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=2166302>
South of the pyramid, there's a remote village.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2212701>
All right.  In between the pyramid and the remote village, about {fp|uh} ...
forty per cent of the way down from the pyramid to the remote
village, and directly above the remote village in terms of east-west,
there's a cobbled street with a street lamp on it.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2527701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2538102>
We're going to be jogging around that later.

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2577901>
All right.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2596102>
And that's about all you need to to watch out for.  Okay, we start
... above the crest falls, go west ... about a finger and a half, and
then curve southwards so we're just going around the north west
{fp|uh} margin of the crest falls heading {br|south westerly=southwesterly} ...

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2937302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2961502>
Then, after we get even with the base of crest falls, we start heading
westerly, and proceed westerly ... about {ph|ssssix=six} or eight fingers,
so that we're about two-thirds or three-quarters of the way towards
the edge of the map.

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=3265502>
<bo id=o6c>
Okay.  So I should be ...

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=3273102>
Then we arc ...
<eo id=o6c>

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=3292901>
<bo id=o6d>
I should be coming right under the banana tree, then?

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=3327102>
Right.  Okay, that's fine.  And then we arc ... We'll probably be
going west of the banana tree and then north ...
<eo id=o6d>

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=3435302>
<bo id=o6e>
Okay.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=3437502>
We arc up to the north, a big right curve.  Go north, towards the
baboon hill ...
<eo id=o6e>

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=3559302>
Okay.  West side of the {ph|boom} ... baboon hill?

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3611502>
{fp|Uh} {ab|n} ... We don't get that far.

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=3636701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=3642102>
<event desc="clears his throat">
We then continue arcing to the right, and head right on to that
footbridge heading easterly, right into the west ... end of the
footbridge and go right across the footbridge.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=3853702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=3889901>
{ab|W} ... As soon as we get across the footbridge we have to curve
immediately southwards to avoid that poisoned stream.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=4022502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=4041901>
We go about two fingers south, and then we head immediately due
east, passing on the south side of the poisoned stream.

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=4217702>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading right to the old temple now.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=4249102>
{ab|R} ... That's correct.  We now arc to the left, a left turn going
north, and we're heading due north as we pass the west side of the old
temple, very close to the old temple as we head due north.

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=4495102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=4516502>
We go about ... three {ab|f} or four fingers from the base of the old
temple, that's about two fingers above the ... the north end of the
old temple, and then we alter course to the north west, travel about
three or four {ph|ff} ...

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=4773502>
So, I'm going to be going up slate mountain, then?

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=4823502>
{fp|Uh}, you probably have a mountain in there.

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=4866302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=4875102>
So we're probably going on the east and the northeast sides of
slate {br|mou ntain=mountain}.

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=4959702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=4996502>
Then we get above the top of slate mountain ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=5055102>
<bo id=o6f>
I should be ...

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=5055901>
We head ...

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=5072502>
right below remote village.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=5091102>
Remote village.  Correct.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=5108502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=5114502>
Okay, at that point we change course and head south west and pass
... east to west along the south side of the abandoned truck.
<eo id=o6f>

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=5301502>
<bo id=o6g>
Okay.  So I should be, like, right above the baboons or whatever?

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=5394302>
That's correct.
<eo id=o6g>

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=5408302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=5415701>
About half a finger west of the southwest corner of the abandoned
truck, you you turn south, and you now dip south, then west,
and then north, right around the baboon hill.

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5636302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5673302>
And after you've finished passing the baboon hill on the west heading
north, you'll go east ... or sorry, north northeast, and go right up to
the west face of white mountain.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5897902>
Okay.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5915701>
And you {ab|par} ... go parallel to the west face of white mountain about
a half a finger's ... width away from white mountain.  And when you
get to the peak of white mountain, you then head due north.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=6145302>
So I'm going right up to lemon
<sic>
grew?
</sic>


<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=6199901>
I would suppose so.

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=6227302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=6242102>
And when you get ... even with the base of the pyramid, in a
north-southerly orientation, you make a ... sharp ... right ... turn,
heading eastwards, towards the pyramid, but you're about one quarter
of the way up the height of the pyramid at that point, not right at
the base, but about one quarter of the way up.  And you head ...

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=6652102>
<bo id=o6h>
Okay.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=6657502>
east towards the pyramid, and when you get to the west face of the
pyramid, you {ab|g} ... head north east and do the same thing that you
did with the other mountains.  You go up to the peak of the pyramid
and then down, southeast along the east face.  Of the pyramid.
<eo id=o6h>

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=6973701>
So I'm just going up and around it?

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=7004302>
Right, yeah.  You're just missing it by a half finger's width.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=7059102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=7083502>
Okay.  When you get to the east side of the pyramid you swing
... to the south west, and then the west, and cross underneath the
pyramid from east to west.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=7362102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=7374702>
And when you get to the ...

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=7385302>
<bo id=o6i>
So I'm in between the pyramid and ...

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=7414901>
and the cobbled street.
<eo id=o6i>

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=7434901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=7448102>
Okay, when you get to the {ab|m} line of the west side of the
pyramid, you then head south southwest, and you pass on the west
side of the cobbled street, the west side of the remote village, and
then swing a ... a left turn or ... towards the east, and cross
across west to east, on the south side of the remote village ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=7843701>
<bo id=o6j>
So I'm coming ...

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=7848901>
to your finish ... line, and the finish mark is about one finger east
of the {le|e} of {ci|remote village}, the final {le|e} of {ci|village},
and about half a finger south of that {le|e}.
<eo id=o6j>

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=8048502>
Where is it?  Where's the finish point?

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=8074702>
{fp|Uh}, half a finger south of the last {le|e} of village, and about
one finger-width east of it.

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=8191901>
Okay.  Okay.
<editorial text="First OKAY is very quiet, second is loud">

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=8292502>
That's it!

<sfo samp=316302>
Okay.  So that's where we're going to.  Okay.  This is how I want you

<sfo samp=555502>
<bo id=o7a>

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=584901>
I have a carpenter's cottage.
<eo id=o7a>
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=618901>
Okay.  What I want you to do is head down the ... western side of the

<sfo samp=741701>
<bo id=o7b>
Yeah.

All right.

Do you have a ravine?

<sfo samp=1006502>
Yeah.

No I don't.

Yes I do.

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2313502>
All right.

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=2601502>
All right.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2618302>
Okay.  Do you have a boathouse right there?

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2663502>
Directly south I do.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2703102>
Directly south?

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2721302>
Directly south of the hideout.

<sfo samp=3113302>
All right.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=3123502>
That should be parallel to the concealed hideout.  Now what I want you

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=511302>
Okay.  Where is it located?

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=535302>
It's about {fp|uh} ... There'd be a gap of about {fp|uh} two and a
half
<event desc="clears throat">
to three fingers' breadths.  Otherwise it looks the same, same
orientation, but it's south of the camera shop.

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=746302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=748501>
About two and a half fingers' width of space between the two.

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=814501>
Okay.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=855502>
Have you got the allotments, to the east southeast of the camera
shop?

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=921701>
Yeah.  That would sort of be in the middle of the van and the camera
shop, wouldn't it?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=986901>
{gg|Mmm}?

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=997302>
<bo id=o8c>
That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1036302>
{fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van
is due south of the camera shop.
<eo id=o8c>

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=1110701>
Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the
middle of them.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1183102>
Bring the van over?

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1202102>
<bo id=o8d>
No.  The {fp|uh}
<sic>
alloitments
</sic>
in between the camera shop and the van?

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1270302>
{gg|Oh}!  Well, yeah, these allotments are at least a finger's breadth
away from the camera shop and about a finger's breadth below it.
The parked van's about three fingers below it.
<eo id=o8d>

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1480102>
Okay, all right.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1497701>
Due south.  So I might as well just get started.  You start there, go
to the west, or south west about one finger's width, and then veer
{ab|st} straight south, passing down the west side of the camera shop,
as you go south.

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1820901>
Okay, am I going to pass the van?

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1849302>
Go right down to the front of the van and underneath it, and cross
from west to east under the south side of the parked van.

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1975901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=2025901>
Then you swing north.  As soon as you get to the back end of the van
you go due north, so you're heading up just eastwards of the camera
shop but westwards of the allotments on the west side of the
allotments.  And you just skirt the allotments, and then you
immediately alter course, to the east northeast.  So you're going to
pass on the northerly side of the allotments as you head east
northeast.

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=2488102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=2509701>
You go about two thirds the width of the page and then make a sharp
northerly turn.  Then you're going due north.  You've probably got
something marked there that you're making a corner turn around.

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=2780901>
What is that?  The abandoned ...

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2819901>
<bo id=o8e>
Doesn't really matter, but ...

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2826901>
monastery?
<eo id=o8e>

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2858302>
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">
There's probably some ... object.  Have you got an abandoned monastery?

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2917701>
Yeah.  So, am am I going up towards there?

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2952102>
<bo id=o8f>
You will be going up to it, and you'll be passing over the north side
of the abandoned monastery
<event desc="clears throat">
from east ...

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=3046302>
Okay, so I have ... I have to curve ... I have to go up with the
lake lake, then, right?
<eo id=o8f>

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=3130302>
<bo id=o8g>
{fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand side
or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something in
between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five fingers'
breadth ...

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=3368102>
Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=3410102>
{fg|Oh}.  No.
<event desc="sound of mike being bumped">
You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't have west lake.
<eo id=o8g>

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=3462901>
Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=3550702>
Okay.  Well ...

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=3569702>
<bo id=o8h>
And it's about ...

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=3575302>
It'll be inside the big loop that you're making.
<eo id=o8h>
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=3616502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3641901>
But you just go a straight line, east northeast from the north west
corner of the allotments.  Take it about eight fingers' breadth
and that's where you then go due north to meet the {ab|r} east
side of the abandoned monastery.

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=3895102>
Okay.  D'you have a flight museum?

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=3931102>
No.
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=3944302>
No, okay.  So I'm right at the {fp|uh} southeast corner ...

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=4057302>
of the abandoned monastery.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=4081102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=4091901>
Okay, now you just make a ... a crescent-shaped arc,
<event desc="sounds of mike being bumped">
over top of the abandoned monastery, you're heading northwest, then
west, then southwest, just to go right around the abandoned monastery,
and you're on, then {ph|on-nn=on} the west southwest corner of the
abandoned monastery ...

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=4340502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=4350102>
having passed it on the north side of it.  Now there's ... Do you
have {ph|aaa=a} youth hostel, south of the parked van at the top?

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=4488901>
{fp|Uh}, no.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=4519901>
{fp|Uh}, an alpine garden?

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=4552102>
Yeah, that's further down, though.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=4585701>
Okay.

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=4594502>
It's just up to the {fp|uh} northwest of the abandoned monastery.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=4686702>
Right.  Well, northeast of the alpine garden, and south of the parked
van at the top, about equidistant between those two objects, is a
youth hostel.

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=4880901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=4891502>
Might as well just throw it in, just a little house.

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=4928901>
D'you have a ... a {ph|levver} crossing?
<unclear>
thing's this?
</unclear>
level crossing?

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=5013702>
Level crossing?  Like railroad?

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=5046302>
Yeah.  Well, it's not a railroad.  It's ... looks like a ... a gate,
sort of.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=5135502>
{fg|Oh}.  Well, we don't have that one here.  {fp|Uh} ...

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=5171502>
It's directly below the east lake.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=5219901>
{gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you
... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to
the point where you head north ...

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=5332502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=5346901>
to the abandoned monastery, anyway.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=5379102>
<bo id=o8i>
Just to confirm something.  Do ...

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=5400302>
Sure.

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5400901>
Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
<eo id=o8i>

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5455302>
No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5493502>
Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5545502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5552502>
<bo id=o8j>
Okay.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5554302>
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">
{ab|Y} ... Up the west side, and then across to north side.

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=5594901>
All right.  Okay, okay.
<eo id=o8j>

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=5630701>
<bo id=o8k>
Anyway, the {fp|uh} ... After leaving the abandoned monastery you're
heading south west for just a half finger, and then you start
curving ... slowly ... to the right, clockwise
<event desc="clears throat">
so you're probably avoiding something, and then you go due north,
right up the west side of the alpine garden.  So that's how you get
from the abandoned monastery to the alpine garden.  Then we're ...

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=6014102>
So I'm curving around the alpine garden?
<eo id=o8k>

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=6059102>
Right.

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=6070302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=6074102>
And when you get to the northwest corner of the alpine garden, you
make a ... a {ph|ssssudden=sudden} change from northerly to easterly.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=6205501>
<bo id=o8l>
Okay.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=6206102>
That's at a right angle turn to the right.
<eo id=o8l>

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=6236901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=6261702>
Then you get near the ... easterly part of alpine garden on the north
border ...

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=6346702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=6348901>
And you suddenly make a left-hand turn and veer {fp|uh} fairly
sharply.  Go due north then to avoid the {fp|uh} youth hostel and to
pass on the west side of the youth hostel as you go from south to
north.

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=6578102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=6605901>
Then when you get to the northwest corner of the youth hostel, you
make another fairly sharp right turn, and are then heading east
across the northerly border of the youth hostel.

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=6808701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=6829901>
When you get to the northeast corner of the youth hostel, you
make an {fp|uh} a fairly abrupt course alteration, and then head
south east.

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=6997302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=7012502>
And you'll be passing about eight finger-widths.  And you'll be
just missing the previous track, when you went up past the
{ab|abandon} ...
<event desc="clears throat">
excuse me ... abandoned monastery by about one finger-width.

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=7236102>
So, d'you ... Am I going right for a telephone box?

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=7279901>
<bo id=o8m>
Yeah.  You, you ...

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=7292502>
Okay.
<eo id=o8m>

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=7305302>
<bo id=o8n>
You're heading for the {le|t} of {ci|telephone} and you're ... then
you're going to go ...

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=7346102>
<unclear>
All right.  There.
</unclear>
<eo id=o8n>

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=7382502>
west to east across the bottom of the word {ci|telephone box}.

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=7470501>
Okay.

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=7503502>
And then, when you get past the {le|x} you go due north, about two
and a half finger-widths ...

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=7623901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=7644901>
<bo id=o8o>
{gg|Ah} ... Do you have ...

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=7652502>
So I should be just at the top of the telephone?
<eo id=o8o>

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=7695901>
Yeah.
<event desc="clears throat">

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=7707702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=7714102>
<bo id=o8p>
But on the northeast corner of it, sort of.

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=7739302>
yeah, yeah.
<eo id=o8p>

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=7749901>
Do you have a thatched mud hut, south of east lake?

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=7804302>
{fp|Uh}, no.  I have a level ... level crossing.

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=7890302>
<bo id=o8q>
Okay.

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=7901502>
So I guess that would be it.
<eo id=o8q>

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=7905901>
<bo id=o8r>
Well, if you take the ... south east corner of east lake, about one
and a half finger-widths south of it, just put a little hut.  That's
the thatched mud hut.

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=8028901>
Yeah, that's where the ... That's ... That's exactly where the {fp|uh}
level crossing is.
<eo id=o8r>

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=8082702>
{gg|Oh}, okay.  Where ... {ab|Th} {ab|Th} This is the east ... southeast
corner of east lake.  Okay.  Anyway, so you then ... Leaving the
northeast corner of the telephone box, you go {ip|bout=about} one
and a half fingers north west, and start arcing to the north,
{ip|til=until} you're going due north, right up, underneath
the ... the word {ci|east lake}, you're heading towards the lake.

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=8505501>
Okay.

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=8509501>
And you're almost in the middle of it.

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=8541302>
Yeah.  Right there.

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=8550501>
And you're ... you're just avoiding this thatched mud hut ...

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=8599102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=8605901>
by making that little curve to the west, northwest and then
north.

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=8684102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=8695302>
When you get about a ... a half a finger's breadth from east lake, you
turn left, proceed on until you're about a half ... one finger's
breadth past the {fp|uh} corner there, on the {ab|l} south west corner
and you put your {le|x}.

<u who=F n=128>

<bo id=o8s>
That's where ...

{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=28>
<sfo samp=1347901>
you're going to head west.

<u who=F n=29>
<sfo samp=1389901>
Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve
... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?

<u who=G n=30>
<sfo samp=1488302>
Right.

<u who=F n=31>
<sfo samp=1502701>
And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?

<u who=G n=32>
<sfo samp=1557102>
<bo id=o9d>
No.
<event desc="sniffs">
In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...

<u who=F n=33>
<sfo samp=1617701>
Okay.
<eo id=o9d>

<u who=G n=34>
<sfo samp=1645302>
go west.

<u who=F n=35>
<sfo samp=1658501>
Okay.  I got it.

<u who=G n=36>
<sfo samp=1681501>
Okay?  And then ...
<event desc="sniffs">
You see the top of the ravine?

<u who=F n=37>
<sfo samp=1755502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=38>
<sfo samp=1765701>
<bo id=o9e>
Okay?
Don't go right up along the side, just curve up gradually, up around,
and over the top of the {ph|vravine=ravine} ... and {ab|abo} ...

<u who=F n=39>
<sfo samp=1889102>
Okay.  Hang on a second here.
<event desc="a short pause">
Okay.  From the {ab|bur} ... From {ph|theee=the} the the {le|b} of the
{ab|bur} or from the {le|u} of the {ci|burnt forest} I was supposed to
curve?  And then from {ab|wh} there, where do I go?  From the {le|u} of
{ci|burnt forest}?
<eo id=o9e>

<u who=G n=40>
<sfo samp=2115102>
Okay.  Just make a little curve ... eastward, and then back out,
westward, {ab|abou} at the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest}.  Okay?  Just
curve in a little bit ...

<u who=F n=41>
<sfo samp=2295901>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=42>
<sfo samp=2303102>
Then {ab|gradual} gradually come out.  And then stop ... when you're
in line ... with the bottom of the ravine ... and ... {ab|tha} that
point should also be in line with the north point of {ci|start}.
So that point right there.
<editorial text="the Giver's pronunciation of START lacks any clear final t">

<u who=F n=43>
<sfo samp=2605702>

<u who=G n=44>

In line with the start.
<editorial text="the Giver's pronunciation of START lacks any clear final t">

Yeah, with the start point.  You should be in line, like they should

<u who=F n=47>
<sfo samp=2785702>
I ... No, I don't have that.

<u who=G n=48>
<sfo samp=2836502>
{ab|Wha} ... What do {ab|y} ... No.  Like, the ... Just {ph|ii} with
the word {ci|start} ...

<u who=F n=49>
<sfo samp=2912102>
Yeah?

<u who=G n=50>
<sfo samp=2914502>
It should be in the ... When you come out of your curve and stop ...

<u who=F n=51>
<sfo samp=2991901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=52>
<sfo samp=3002701>
you should stop so that you're in {ab|l} ... directly underneath
... the {le|a} in {ci|start}.

<u who=F n=53>
<sfo samp=3119901>
<bo id=o9f>
{gg|Oh} okay.  So {ab|basic} ...

<u who=G n=54>
<sfo samp=3132502>
Just ... In line with it.
<eo id=o9f>

<u who=F n=55>
<sfo samp=3162901>
Okay.  So, from the ravine I'm going west ... until I'm on with start?

<u who=G n=56>
<sfo samp=3257302>
No, no, no.  From the burnt forest ...

<u who=F n=57>
<sfo samp=3319901>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=58>
<sfo samp=3330102>
you make your little curve ...

<u who=F n=59>
<sfo samp=3360302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=60>
<sfo samp=3374302>
inward towards the east.

<u who=F n=61>
<sfo samp=3400302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=62>
<sfo samp=3408502>
Then you go back out west ...

<u who=F n=63>
<sfo samp=3451302>
Okay.  How far do I {ab|cur} ... Like, how far do I make this curve?

<u who=G n=64>
<sfo samp=3509702>
Just curve in a little bit, just in towards the {le|b}.  That's it.

<u who=F n=65>
<sfo samp=3590502>
<bo id=o9g>
Just in towards the {le|b}.  So, curve ... to the right?
<event desc="a short pause here">
Is that what you're saying?

<u who=G n=66>
<sfo samp=3689102>
You'll be curving ... Curve in towards ... like, the ravine in a way,
you know what I mean?
<eo id=o9g>

<u who=F n=67>
<sfo samp=3818901>
Not really.
<editorial text="laughing">

<u who=G n=68>
<sfo samp=3844702>
Okay, then.  This is ... Do you have anything next to the burnt forest
there or anything?

<u who=F n=69>
<sfo samp=3913302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Below the burnt forest I have carpenter's cottage, and
that is west of the ravine.

<u who=G n=70>
<sfo samp=4012901>
<bo id=o9h>
West?  Okay.

<u who=F n=71>
<sfo samp=4035102>
It's west of the ravine and it's south of burnt forest.
<eo id=o9h>

<u who=G n=72>
<sfo samp=4087901>
Okay.  Well just ... Go right around that then.  Go right around ...

<u who=F n=73>
<sfo samp=4149702>
Okay.  I'm just going around it.

<u who=G n=74>
<sfo samp=4184901>
{ab|Ye} ... Just ... Yeah.  {ab|Tha} that's why I have this space.  Go
around it ...

<u who=F n=75>
<sfo samp=4246502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=76>
<sfo samp=4256302>
And then go due east towards the ravine ... right in line with the
bottom of the ravine ...

<u who=F n=77>
<sfo samp=4344102>
Okay.  So go ... east towards the ravine then?

<u who=G n=78>
<sfo samp=4393901>
Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then
you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...

<u who=F n=79>
<sfo samp=4477502>
Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?

<u who=G n=80>
<sfo samp=4525701>
No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.

<u who=F n=81>
<sfo samp=4603102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=82>
<sfo samp=4616102>
Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of the
ravine ...

<u who=F n=83>
<sfo samp=4700901>
Yeah?

<u who=G n=84>
<sfo samp=4709901>
just start ... curve upwards, up north ...

<u who=F n=85>
<sfo samp=4757901>
Curve north then?

<u who=G n=86>
<sfo samp=4783702>
Yeah.  That's how ... {ab|wha} what it was before ...
Then when you get the top of the ravine, curve so that you're going
east then again ... You've curved up and gone north.  Now you've
curved and going east ...

<u who=F n=87>
<sfo samp=4990701>
Okay.  So let me get this thing straight here.  From the start I go
{ph|ssssou} I go south how far?

<u who=G n=88>
<sfo samp=5080302>
South, so that you're in line with the word ... so that you're in line
with the bottom of the ravine.  How about that?

<u who=F n=89>
<sfo samp=5218502>
<bo id=o9i>
Okay.  That's ...

<u who=G n=90>
<sfo samp=5227702>
Can you do that? ...

<u who=F n=91>
<sfo samp=5234702>
Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve
over the top of this carpenter's ...
<eo id=o9i>

<u who=G n=92>
<sfo samp=5305502>
No, no, no.

<u who=F n=93>
<sfo samp=5321702>
Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...

<u who=G n=94>
<sfo samp=5367302>
<bo id=o9j>
Right.  Then go east ...

<u who=F n=95>
<sfo samp=5384102>
and then curve ... east, okay.
<eo id=o9j>

<u who=G n=96>
<sfo samp=5421302>
<bo id=o9k>
and then curve up north ...

<u who=F n=97>
<sfo samp=5441102>
North, okay.  Got it.
<eo id=o9k>

<u who=G n=98>
<sfo samp=5470302>
and then curve over top of the ravine ...

<u who=F n=99>
<sfo samp=5502302>
Okay.  Got it.

<u who=G n=100>
<sfo samp=5517902>
and come around ... Do you have a remote village above the ravine?

<u who=F n=101>
<sfo samp=5569502>
No.

<u who=G n=102>
<sfo samp=5577502>
Okay.  Well then, just curve over the top of the ravine.  Do you have
pine grove there?

<u who=F n=103>
<sfo samp=5651901>
<bo id=o9l>
Yes.  I have pine grove to the {ab|wes} ... east.

<u who=G n=104>
<sfo samp=5678302>
Okay.  As you come over the top of the ravine, curve down along the
west side of the pine grove ...
<eo id=o9l>

<u who=F n=105>
<sfo samp=5822302>
<bo id=o9m>
Curve down along the west side of the pine grove?  Okay.

<u who=G n=106>
<sfo samp=5856702>
Yeah.  And then ... Do you have anything right below the pine grove or
anything?
<eo id=o9m>

<u who=F n=107>
<sfo samp=5944901>
{fp|Er}, southeast of it I have the avalanche.

<u who=G n=108>
<sfo samp=6002902>
Okay.  Well I don't have that, so what you're going to do is curve
around to the east of that ...

<u who=F n=109>
<sfo samp=6094901>
The east of where?

<u who=G n=110>
<sfo samp=6132702>
Of your avalanche.  That ... {ab|s} ...

<u who=F n=111>
<sfo samp=6166702>
So, how far south do I go, once I hit the west side of pine grove?

<u who=G n=112>
<sfo samp=6245501>
You just go to the bottom of pine grove ...

<u who=F n=113>
<sfo samp=6282102>
To the bottom of pine grove.  Okay.

<u who=G n=114>
<sfo samp=6304102>
<bo id=o9n>
Okay.  And then curve around it.  You'll have to curve around it,
won't you?  {ab|Ma} ...

<u who=F n=115>
<sfo samp=6356502>
Curve around the bottom?  Of pine grove?
<eo id=o9n>

<u who=G n=116>
<sfo samp=6415501>
<bo id=o9o>
Okay.  You've come ... south, along ... down to the the {le|p} in
{ci|pine grove}, okay?

<u who=F n=117>
<sfo samp=6522702>
Yeah.
<eo id=o9o>

<u who=G n=118>
<sfo samp=6540302>
Okay?  Now make a little curve ...

<u who=F n=119>
<sfo samp=6583901>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=120>
<sfo samp=6594901>
starting at the {le|p} in {ci|pine} ...

<u who=F n=121>
<sfo samp=6624102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=122>
<sfo samp=6639102>
to the end of {ci|grove}.  Just make a little curve all the way
out ...

<u who=F n=123>
<sfo samp=6700501>
Okay.

<u who=G n=124>
<sfo samp=6723701>
So you're making like a little half moon kind of ...

<u who=F n=125>
<sfo samp=6760701>
Yeah.  Got it.

<u who=G n=126>
<sfo samp=6778502>
And then make another one ...

<u who=F n=127>
<sfo samp=6802302>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=128>
<sfo samp=6808701>
{ph|Zz} ... {ip|Cause=Because} your ... This this ... half moon'll be
pointing almost, like, southwest ... Right?

<u who=F n=129>
<sfo samp=6932902>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=G n=130>
<sfo samp=6945102>
Okay.  Now make another one so that you're going back out east.  Do
you have a ... concealed hideout there?

<u who=F n=131>
<sfo samp=7040102>
Yes, I have a concealed hideout.

<u who=G n=132>
<sfo samp=7061702>
Okay.  Well then, just ... Go in line.  Go go right around the
concealed hideout ...

<u who=F n=133>
<sfo samp=7166702>
Around where?

<u who=G n=134>
<sfo samp=7183102>
Circle right around the {ab|l} ... out the {ab|we} ... the east side,
sorry, the east side of the concealed hideout ...

<u who=F n=135>
<sfo samp=7279502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, where should I be from this curve?

<u who=G n=136>
<sfo samp=7332702>
<bo id=o9p>
Just make a little curve.  I don't have anything unless you do.
{ab|I} It's only you ...

<u who=F n=137>
<sfo samp=7391702>
I've got a avalanche above the {ab|h} ... concealed hideout.

<u who=G n=138>
<sfo samp=7464102>
To the ...

<u who=F n=139>
<sfo samp=7464302>
Do you want me to curve past ... like, around the the avalanche.  Is
it nearer the edge?

<u who=G n=140>
<sfo samp=7518701>
Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's where you're supposed to tell me if you have
something there.

<u who=F n=141>
<sfo samp=7554102>
Okay.  All right.  So then I curve ... Now I'm ... I'm on the
{ab|ea} east side of the concealed hideout.
<eo id=o9p>

<u who=G n=142>
<sfo samp=7694901>
<event desc="a short silence intervenes">
Yeah.  You should be on the east side.

<u who=F n=143>
<sfo samp=7719901>
<bo id=o9q>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=144>
<sfo samp=7720501>
You're curving right around it ...
<eo id=o9q>

<u who=F n=145>
<sfo samp=7747502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=146>
<sfo samp=7755102>
and then going straight along ... the bottom of the word
{ci|{ph|concede} hideout} ...

<u who=F n=147>
<sfo samp=7826901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=148>
<sfo samp=7842502>
And then, do you have a boathouse there?

<u who=F n=149>
<sfo samp=7877302>
I have a boathouse to the {br|south east=southeast}.

<u who=G n=150>
<sfo samp=7933502>
Okay.  Don't worry about it then.  You see the the highest point in
crane bay?

<u who=F n=151>
<sfo samp=7993102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=152>
<sfo samp=8009901>
Stop there ...

<u who=F n=153>
<sfo samp=8032702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=154>
<sfo samp=8046702>
{fp|Er}, as you're coming along straight east from concealed
hideout ...

<u who=F n=155>
<sfo samp=8110901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=156>
<sfo samp=8135701>
Okay?  Then come {ab|u} ... Go go south and go around in that
little ... half moon of crane bay ...

<u who=F n=157>
<sfo samp=8238102>
Okay.  Got it.

<u who=G n=158>
<sfo samp=8252102>
<bo id=o9r>
then circle over top of the ... second point in crane bay ...

<u who=F n=159>
<sfo samp=8301302>
Got it.
<eo id=o9r>

<u who=G n=160>
<sfo samp=8322902>
Then do you have a coconut palm there?

<u who=F n=161>
<sfo samp=8356302>
No.

<u who=G n=162>
<sfo samp=8367702>
Okay.  Well then keep following ... the ... the edge of the ... crane
bay ...

<u who=F n=163>
<sfo samp=8489501>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=164>
<sfo samp=8502701>

And then when you get to the ... You see where the {le|c} is in
{ci|crane bay}?

<u who=F n=167>

Go west.  Okay.

<u who=G n=172>
<sfo samp=8723701>
<bo id=o9t>
Go west.  And then do you have a pebbled {ab|ston} ... a pebbled shore,
there?

<u who=F n=173>
<sfo samp=8770501>
Yes, I've got pebbled shores.
<eo id=o9t>

<u who=G n=174>
<sfo samp=8801901>
Okay.  You're going west ...

<u who=F n=175>
<sfo samp=8830501>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=176>
<sfo samp=8836102>
then curve over the top and come down the west side of the pebbled

<u who=F n=177>
<sfo samp=8897302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=178>
<sfo samp=8914102>
<bo id=o9u>
Okay.  Do you have anything below the pebbled shore?

<u who=F n=179>
<sfo samp=8935102>
I've got washed stones {ab|belo} below, {br|south west=southwest} of
it.
<eo id=o9u>

<u who=G n=180>
<sfo samp=8988502>
Okay.  Then curve out the west side of it ...

<u who=F n=181>
<sfo samp=9045701>
West side of washed stones?

<u who=G n=182>
<sfo samp=9066102>
Yeah.  And {ab|g} stop right ... on the shore, right by the flagship.
You have a flagship there?

<u who=F n=183>
<sfo samp=9196302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=184>
<sfo samp=9206901>
Okay.  Stop right on the shore, right before you get to the ... edge
of the shore where the flagship is.

Okay, let's go back to the start.

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=4825701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=4837901>
Start point.  Fire site.  Fire {fp|uh} ... Site of forest fire.

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=4904302>
Got it.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=4915901>
Go around the left-hand side ...

<u who=F n=68>

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=5052102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=5068702>
<bo id=o12h>
and swing back up, where you're almost even with the {le|e} in {fp|uh}
{ci|forest fire} ... Swing back up north ...

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=5233901>
Okay, am I going ...

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=5258302>
You're going ...

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5259102>
to the west of adventure playground?
<eo id=o12h>

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5315901>
Picnic site.  Yeah, you're going to the {fp|uh} left-hand side.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5384702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5389901>
The west side.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5408502>

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5431502>
And straight up ...

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=5453701>
<bo id=o12i>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=5454102>
And you should be directly in line with the {le|e} in {ci|fire}.
<eo id=o12i>

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=5507502>
Got it.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=5520701>
Okay, start heading ... east, for about ... the length of a pen.
<event desc="pause">

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=5703102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=5724502>
Okay, and stop when you're at the length of the pen ...

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=5772902>
So just before ... like, if you came straight up off of the {le|f} in
{ci|farmyard}?

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=5869302>
You head ... {le|F} in {ci|farmyard}?

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=5926102>
<bo id=o12j>
Or ... Do you have that?  Or do you have ...

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=5949502>
Yeah, the farmyard's down in the bottom right-hand corner of mine.
<eo id=o12j>

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=6003901>
<bo id=o12k>
Yeah, but if you just came straight up from the {le|f}, is that as far
over ...

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=6054901>
That's ... Yeah, that's perfect!
<eo id=o12k>

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=6089502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=6100701>
Okay.  Then head {ab|st} straight north ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=6171901>
So I'm just going up the ... right-hand side of privately owned
fields?

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=6269901>
Privately owned fields.  And the granite quarry on top?

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=6321102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=6327102>
You got the granite quarry?  Okay, head straight up towards the
granite quarry, go over the top of it, just missing it by
about a quarter of an inch, all the way round.

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=6481302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=6487302>
<bo id=o12l>
Once you get to the left-hand side ... of ...

<u who=F n=100>

You're there?

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=6567302>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=6579502>
Okay, start bending down and go in between waterfall and train
crossing.

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=6670102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=6699702>
And head right up the right {fp|uh} the left-hand side of waterfall
directly north.

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=6791502>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=6810701>
Okay?  Curve into the far right-hand edge of waterfall, where you see
the mountain ...

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=6928901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=6936702>
just only about an inch and a half, then head directly north for about
two inches.

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=7049702>
Okay, where am I going in relationship to public footpath?

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=7128302>
<bo id=o12m>
I don't have the public footpath.  So what I want you to do {ab|i} ...

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=7177502>
Okay, do you have cornfields?
<eo id=o12m>

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=7210701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=7228102>
<bo id=o12n>
Okay, {ab|pub} ...

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=7229302>
You're about two inches below cornfield, heading north.
<eo id=o12n>

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=7283102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=7285102>
Stop there.

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=7310701>
<bo id=o12o>
Got it.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=7322302>
Got it?  Okay.  Now we curve on a forty-five degree angle, down
towards fallen cairn.  You have that?
<eo id=o12o>

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=7469502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=7481901>
So almost a straight line heading down towards fallen cairn ...

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=7550302>
Okay, am I going under it?

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=7568901>
Go underneath fallen cairn.  Make a wide loop ... and just leave about
a quarter of an inch on either side ...

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=7724702>
There.

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=7739102>
Okay, head back up north {ab|ea} {fg|er} northwest ... missing
limestone cliffs.

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=7865102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=7873502>
by about half an inch.  Get up to the lake until you're about a
quarter of an inch away from the lake ...

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=7990302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=129>
<sfo samp=7998901>
Okay.  Follow the lake heading west ... to the finish point.  Which is
about one inch from the bottom ...

<u who=F n=130>
<sfo samp=8165102>

Okay Brian, you ready?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=69102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=81302>
Let's make this a quick one.  Do we have {fp|uh} crest falls?  Down at
the bottom of start point?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=172501>
Got it.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=197302>
Okay.  Do you have, just above that, off to the right, old temple?

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=288901>
Yes.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=305901>
Okay.  You go about two inches to the left, and there should be poison
stream.

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=431502>
Don't have that.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=447701>
Okay, put in {fp|uh} just an {le|x} there and a cross-bones or
whatever, and it's just slightly below the level of the temple, the
bottom of the temple?  {ip|Bout=About} two inches over.

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=612901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=633501>
Okay, and about another half inch over from that ... you'll have
footbridge.  Same as we had on the last one?

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=767302>
Right.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=786502>
<bo id=o13a>
Four poles and ...

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=795102>
Okay, that's only ... a half inch from the poison river?
<eo id=o13a>

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=859501>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=871102>

Okay, I was over closer to the temple.  Okay, I'll put it over closer

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=945501>
Okay, {ip|cause=because} ... So you have footbridge then, {fg|eh}?

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1001302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1009901>
So as we go around we got crest falls
<event desc="Follower coughs">
we make a big turn, footbridge, poison stream, old temple.  And we'll
make a big round up.  You got abandoned truck?

<u who=F n=20>

<sfo samp=1323302>
Slate ... Slate mountain ... The abandoned truck is about half way up
slate mountain ... and slate mountain {ph|iiis=is} between the old

<eo id=o13c>

<u who=G n=23>

is in line with the top of the ... point on the old temple ...

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1894102>
Okay, good.  That gives me an idea where to go.  Slate mountain?

<sfo samp=2113302>
Don't have baboons.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2131901>
Okay.  Right underneath abandoned truck, where the {le|a} is, go down
two inches, over half an inch, and put a little mountain ... and
baboons on it.
<event desc="long pause">
Okay?

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2436901>

We're going the left-hand side.
<eo id=o13i>

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=3847302>
Down the left, okay.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=3873702>
Okay, just slightly turn up, go straight across then, as you hit the

and head directly west.  Go underneath ... the banana trees, I guess
you said it was?

<u who=F n=64>

<sfo samp=6202302>
All right, I'm at the top of the mountain.
<eo id=o13p>

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=6233102>
You're at the top?  Okay, you must have something above white
mountain?

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=6320501>
Lemon grove.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=6348502>
Lemon grove?  Is that ... How {ab|f} ... How high from white mountain
is it?

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=6439302>
{fp|Uh} about three fingers ...

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=6483302>
<bo id=o13q>
Three {ab|fi} ...

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=6484302>
and the left edge of it is directly in line with the highest point of
white mountain and it runs about one inch to the right.
<eo id=o13q>

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=6663901>
One inch to the right, towards cobblestone street?

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=6701102>
Yes.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=6716702>
<bo id=o13r>
Okay.

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=6716702>
Actually, it ... it's {fp|uh} in line with the word {ci|pyramid} ...
<eo id=o13r>

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=6813302>
<bo id=o13s>
Okay ... Good.  You have to avoid that.  {ph|Bypy} ... Bypass that ...
and go over ...

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=6937902>
Which way?
<eo id=o13s>

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=6954102>
over the top of it ...

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=6983302>
So I'm going up the left side of it?

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=7018502>
Yeah, up the left side of it ...

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=7051702>
<bo id=o13t>
Okay, {ab|s} now, when I leave the top of white mountain at the point,
am I going straight up?

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=7143701>
Straight north.
<event desc="experimenter says `six minutes'">
Straight north.
<eo id=o13t>

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=7209702>
Straight north, okay, I'm at the top of lemon grove.

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=7264102>
Now.  We'll just make sure where this lemon grove is.  We're almost
finished here.

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=7333302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=7340901>
The lemon grove ... is in line, sort of thing, with cobblestone and
off to the left of {fp|uh} pyramid, right?

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=7458502>
Correct.

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=7469502>
Okay.  Once you get above your lemon grove ... hang a

about a quarter of an inch up from the base of the pyramid ...

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=7661102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=7676702>
and then just follow the shape of the pyramid to the top and down the
other side.  Going up the left-hand side ...

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=7820102>
<bo id=o13u>

<u who=F n=134>

No, but I've sort of put it in.

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=8343701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=137>

Okay, now am I going ...

<u who=G n=139>
<sfo samp=8518502>
You're going south.

<u who=F n=140>
<sfo samp=8538102>
{br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled

<u who=G n=141>
<sfo samp=8649701>
<bo id=o13v>
No, you're going around it.
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">
Cobbled street on my map would be almost ... on the left-hand side of

<u who=F n=142>
<sfo samp=8791102>
Okay.  All right, got you.

<u who=G n=143>

Your start, we went down the right {ab|ha} or the left-hand side of

<u who=F n=164>
<sfo samp=10151502>
Lemon grove.

Lemon grove?  Over the top of the lemon grove, just about to the

A bite mark in crane bay.

{ph|Awwkay=Okay}, we have to go around that ... to get to the {fp|uh}

about an eighth of an inch above them and straight ... heading east
... {ip|til=until} you get to the end of the {le|e} in {ci|village},
then angle yourself down to pine grove, so that your line comes right
below the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ... then you do two little loops
... one going east ... that's about an inch long, and then you cut

there? ... southwest staying about {fp|uh} a quarter of an inch to

<sfo samp=6920701>
Right.

<u who=G n=207>
<sfo samp=10931102>
<bo id=o19s>
Okay.  What I want you to do ... is come down from the
{ph|woooooord=word} ... or from the letter {le|w}.  See the {ab|wo}
letter {le|w}?

<u who=F n=208>
<sfo samp=11100501>
{ab|Ye} ...
<editorial text="this utterance time stamped 2,88 samples ahead of true position">

Yeah.

<u who=G n=211>
<sfo samp=11133900>
I want you to ... Make a point there ... and I want you to curve from
where you stopped writing last ... downwards, about an inch from the

<u who=F n=212>
<sfo samp=11352901>
Got you.

<u who=G n=213>
<sfo samp=11363102>
It's kind of {fp|er} confusing.  Now what I want you to do is
come out ... an inch to the left of there, like, due west of there ...

<u who=F n=214>
<sfo samp=11462701>
<bo id=o19t>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=61102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, Kim, you ready there?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=81501>
Sure am.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=99701>
You got a diamond mine?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=128302>
Yes.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=146102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have the start position?

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=178102>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=191502>
What I want you to do is I want you to loop down on the left-hand side
of the diamond mine {ip|til=until} you're underneath it.

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=288102>
{ip|Til=Until} {ab|r} ... I'm under the word {ci|diamond {ph|mind=mine}}?

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=325701>
Correct.

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=335302>
Under the {le|d}?

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=392701>
Excellent!  I'm there!
<eo id=o20a>

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=436701>
Do you have a wagon wheel?
<event desc="follower tuts">
To the right of your diamond mine?

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=503501>
<bo id=o20b>
No.  I have a cactus ... to ...

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=543302>
Where's that?
<eo id=o20b>

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=564502>
It is in the upper ... right-hand corner of my map ...

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=629302>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=634102>
below rift valley.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=672701>
Okay, I do not have that.  Is it directly below rift valley?

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=731502>
<event desc="tuts">
Yes!

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=756502>
Is it to the left or to the right of ... the word {ci|rift valley}.

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=813901>
To the left.

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=833701>
To the left?  {ab|H} like an inch over roughly?

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=880302>
{fg|Oh}, yeah.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=897502>
Okay.  Now, this is what {ph|hmph} we have to do.  It's about three
inches ...

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=996102>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1007701>
from your diamond mine to its right is the wagon wheel?

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1055901>
{fg|Oh}, okay.  So I have to avoid it?

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1090102>
Right.  Now {br|y you=you} have to proceed on a northeast east direction?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1169701>
Okay, definitely.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1189102>
<bo id=o20c>
For about three inches.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Got that?

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1223701>
Okay, but {ab|av} ...
<event desc="pause">
<eo id=o20c>

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1254102>
<bo id=o20d>
Maybe three and a half.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=1256701>
But avoid this wagon wheel.
<eo id=o20d>

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=1304901>
Pointed ... You should be going almost toward rift valley.

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=1372302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=1382901>
<bo id=o20e>
{ip|Kay=Okay}?

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=1383501>
So go now?
<eo id=o20e>

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=1399901>
Yes.  So go for three inches, and then stop.

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=1497102>
I'm stopped.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=1519502>
Okay.  Now I want you to do a little ... jaunt up ... north ...

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=1666901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=1676102>
and a little bit of a curve in towards the west.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=1742502>
<bo id=o20f>
{fg|Oh}, into the west.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=1743302>
Do you understand what I'm saying?  So ...

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=1771102>
Into the west?
<eo id=o20f>

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=1794102>
Yeah.  So just like a curve around where the wagon wheel would be.
Just a little bit.  Not ... Like, just {ip|til=until} you'd be at the
top of it.  Do not go completely around.  Do you understand?

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=1989502>
Yes, I do.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2011701>
Just go {ip|til=until} you're at the side of it.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2057302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=2082502>
<bo id=o20g>
Now I want you to {br|pro ceed=proceed} north for about an inch.  You
should almost be level with your start position.  On the ...
horizontally.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=2233901>
Yeah, I'm there.
<eo id=o20g>

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=2258901>
Okay?  Understand?

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=2277302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=2287901>
Now!  We're going to go right.  Right into the middle of rift valley.
See that ... how there's trees or cactuses on each side of it?

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=2436102>
Yes.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=2452901>
See in the middle where there's that gravel?

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=2490502>
<bo id=o20h>
Yeah.  Do I come ...

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=2507502>
That path?

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=2511302>
over the trees into the gravel?

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=2533102>
Yes.  You go over and then through right in the middle of the gravel.
<eo id=o20h>

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=2616901>
<bo id=o20i>
Okay and ...

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=2618102>
And ...
<eo id=o20i>

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=2627102>
<bo id=o20j>
And stop at the word {ci|rift}?  Like just to ...

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=2670302>
Yeah, right by where the {le|r} is.

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=2675302>
Over to the left of it?  Okay, I'm stopped there.
<eo id=o20j>

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=2727302>
Okay.  It should be about the same size as a pop can, that ...

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=2808702>
Yeah!

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=2824702>
<bo id=o20k>
Okay.  Now what I want you to do ...

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=2845102>
That's neat!

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=2857302>
is go south for about two inches.
<eo id=o20k>

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=2911502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=2925302>
Do you have rocks?

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=2952302>
Yeah!

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=2965302>
About an inch over the rocks, stop.  Over the big rock middle of it.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=3038502>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=3056502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a stone creek?
<event desc="pause">

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=3134502>
No.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=3147502>
Do you have white water?

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=3176302>
I have rapids?

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=3198502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Your white water is your rapids.

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=3229302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=3243302>
<bo id=o20l>
Now what I want you to do is ... See where the end of your {ci|rapids}
is written?

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=3293502>
{fg|Oh}, I have a swamp.  I ... I should tell you.
<eo id=o20l>

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=3341901>
Okay, where is that located?

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=3368302>
It is northwest of my rapids.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=3437102>
Northwest?  Yes, I see that.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=3469302>
<bo id=o20m>
Okay.  {ph|S} that's ...

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=3475702>
Now what I want you to do is I want you to go down on a southwest
direction ...
<eo id=o20m>

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=3571901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=3579901>
<bo id=o20n>
for about {ab|th} three inches.  You should be ...

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=3651701>
{fg|Oh} ... Where will I end up?
<eo id=o20n>

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=3702901>
About ... an inch and a half over from your white water ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=3795502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=3831901>
<bo id=o20o>
{ip|Kay=Okay}?  And ...

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=3840502>
And that's where I'll be?
<eo id=o20o>

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=3855901>
And you'll be down just sightly into the picture of the white water,
roughly.  There's a stone creek right there that you're trying to
avoid.  So you ... The stone creek protrudes a little bit down south
of the white water.  Do you understand?

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=4094901>
<bo id=o20p>
{fg|Oh}, yeah.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=4095102>
Like of the rapids?
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Are you down at the bottom point now? ...

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=4148901>
No, no, I ... I'm not there yet {ip|cause=because} I want to know, do
I loop around the rocks?
<eo id=o20p>

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=4224102>
<bo id=o20q>
Okay ...

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=4224901>
Like, or do I {ph|cu} hug the side of the rocks?

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=4252901>
All I do ... Just go straight from the {ab|poi} ... last point I gave
you ...
<eo id=o20q>

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=4327302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=4347502>
to the point almost equal with your rapids.  On a southwest heading.

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=4461902>
Okay.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=4482502>
And you should be about an inch and a half away from the white
{ab|wa} ... like, the rapids at this point.

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=4548702>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=4567302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what I want you to do is I want you to do a
{ab|bi} ... Do you have an outlaws' {br|ha ideout=hideout}?

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=4640302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=4655701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything underneath the white water?

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=4708302>
Yeah, a manned fort.

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=4748502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  How far is that underneath the white water?  Roughly?

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=4818102>
Three inches?

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=4848502>
Okay.  What I want you to do now, is I want you to make a big {le|c}.

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=4953502>
<bo id=o20r>
{br|O okay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=4958901>
Now with that {le|c} I want you to go all the way round the white
water on to its west hand side.  I want you to keep on the west and then
the {br|s outh=south} edge of your {fp|uh} thing that you gave me
but three inches below the white water.  Do you understand?
<eo id=o20r>

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=5220701>
<bo id=o20s>
{fg|Oh}, yeah okay, so ...

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=5236901>
A big {le|c}, just a big {le|c} ...
<eo id=o20s>

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=5266502>
Am I going around my rapids and around my manned fort?

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=5321302>
Yes.

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=5330701>
<bo id=o20t>
{fg|Oh}, okay.

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=5335302>
And you're staying on the left of both of them.
<eo id=o20t>

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=5366901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=5375102>
And you'll end up at the {br|b bottom=bottom} of your {fp|uh} ...

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=5438302>
Manned fort.

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=5453102>
<bo id=o20u>
Your manned fort.

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=5460302>
I'm there.
<eo id=o20u>

<u who=G n=129>
<sfo samp=5488701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, see your outlaws' hideout?

<u who=F n=130>
<sfo samp=5529901>
{gg|Mmhmm}!

<u who=G n=131>
<sfo samp=5537902>
I want you to aim straight for the {le|o}.  Draw a straight line
... between there and the {le|o}.

<u who=F n=132>
<sfo samp=5619302>
<bo id=o20v>
There.

<u who=G n=133>
<sfo samp=5624302>
You should be pretty close.
<eo id=o20v>

<u who=F n=134>
<sfo samp=5642902>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=135>
<sfo samp=5663102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, do you have a noose down on the right ... hand
... corner bottom edge?

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=5766502>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=137>
<sfo samp=5784502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {ab|s} a pond?  Or something resembling a
pond in the ... bottom right-hand area?

<u who=F n=138>
<sfo samp=5935901>
No. ... I have ... under my outlaws' hideout I have a gold mine ...

<u who=G n=139>
<sfo samp=6039901>
Okay.

<u who=F n=140>
<sfo samp=6046102>
and under that I have a noose.

<u who=G n=141>
<sfo samp=6090901>
<bo id=o20w>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything to the west of that?  Of the noose?

<u who=F n=142>
<sfo samp=6130701>
Yeah.  Stone slabs.
<eo id=o20w>

<u who=G n=143>
<sfo samp=6163701>
Okay, that's up high ...

<u who=F n=144>
<sfo samp=6194901>
Okay.

<u who=G n=145>

<u who=G n=147>
<sfo samp=6249901>
Do you have a saloon bar?

<u who=F n=148>

Yeah.

<u who=G n=149>
<sfo samp=6286102>
Okay.  For now what I ...

<bo id=o20x>
And that's all I've got.

<u who=G n=151>
<sfo samp=6324901>
Okay, for now what I want you to do is measure off about an inch and a

<eo id=o20x>

<u who=F n=152>
<sfo samp=6448502>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=153>

<u who=F n=154>
<sfo samp=6545302>
<bo id=o20y>
{ip|Kay=Okay} ...

<u who=G n=155>

Let me think.  {br|I inch=Inch} and a half over and inch and a half

<u who=G n=157>
<sfo samp=6672102>
It should be ... right underneath your stone slabs but down about three

{ip|Kay=Okay}, what we have to do now is we have to go {br|o over=over}

<u who=F n=176>
<sfo samp=7548302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=177>

<sfo samp=7730501>
There.

<u who=G n=179>

{fp|Oh}, so I'm ...

<sfo samp=8237102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=197>
<sfo samp=8248502>
Draw a big {le|x} there, that's your finish.

<u who=F n=200>
<sfo samp=8364901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=201>
<sfo samp=8373901>
And then go underneath the saloon bar in a gradual curve about the

<u who=F n=202>
<sfo samp=8550701>
Say it to me again.

Done.

<u who=G n=169>
<sfo samp=7733502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now your finish ... is about half an inch ... towards

<u who=F n=170>

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2302302>
Right.

No, I don't have that.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=3093901>
You don't have anything {ab|aw} {fp|er} about ...

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=3122701>
<bo id=o28f>
Two ...

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=3123502>
eleven o'clock, two inches away?
<eo id=o28f>

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=3153102>
{fp|Er}, no.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=3171102>
Okay.  Right there, there's lost steps.

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=3223702>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=3241502>
Now what you want to do is, when you {fp|er} ... {ab|whe} when you're
going north just before the waterfall ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=3338302>
Yes.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=3351901>
you keep to the right of the lost steps, so {ab|bas} ... you're
straight up ...

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=3413901>
<bo id=o28g>
Yeah.  Okay, I'm to ... {ab|r} ...

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=3421901>
You go straight up and you {ab|g} ... you'll stay to the right of it ...
<eo id=o28g>

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=3461302>
I'm at the top of the lost steps now.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=3490102>
Okay.  Now, {fp|er} to {fp|er} ... About nine o'clock ... do you have
{fp|er} fallen pillars?  From the lost steps, pardon me.

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=3644502>
Yeah, I {ab|ha} ... Yes, I do.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=3683502>
Okay.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=3695901>
And ... Okay.  Yes I do.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=3722502>
Okay.  Now do you have anything {ph|aat=at} about seven o'clock from
the fallen pillars?

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=3781102>
I have the flamingoes.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=3804702>
You have flamingoes ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What you do is, then {fp|er}
... You go left ... or {ab|par} correction {fp|er} ... You go west
from the lost steps ...

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=4020302>
Across the top, right?

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=4040901>
Yeah.  {ab|You} you're still on top of the lost steps.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=4074302>
And about parallel with the fallen pillars?

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=4114901>
Yeah.  And about half way in between the lost steps and the fallen
pillars you go {ab|d} ... you start angling down on a
{ph|south_uh_west=southwest} trajectory ...

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=4241302>
Southwest {ab|tr} ... So I just ... go by the bottom {fp|er}
right-hand corner of the fallen pillars?

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=4320302>
Yeah.  And then you straighten right out as soon as you {fp|er}
... you come in line with the {fp|er} ...

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=4406302>
{ab|F} ...

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=4422702>
beginning of the fallen pillars.

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=4450502>
The bottom of them, right?

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=4471502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=4481302>
Okay, I'm going across the bottom of the fallen pillars now ...

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=4535102>
Okay.  Now looks like what we want to do is, you want to go south, and
you want to hook around the flamingoes.  You want to go underneath, and
stay to the left of the flamingoes.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=4695701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=4719302>
<bo id=o28h>
Okay.  Now, {fp|er} ...

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=4734901>
So I've gone all the way round the flamingoes?

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=4767502>
{ab|A} ...

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=4768102>
Just about?
<eo id=o28h>

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=4782502>
Yeah.  Okay.  Now {fp|er}, do you have ... Reference {fp|er} your
flamingoes, do you have at about one o'clock, about three, three and a
half inches away, do you have ancient ruins?

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=4956302>
One o'clock.  Yeah, I have ruined city.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=4996702>
<bo id=o28i>
Okay.  What you want to do is you {fp|er} ...

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=5026102>
Three birds on top.
<eo id=o28i>

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=5050901>
Okay.  {ab|Y} You want to angle towards the ancient ruins ...

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=5101302>
Yes.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=5111702>
but you want to keep ... to the left of it.

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5169502>
<bo id=o28j>
So you ...

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=5171102>
So you angle towards, and you keep to the left, of the ancient ruins.
<eo id=o28j>

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=5225302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the ancient ruins now.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=5253502>
Okay.  Now, twelve o'clock, directly twelve o'clock about {fp|er} ...
again three, three inches away, do you have stones?

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=5389901>
Okay.  Reference the three birds at the top of ruined city ...
<event desc="pause">

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=5482702>
Sorry?

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=5490701>
Okay, reference the three birds at the top there ... of ...

<u who=G n=107>

The three what?  {ab|Ye} {fg|oh} yeah!  Okay.

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=5571901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, reference that ...

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=5622102>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=5624102>
at {ab|w} two o'clock, I have a rock fall.  But I have nothing at
twelve o'clock.

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=5727102>
You have nothing at two o'clock?  How far two o'clock?

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=5774901>
Okay.  I have rock fall at about ... two inches.

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=5841702>
Two inches away to the right?

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=5871302>
<bo id=o28k>
Yeah.  To the ... northeast, from the ruined city I have {ab|r} ...

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=5931502>
Okay, I don't have that.  Okay, looks like what you want to do is,
you got {fp|er} ...
{ip|Kay=Okay}, you got rock fall ...
<event desc="pause">
Okay.  {ab|Direc} ... Okay, with me, three inches away, I have stones.
{fp|Er} {ab|refere} ...

<u who=F n=116>

To the north, right?
<eo id=o28k>

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=6238502>
Yeah.  {ab|Wha} ... I guess what you want to do is, you want to ... go
underneath the stones ...

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=6316102>
Right.

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=6321102>
<bo id=o28l>
And yet you want to stay on top of the rock fall.
<event desc="short pause">
So when you ... I guess you go up north ... and you ...

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=6439102>
Straight north, so I'm on the left side of ruined city still?
<eo id=o28l>

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=6506502>
Yeah.  And then you go straight, and I guess {fp|er} ... You have the
rock fall there.  You just want to swoop around to the right so you're
right on top of the rock fall.

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=6635102>
Okay, so I go underneath the stones, right?

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=6676702>
Yeah.  You go underneath the stones.  You're right on top of the
rock fall.

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=6741302>
Yes.

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=6764502>
Okay.  Now, reference the {fp|er} stones, do you have a {fp|er}
... {fp|er} I guess about three o'clock ... {fp|er} two inches away,
do you have a white mountain?

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=6960102>
Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... {ab|M} My white mountain ...

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=7033701>
{gg|Uh-huh}.

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=7053302>
{fp|Erm}.  If you draw a line between ruined city and white mountain ...

<u who=G n=129>
<sfo samp=7137302>
<bo id=o28m>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=130>
<sfo samp=7138102>
that's where my rock fall is.
<eo id=o28m>

<u who=G n=131>
<sfo samp=7180701>
Okay.

<u who=F n=132>
<sfo samp=7195701>
So, do you ... Do I go ... Do I go ... Which side do I go?  Above the
rock fall or below the rock fall?

<u who=G n=133>
<sfo samp=7331901>
<bo id=o28n>
No, you go above the rock fall.

<u who=F n=134>
<sfo samp=7355901>
Okay, so I'm above the rock fall, I do have a white mountain.
<eo id=o28n>

<u who=G n=135>
<sfo samp=7411102>
Okay.  Basically you want to ... The way the the mountain peak goes
you do the exact same thing, sticking right by it.  You go up on the
{fp|er} northeast trajectory, when you reach the peak you come down
on the southeast trajectory.

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=7641702>
Got it.

<u who=G n=137>
<sfo samp=7655901>
Okay.  And {ab|whe} ... and when you're right ... when you're right level
with the {fp|er} wording {ci|white mountain} ...

<u who=F n=138>
<sfo samp=7726702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=139>
<sfo samp=7734302>

have anything below the white mountain?

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=47701>
Okay, Adam.  Starting point is right above the site of a forest fire.
Do you have that?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=118501>
Got both of them.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=150901>
You got both forest fires?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=176901>
No, I got the {ab|s} forest fire and the start point.
<editorial text="the Follower laughs lightly as he says this">

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=236502>
Okay.  Do you have the {fp|er} ... Directly below the site of the

<sfo samp=334901>
No I don't.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=351901>
Okay.  About {fp|er} directly, six o'clock, about {fp|er} ... inch and

An inch and a half down?

{ip|Kay=Okay}.

So what you want to do is, you want to start above the {fp|er} ...
start {ph|thuuuh=the} site of forest fire ... You want to {fp|er} ...
{ip|Kay=Okay}, you start dead-centre on top of the site of the forest
fire.  You curve around, so you're on the left-hand side of the ...
left-hand side of the forest fire ...

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=1008701>
Got it.

<u who=G n=17>

Okay, and as soon as you reach pretty much {fp|er} the last {ab|picn}
{fp|er} the last bench ... {gg|Oh} shit, you don't have picnic site
there.  Okay.  Right where the {le|e} from {fp|er} the {ci|forest fire}

{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=91>

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=66901>
Okay, Adam.  Reference your start point.

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=105501>
Seen.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=117102>
Okay, do you have anything ... Do you have any landmarks right below
it, like, in the ... in the line there?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=225102>
No, all I have is burnt forest off to the right.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=275502>
Then do you have anything below that?

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=302501>
I have {ab|c} carpenter's cottage right below, like an inch below
{fp|uh} burnt forest.
<event desc="pause">

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=446102>
Okay.  And you have nothing to the left of carpenter cottage.

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=533901>
Nothing.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=544701>
Okay.  What you want to do is {fp|uh} ... Reference your start {ab|poi}
... Okay {fp|uh} actually, reference carpenter cottage.  To {fp|uh} the
right of it, an inch away, do you have anything there?

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=735102>
I have a ravine.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=755901>
Okay, right above it, do you have anything?

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=798302>
<bo id=o34a>
No.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=799102>
The ravine.  You have nothing above the ravine?
<eo id=o34a>

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=863302>
Nothing.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=877701>
Okay, so about {fp|uh} ... an inch away from the burnt forest
<event desc="sighs">
you have a remote village.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=1061102>
Remote village?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=1081901>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1112701>
So there's four of them in a little square there?

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1157102>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=1176901>
<bo id=o34b>
Got it.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1177502>
Okay.  You got your starting point?
<eo id=o34b>

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1212701>
Got it.

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1236502>
What you do is {fp|uh} you go south, but you head towards the burnt
forest a bit.

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1337901>
<bo id=o34c>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1340302>
And as as soon as ... Like, you you start aiming {ab|k} ... aiming
towards the {le|b} ...
<eo id=o34c>

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1413302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1427701>
And as soon as your {fp|uh} pen ... like {ab|yo} ... As soon as the
ink {fp|uh} comes in the same line as it, you start curving the opposite
way and what you want to do is you want to swing out and, looks like,
keep to the left of carpenter cottage, {ip|til=until} you get to the
bottom of it, make a sharp right, go east ... until {fp|uh} ... you're
right below the {le|e} in {fp|uh} the word {ci|forest} ...

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1918102>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1940302>
then what you do is you go {fp|uh} up on a {fp|uh} northeast
trajectory, and you go up above the ravine, as soon as you're on top
of the ravine {ab|yo} you make a sharp right.

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=2144102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=2167901>
And so {fp|uh} ...
<event desc="tuts">
{ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {fp|uh} pine grove?

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=2257302>
Yes.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2273901>
Okay, what you do is {fp|uh} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're in between the
ravine and the remote village, you go about an inch, inch and a half,
then what you do is {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... go ... southeast down
towards the pine grove ...

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2629502>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2643102>
And as soon as you {fp|uh} ... As soon as your pen comes in the same
line as the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ...

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2725102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2735102>
you swing out to the right ... Okay, do you have anything right below
the pine grove?

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2825502>
Avalanche.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2843702>
You have an avalanche?

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=2867701>
Do you have an avalanche?

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2883702>
<bo id=o34d>
No I don't.  That's what it is.  Okay, you want to swing out {ab|arou} ...

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2922302>
{fg|Oh}, hang on a sec ... avalanche.  Reference {fp|uh} the {le|e} in
{ci|pine grove}, the last {le|e}?
<eo id=o34d>

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=3016102>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=3025901>
It's {fp|uh} five o'clock.  It's about an inch away, so it's close to
the edge of the paper.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=3133901>
{fg|Oh}, okay, it's on the other side!

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=3163502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3181102>
Okay, well, looks like what you want to do is you want to ... swing
towards it, yet you don't want to go around it, so you want to swing
towards it, but you want to keep to the left side of the avalanche.

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=3402701>
Okay, so ... sorry, hang on a second.  I've got ... I'm in level with
the {le|p}, right?

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=3472701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=3473102>
Of {ci|pine grove} ...

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=3486701>
<event desc="sniffs">
Yeah.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=3500102>
And I swing to the south now?

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=3561701>
{fp|Uh}, {ab|y} you're swinging towards ... {ab|Y} You're still going
south but {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... Basically, look at a pregnant lady
sideways, at her abdomen, the way that it is ...

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=3762302>
Right.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=3771701>
How it juts out and then {ab|i} it swoops back in ...

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=3823901>
So is she {ab|l} ...
<event desc="laughs">
{ab|Wh} ... Is her belly facing the bottom of the paper?

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=3889502>
Her her belly's facing towards the {fp|uh} the edge of the paper where
the avalanche is.

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=3969302>
{fg|Oh}, okay, seen.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=3993702>
So you ... So you swing back out and then you ... {ab|whe} when
you ... when you {ph|sig} swing back in, you should be right below the
{le|r} in {ci|pine grove} ...

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=4142901>
So all ... I go all the way out towards the avalanche, then?  With
this pregnant belly?

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=4215901>
Yeah.
<event desc="pause">

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=4290102>
And I come back?

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=4313102>
You come back in, yeah.

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=4332901>
Below the {le|r}?

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=4376502>
Yeah.  Okay, so you're at the {le|r}.  Okay now, below the avalanche
you have a {ab|c} a concealed hideout?

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=4476102>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=4491902>
Okay, you want to do the exact same thing, you want to swing out to
the right ... Actually, yeah, you ... Okay, {ab|thi} this one you
want to encircle so {ab|y} you go over top of it and you hook
around ...

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=4709901>
I go between avalanche and concealed hideout?

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=4773502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=4802102>
And I go ... do a buttonhook around concealed hideout.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=4857901>
{ab|Button} ... Yeah.  And then you go straight across so you're going
straight west.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=4953302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading west.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=4976702>
<bo id=o34e>
Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5065302>
I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
<eo id=o34e>

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5119702>
Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5226901>
<bo id=o34f>
Yes.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5228701>
Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.
<eo id=o34f>

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5306302>
Right above the word {ci|crane} ...

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5334702>
<bo id=o34g>
Yeah from ...

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=5338302>
Directly in line with concealed hideout, they have a boathouse.
<eo id=o34g>

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=5384502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=5397902>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I don't have that.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=5415901>
<bo id=o34h>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=5416502>
I got it now.
<eo id=o34h>

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=5444901>
Okay now, okay, looking at the word {ci|crane bay} ...

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=5497502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=5508302>
See where the {le|b} and the {le|a} is?

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=5539702>
Yes.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=5554502>
Directly above you got, like, a {ab|p} a peak?

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=5592502>
Yes.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=5610502>
Okay.  As you swing around the concealed hideout you're going
straight ...

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=5683302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=5690901>
Soon as you reach that peak ...

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=5713302>
{ab|Y} ...

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=5718302>
you you like drop straight down and you follow that curve, going
around, until you get to, like, the top of the {le|c}.  In the word
{ci|crane}.

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=5852502>
<bo id=o34i>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=5854302>
So you just follow the contour.
<eo id=o34i>

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=5888302>
<bo id=o34j>
Yeah, I'm there.  I'm at the {ab|t} ...

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=5907102>
Okay now do you have a coconut palm to the left of you?
<eo id=o34j>

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5982502>
No I don't.

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=6007502>
Okay, {fp|uh} there's a coconut palm about an inch away from the shore
of crane bay.

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=6089302>
Okay.  {fp|Um}, {ph|d-dr-d-dr-d} ...

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=6141302>
<bo id=o34k>
Actually ...

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=6143102>
{ab|Wh} ...
<eo id=o34k>

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=6153302>
Do you have a pebbled shore?

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=6173302>
I have a pebbled shore.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=6195102>
Okay, the coconut palm is one o'clock about a {ab|ha} ... three-quarter
inch away.
<event desc="pause">

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=6335501>
<bo id=o34l>
{ab|Cocon} ...

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=6336901>
So {ab|ba} basically all's you want to do is you just want to go in
between the coconut palm and the pebbled shore.  So {ab|i} {ab|w} ...
if you swoop down ...
<eo id=o34l>

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=6467702>
{ab|A} ...

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=6470102>
and just skim across top the ... of the pebbled shore you'll miss the
coconut palm.

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=6549702>
So I skim the shoreline a little bit longer?

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=6585701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=6595701>
Go underneath the coconuts ...

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=6628901>
<bo id=o34m>
Go ... Yeah.

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=6631102>
And above the pebbled shore?
<eo id=o34m>

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=6665501>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=6682902>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the top there then.

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=6716502>
Okay now, do you have anything {fp|um} ...

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=6763302>
<bo id=o34n>
Washed ...

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=6763901>
to the left of the flagship?
<eo id=o34n>

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=6808901>
I have the washed stones at ten o'clock.

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=6852902>
Washed stones.  Okay, {ab|y} you want to go ... you want to ...
you're going to want to go round ... them on the left-hand side.

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=6997702>
On their left side?

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=7019502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=7050701>
So I drop down?

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=7086302>
Yeah, so basically you swing around pebbled shore ...

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=7139702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=129>
<sfo samp=7148901>
And pretty much you're going diagonally down until you come in {ab|b}
... I guess ... line with the top of that {fp|uh} washed stones ...

<u who=F n=130>
<sfo samp=7276502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=131>
<sfo samp=7284302>
Then you buttonhook right around ...

<u who=F n=132>
<sfo samp=7317502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=133>
<sfo samp=7331102>
And your finish ... your finish {le|x} is about one centimetre away
from the {ab|f} {fp|uh} the shore.  Directly in line with the
flagship.

<u who=F n=134>
<sfo samp=7478302>
Right where that little hook is, {ab|th} {fg|eh} that little indent?

<u who=G n=135>
<sfo samp=7519901>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=7548701>
Got it.

<u who=G n=137>
<sfo samp=7561102>
Okay.

<sfo samp=4663901>
Okay.  Do you have the stone creek or the stone slabs?

<u who=G n=79>

Okay.  Now from there ... your line will start to {ab|c} {fp|er} ...
form a circle again and {fp|er} do you have a swan pond?

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5920302>
I do not.

<sfo samp=4981902>
West lake.  Okay.  Where you stopped the line at abandoned mine ...
you're going to take that line, you're going to arc it down ...
{ph|sssouthwest=southwest} about {fp|uh} two inches ...

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=5007702>
Okay.  So it would be at the shore of the lake?

<sfo samp=3658502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=3672302>
and then go down the west sides of those ... And then you go around
something.  I don't know what that is.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=3797701>
{fp|Er}, it's my avalanche site.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=3828901>
Okay.  {ph|Gooo=Go} to the {ab|ea} ... around it to the east ...
<event desc="pause">
And then ... Do you have something else there too?

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=3998502>
Just a concealed hideout, it's called.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=4044502>
Okay.  Well go down around ... {fg|Oh}, wait a minute.
<event desc="pause, with various breathy sounds from the Giver">
Where's your {fp|um} ... your thing in relationship to the grove?  Your

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=4337102>
It's {fp|erm} to the east ... {fp|er} two fingers, and it starts at two
fingers down ... and it's about three fingers wide.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=4589901>
{fp|Erm}, where is it, like?  Is it right underneath the pine grove?

No.  It's {fp|er} off to the ...

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=4864901>
Yeah.

If you go down three fingers, that's where the start of it begins.  And
it goes over ...

<sfo samp=5420102>
No.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=5428302>
<bo id=o45j>
The {le|b} in {ci|crane} ... Okay.  I have a boathouse ... you know

{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=95>

Yeah.

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=6114702>
like ...

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=6127702>
One ... {ip|bout=about} one finger width past the {le|c} ... and then
head straight down to that point ... right above {fp|er} the bay there.
And then follow that little ravine there, the cut ... in the bay.

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=6399901>
Okay.  So the second point, I go right to it, almost?

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=6449102>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=6454702>

But don't ...

<u who=G n=103>

Go over it.  And then, underneath the palm tree ...

Okay.  Then you're going to {ph|llloop=loop} down, to a point

Tent.

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=710502>
All right.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=726502>

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=1247102>
All right.

Under the leaf?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=1385102>
{fp|Uh} {ph|bii} {ph|puh} right underneath the {ab|t} base of the tree.

<u who=F n=48>

Okay Mark, do you have {ph|thuuh=the} crest falls?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=102302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=110901>
Okay, go down to {le|c} ...

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=148701>
{fp|Uh}, right or ... or east or west?

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=179102>
West side.

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=202302>
Okay, I'm there.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=232701>
Do you see where ... Do you have baboons?

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=268102>
{fp|Uh}, no.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=306701>
It's up a bit ...

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=335102>
<bo id=o49a>
{ip|Kay=Okay} ...

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=335701>
on the left side.
<eo id=o49a>

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=363901>
{fp|Uh}, no.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=392501>
You still don't?  Okay.  Take a full hand ...

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=453501>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=469102>
{fp|uh} and {ph|gooo=go} directly west of crest falls.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=562701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, straight across?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=584701>
Straight across.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=603102>
Done.  I got a banana tree there.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=632102>
Yeah, I figured you had something.  Do you have a footbridge?

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=685701>
Yeah.  Go up into the footbridge?

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=712302>
Yeah, go {ph|gnthg} go {fp|uh} ...

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=784302>
<bo id=o49b>
{ab|Alri} ...

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=784701>
go right to the end of it on the east side ...
<eo id=o49b>

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=850102>
The east side?

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=867502>
Yeah, go right over top ...

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=905901>
Okay, I don't go around the banana tree?

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=950701>
Yeah, go right around it.

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=979701>
<bo id=o49c>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, to the west though, right?

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=998501>
To the west, that's right.
<eo id=o49c>

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1017102>
<bo id=o49d>
Right, and then I go over to the east?  Yeah, I'm at the {ab|footbri} ...

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1071502>
Yeah, across the footbridge.  Do you have the poisoned stream?
<eo id=o49d>

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1135102>
{fp|Uh} no.

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1152502>
Okay, what you want to do is, is as soon as you get to the ... end of
the footbridge, come two fingers directly south ...

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=1284102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=1309302>
Do you have the old temple?

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=1342502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=1355901>
Okay, {ab|g} {fp|uh} go right to the west side of the old temple and
go up ...

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=1450901>
Now, I go south two fingers first?

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=1490701>
Yeah, go south two fingers to avoid the poisoned stream.

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=1557102>
Yeah, and then I go where?

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=1587901>
Go across ... to the old temple.  Leave yourself half an inch on the
west side.

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=1712502>
Okay.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=1728102>
Okay?  Do you have the abandoned truck?

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=1768901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=1784102>
Okay, what you want to do is ... go directly north on the west side of
the old temple ... Go one finger north ... of the abandoned truck ...

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=1994102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I've a got a mountain there.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2034901>
<bo id=o49e>
Okay, what you want to do is go over top of that mountain and
{ab|undernea} ...

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2077701>
And get over to the truck?
<eo id=o49e>

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2100901>
and underneath the truck.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2134701>
Over and under ... All right, I'm under the ... and I'm over ... I'm at
... the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned}.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=2225701>
Okay, perfect.  What you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ... half a finger
west ...

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=2388502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=2397701>
you need to come down another ... three fingers, underneath ... what I
have as baboons.

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=2556102>
Okay, and that'll take me just about to where I run into the line for
the footbridge, right?

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=2650102>
Yeah, almost.  Maybe a finger?

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=2685901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=2698901>
Okay, what you want to do then is ... {fp|Uh}, you have white mountain?

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=2771502>
Yeah.  And go up the side of white mountain?

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=2802701>
<bo id=o49f>
Okay ...

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=2805102>
The west side?
<eo id=o49f>

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=2819102>
Yeah, leave yourself enough room to get around the baboons.

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=2877102>
Got her.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=2889502>
Go up ... Go ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=2932901>
I'm at the top of the mountain, Dave.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=2961502>
Okay, go directly {fp|uh} ... Do you see where the pyramid is?

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=3045302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=3055901>
Go as far north as the base of the pyramid ...

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=3104901>
{ab|S} ... {fg|Eh} keep going up the side of the mountain?

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=3153102>
<bo id=o49g>
Yeah, but go straight north once you hit the peak, and ...

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=3216502>
Straight north!  I'll run into {ab|s} a lemon grove.
<eo id=o49g>

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=3281102>
Okay, go around the lemon grove ... {ab|g} to the west side.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=3364102>
Yeah, I'm around the lemon grove now.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=3392701>
Okay, go around the pyramid, up on top, and to the east.

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=3476502>
All right.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=3496102>
Okay, do you have a ... You don't have a cobbled street, do you?

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=3549102>
No, I got a poisoned stream though.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=3600702>
Okay, what you're doing is, go right underneath the pyramid, to the
edge of the pyramid ...

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=3688302>
To the west edge, right?

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=3711701>
That's right.  Do you have the remote village?

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=3774502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=3788502>
<bo id=o49h>
Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} follow a soft line,
{ph|dlike=like} go one finger west of the pyramid, and ...

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=3922701>
Yeah, I'm there now.
<eo id=o49h>

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=3939102>
Okay, and go directly south, underneath the remote village ...

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=4013502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=4014302>
Leave yourself half an inch ...

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=4044302>
Okay, I'm there now.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=4070502>
Okay, one finger ... east of the {le|e} ...

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=4158702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=4173102>
right at the same height as the letter {le|n} in {ci|mountain} ...

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=4258702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=4268102>
draw yourself an {le|x}, that's the finish.

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=4299702>
Done.

<u who=G n=1>
<sfo samp=47302>
Okay, you have your start point and you have ... a, like, a forest
fire ... underneath it?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=154302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=177701>
Okay, go out a {ab|cen} ... like ... a centimetre to the left so you're
like a half a centimetre down the left-hand side of the forest fire.
Go down about ten centimetres ...
<event desc="sighs">

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=421302>
Parallel with farmyard?

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=510102>
<event desc="pause">
Yeah, you want to be {ab|r} straight across from the bottom of
farmyard.

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=573901>
All right.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=591102>
Okay.  And then you want to go ... bend to the right about four
centimetres ...

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=746102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=762102>
And now you're going to go up the left-hand side of the adventure
playground.

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=834501>
The left-hand side?

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=853901>
Yeah.  So you got to kind of curve back ...

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=926701>
All right.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=946302>
And then ... Okay.  From the top of the adventure playground ... You
have something underneath your granite quarry, don't you?

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=1095302>
Yeah, privately owned fields.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=1148701>
Okay, we're going to go below that.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so you're going
to angle up to the corner and then head straight up the page and
circle above the granite quarry.

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=1323701>
{fp|Uh}, going around the right or around the left?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=1362502>
Around the right.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=1408501>
<bo id=o50a>
All right.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=1420502>
So you're going to go out to the right about, what's that, ten
centimetres or so?  To the ... To the right-hand edge of that
... {ph|hoo} whatever it is that's there.
<eo id=o50a>

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=1618901>
Okay, I came around the adventure playground on the left?

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=1675502>
<bo id=o50b>
Yeah.  Over ...

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=1693901>
under privately owned fields?
<eo id=o50b>

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=1730302>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1742502>
Hooked north?

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1768901>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1781501>
went up over top of the granite quarry?

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1827701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1839502>
And I'm now sitting at the {le|g}.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1883302>
Okay, good.  Good.  Exactly.  Okay {fp|um} ...
<event desc="whistles">
You don't have a ... Do you have a fence or anything underneath the
waterfall?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=2094302>
No.

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=2122302>
Okay, there's a fence about three centimetres below the word
{ci|waterfall}.
<event desc="short pause">
That runs straight across.

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=2310502>
All right.  How big is it?

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=2343102>
Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three
centimetres straight across.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=2539302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=2577901>
Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're
going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2692502>
<bo id=o50c>
Okay.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2692502>
So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an
angle ... and then go straight across ...
<eo id=o50c>

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2828702>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm right between them now.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2865502>
Okay.  {br|U under=under} the waterfall, like, under the word
{ci|waterfall} ...

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=2937102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2945502>
and curve up the left-hand side, follow it all the way up, and then
... See that very sharp peak?

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=3131502>
<bo id=o50d>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=3131502>
On the {br|l eft=left} hand side?  You just want to come above that to
the right about a centimetre.  Go straight up {ab|unti} {ip|til=until}
you're about a centimetre above it and then turn to the right.
<eo id=o50d>

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=3296901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm there.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=3314102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, stop there.  Then go another two centimetres ...

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=3377901>
<bo id=o50e>
On that ...

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=3379102>
So {ab|y} ... you're ... you should be straight above the right-hand
edge of the waterfall.
<eo id=o50e>

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=3501901>
<event desc="pause">
Yeah.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=3512502>
Okay.  Now you want to go north two more centimetres, straight north
two centimetres.

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=3671901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=3686102>
And now, do you have any obstacles around here?

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=3725302>
Yeah.  Public {fp|uh} {ph|tootpath=footpath} or something.  It's,
like, about an inch to my right.

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=3889702>
Yeah, that's good.  Okay, we're going to go ... above that and then down
to the right, and circle under the fallen cairn, on the right-hand edge
of the paper?

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=4092302>
All right, I'm under it.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=4133102>
Okay, you just make a big loop and come underneath the fallen cairn.

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=4194302>
I'm under it.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=4206502>
Okay, do you have limestone cliffs or, like, limestone or ...?

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=4287502>
No.  I have an east lake.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=4338901>
It's {ab|bet} ... It's between fallen cairn and east lake on the
right-hand edge of the paper.

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=4445102>
No.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=4460102>
Okay.  {fp|Um} ... this is the tricky part, right here.  Underneath
fallen cairn, when you circle back up ... {ab|y} ... you have to come
back to the left ... but {fp|uh} ... Okay, I'm going to give you a
point.  See the {le|e} in fallen cairn?

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=4860102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=4881702>
Five centimetres straight above that ... You you come around fallen
cairn and then you loop back up to that point.

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=5076902>
All right, I'm there.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=5097102>
<bo id=o50f>
Okay.  Now go {ab|s} ...

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=5113302>
I'm right at the very right-hand side of lion country.
<eo id=o50f>

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=5204502>
Okay, I don't have that on mine.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=5238901>
Okay, does ...

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=5264302>
<bo id=o50g>
{ab|Li} ...

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=5265701>
From that point, does your line hook low or does it go high?
<eo id=o50g>

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=5357302>
It goes straight up.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=5396502>
All right, heading for east lake?

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=5428502>
Yeah.  Until you're about a half a centimetre away again.

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5492302>
All right, I'm there.

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5511302>
And then follow it ... Okay, see the very bottom left-hand corner?

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5593701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5616102>
Okay, we're going to follow it around but instead of ... when we get
to that point, just keep going straight towards the cornfields for
about another centimetre.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5763701>
Okay.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5795102>
Mark the {le|x}.  That's the finish.

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=5826702>
That's it.  Done.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=5844702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=7>

<eo id=o51a>

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=438701>
I have banana tree to the very left and that's all I have.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=494102>
Very {ph|ferry=very} left.  All right, I want you to go ... {fp|um}
{ab|s} ... even with the crescent falls to the west, it's about
fifteen centimetres {ab|w} left, so you would pass your obstacle ...
and then you would arc up to the north.

<u who=F n=10>

Around my banana tree?

<sfo samp=1500102>
Yeah, like on it.

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1526701>

<sfo samp=4919502>
Okay.  Yeah.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=4940302>
And then we swing out, to the right, around the concealed hideout ...
and straight underneath it ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=5051302>
<bo id=o52j>
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">
<event desc="coughs">
Pardon me.  I hope that didn't get on the tape.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=5096502>
And {ab|sto} ... And {ab|sto} ... Stop {ab|whe} ... Stop when you get
to the {le|c}.
<eo id=o52j>

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=5167502>
So, go around it and make a backward {le|c} and stop under the {le|c}?

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=5246502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=5283102>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=5299702>
Okay.  Do you have a {ab|b} ... You don't have the boathouse just left
there, do you?

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=5388502>
Just left of it?

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=5408901>
Left of the concealed hideout.

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=5434502>
<bo id=o52k>
No.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=5434901>
You just have the one below it.  Okay.

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=5467302>
I have tilled land.
<eo id=o52k>

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=5513901>
I do, way up, too, but that's not going to come into play here.  You
just want to go a centimetre ... straight left of there.

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=5672902>
Above one of the crowns there, in crane bay?

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=5745102>
Yeah.  Just a little left of that big, first crown.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=5818701>
All right.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=5836901>
<bo id=o52l>
And then we're going to go straight down towards crane bay, and hug
the shoreline ... about a half a centimetre away and ...

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=6004901>
Down to where?
<eo id=o52l>

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=6027902>
<bo id=o52m>
{ab|F} ... Okay, We're going to follow it around in this sort of {fp|er}
... I don't know, that little dip there, to the next point ...

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=6167302>
Yeah.
<eo id=o52m>

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=6211901>
above the {le|c} ...

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=6242902>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=6261901>
Okay.  And then ... you're you're gently going to ... move out ... a
little farther, until you're straight across from the {le|c} on land.
You'll be about a full centimetre away from the shore.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=6563302>
<event desc="pause">
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=6587102>
Okay.  Go to the ... left of the {le|c}, across straight from the

{fp|er} water.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=6804901>
Okay.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=6821901>
Okay.  Now you have a pebbled shore, right?

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=6867302>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=6878302>
Okay.  I have a coconut palm tree ... above that, and we have to go
between them.

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=6967702>
Okay.  I'll cut it real close, then, the pebbled shore?

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=7014502>
Yeah.  About ... {fg|Oh}, about a half a centimetre'll do it.

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=7077702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=7086702>
It's just north of it.

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=7102302>
I'm between them.

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=7118901>
Okay.  And then go ... go all the way round the pebbled shore, until
you get to the {le|p}.

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=7228102>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=7243901>
Okay.  Do you have anything below that?

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=7283901>
{fp|Er} washed stones.

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=7325901>
Okay.  You're going to go round to the left of that ... and circle
around, and then come back in towards the flagship.

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=7466102>
Okay.  So I go ...

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=7506502>
You're making a big loop off to the left and then coming back.

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=7571502>
So I go out, around the pebbled shore, around washed stones?

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=7642502>
Yeah. ... And then back in so {ab|y} ... And then aim straight for the
flagship.

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=7796702>
<bo id=o52n>
I'm heading there.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=7801702>
Like ... come down and then head straight in at the very last, and
stop about a centimetre out from the shore.
<eo id=o52n>

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=7930701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=7940501>
That's it.

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=7965102>
Cut!

<sfo samp=65701>
All right.  {fp|Er}, you're right above a camera shop?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=109501>
Yes I am.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=133502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, underneath the camera shop do you have a parked van?
Or a truck?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=197701>
<bo id=o53a>
{fp|Er}, no I don't but I have allotments ... on my right.

<u who=G n=5>

<u who=F n=6>
<sfo samp=296302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=7>
<sfo samp=322302>
go to the west about one centimetre ...

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=366302>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=387302>
{ph|goooooo=go} down ... until you're even with the {le|c} in
{ci|camera shop} ...

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=461901>
Am I making a loop?

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=485901>
{fp|Er}, no.  You're just going straight down, almost.

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=527901>
<bo id=o53b>
Okay.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=528901>
It's a gentle loop.
<eo id=o53b>

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=554302>
<bo id=o53c>
Okay.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=556102>
To the {le|c}.
<eo id=o53c>

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=591102>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=605302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  You want to go {ph|dowwwn=down} six centimetres
straight south ...

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=706302>
From my {le|c}?

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=725502>
From your {le|c}.

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=738701>
Okay, I'm there.

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=764102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, then you want to {ph|gooo=go} east, {ph|abouuut=about}
four centimetres, do a gentle loop at the bottom ... to the south ...

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=929501>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=947102>
{ip|{ph|Kaay=Kay}=Okay}.  Do you see {ph|theee=the} allotments?

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1004701>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1019901>
The little tiny house, {ph|oooon=on} the west?

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1094701>
<event desc="slight pause">
Okay.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1113502>
You want to go up, and stop ... right there.

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1260501>
<event desc="long pause">
Okay, I'm right there.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1296901>
All right.  From the allotments do you have something that's about
... {fp|er} twelve to fifteen centimetres east and a little bit north
of it?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1538901>
A flight {ph|yu} ... a flight museum?

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1578302>
<bo id=o53d>
Looks good.  Is it directly ...

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1597701>
Says {ci|entrance} on it.
<eo id=o53d>

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1628302>
Is it underneath the {fp|er} abandoned monastery?

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=1698501>
Yes it is.  It's about ten {ab|cent} ... six centimetres away {ab|fro}
{fp|erm} ... underneath the flight {ab|mus} ... flight {ab|museu}
... {gg|Aagh}!  Six centimetres under {ph|theeee=the} monastery.

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=1853302>
Okay, what I want you to do ... is draw a gentle ... easterly
{ph|northerthe} ... northern ... line, so that it goes underneath
that object ...

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=2113701>
<bo id=o53e>
Underneath the flight {ph|yu} museum?  Like, under the ...

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=2138901>
Yes.

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=2152901>
under the words?  Yeah.
<eo id=o53e>

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=2173901>
And then it {fp|er} ... Soon as you pass it you turn up ...

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=2242901>
<bo id=o53f>
Okay.

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=2244302>
and you go straight up towards the monastery, and you pass on the
east side of the {le|y} ... and you arc around monastery and stop
at the {le|a}.
<eo id=o53f>
<event desc="pause">

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=2481502>
Over the top, right?

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=2496302>
Over the top.

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=2517701>
{ph|Ooookay=Okay}, I'm there.

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=2546502>
All right.  Do you have anything to the west of your {fp|er} ...
abandoned monastery?

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=2632502>
{fp|Erm}, I have a a west lake ... obviously to the west, and alpine
garden above that.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2752901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  How big is west lake?

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2785502>
West lake is about five centimetres tall and about seven {ab|seve}
seven centimetres wide.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2881102>
Is it right underneath the alpine garden?

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2924102>
It's about four, five, six centimetres underneath.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=2989702>
Okay.  So I think we're going over top of ... the lake.

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=3056102>
<bo id=o53g>
Okay.
Underneath the garden?

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=3073102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Underneath ... Okay, from the {le|a} we want to go ...
four centimetres west ...
<eo id=o53g>

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=3201901>
{ph|Oookay=Okay}.

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=3230102>
And then we want to arc up a little bit ...

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=3275302>
{gg|Mmhmm}.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=3283302>
towards the north, and then we go straight up the {ab|n} {fp|er} ...
the west side of alpine garden ...

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=3390102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=3407102>
{ph|aaaaand=and} you stop as soon as you're right above the garden ...

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=3498302>
<bo id=o53h>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=3499901>
then you {ph|gooooo=go} ... two centimetres east ... Do you have a
youth hostel?
<eo id=o53h>

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=3636901>
{fp|Erm} ...

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=3657901>
Right, {fp|er} ...

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=3673702>
No I don't.  I have nothing above ... within about ten centimetres
diameter.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=3759901>
Okay.  From where I left you you're right at the ... eastern ...
corner of the {fp|er} ... garden? ... {fp|Er}, northeast corner?
Of the garden?

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=3978502>
Yes I am.

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=3996302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to go straight north, {ph|forrr=for} ...
four and a half centimetres ...

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=4133102>
Okay.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=4156302>
three {ph|centimetrrres=centimetres} east ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Stop
right there for a second.

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=4270502>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=4283901>
Look {fp|erm} ... southeast.  Do you have a telephone booth?

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=4372901>
<bo id=o53i>
Yes I do.  Telephone box.
<event desc="sounds of mike being disturbed">
But that's at the bit ... That's the centre ...

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=4402502>
Okay.  Booth, box, same thing.  See ...

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=4442901>
centre-right of my page.
<eo id=o53i>

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=4469901>
{ph|Yeright=Yes, all right}.  Do you see the {le|t}?

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=4518302>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=4530502>
From where I left you draw a straight line to the {le|t}.

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=4581302>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=4606702>
<bo id=o53j>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, go ... right along the writing ... to the east ...

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=4655502>
Underneath?  Under?
<eo id=o53j>

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=4685302>
Under.

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=4697702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=4714502>
Then I want you to go ... up ... {fp|er} ... three centimetres once
you pass the {le|x} ...

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=4846702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=4868302>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Right above the telephone do you have a thatched, mud
hut?  Or a ...

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=4954302>
Level crossing.  Looks like a fence.

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=4991502>
Doesn't count.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=5007901>
No.  Okay I {ab|d} ... I have nothing there then.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=5043102>
All right.  I want you to reference where I last left you.  You're about
one centimetre to the east of the top of the {fp|er} ... telephone
box?

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=5201901>
One {ph|centrereet} ... centimetre on top?

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=5250502>
You're about one centimetre {fp|er} ...

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=5305901>
Higher.

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=5320102>
Higher.

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=5329702>
Okay.

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=5348901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to angle ... northwest for about two
centimetres ...
<event desc="sundry background noises">

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=5561102>
<bo id=o53k>
Forty-five degree angle?  Approximately?

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=5579901>
{ip|Bout=About} a forty-five degree angle.
<eo id=o53k>

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=5597102>
Okay.  I'm there.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=5620502>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Look up, and do you have a east lake?

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=5679302>
Yes I do.

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=5695102>
Can you see the {le|a} in {ci|lake}?

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=5727902>
{fp|Erm}, first {le|e}?  Or ...

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=5764702>
The {le|a}.

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=5775102>
First {le|a}?

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=5790701>
{le|A} in {ci|lake}.

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=5809302>
Okay.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=5830302>
You want to go straight north towards the {le|a}.  Stop about a half a
centimetre before you hit the water.

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=5954102>
I'm there.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=5975102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now you're going to turn west ... go straight along
the shore of the lake ... keeping that half centimetre and as soon
{rp|oon} as you pass the land ... See how it juts into the land?

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=6241502>
{fp|Erm} ...

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=6253502>
The water juts into the land?

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=6313901>
Are you talking east or west here?

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=6342502>
It would be on the {ab|wi} west side.  It's a little tiny jut.

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=6419702>
Bottom, right?

<u who=G n=115>

{ip|Kay=Okay}, Marcus {ph|Kental} Kendal, burnt forest?

<u who=F n=2>
<sfo samp=130901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=3>
<sfo samp=135701>
At start?

<u who=F n=4>
<sfo samp=163102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=5>
<sfo samp=166302>

<u who=G n=7>

Okay ...

<u who=F n=8>
<sfo samp=242701>
Over it?

<u who=G n=9>
<sfo samp=255302>
No.  {ph|nn-nn} ... This'll be a bit tricky.  {ab|G} {fp|uh} at the
{br|w west=west} tip in the middle ...

<u who=F n=10>
<sfo samp=388302>
<bo id=o54b>
West tip in the middle?  Yeah.

<u who=G n=11>
<sfo samp=424302>
{ab|Oka} {ab|we} you have a mark, {le|x}, right?
<eo id=o54b>

<u who=F n=12>
<sfo samp=470701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=13>
<sfo samp=480302>
Okay, go from that {le|x} to ... half a centimetre beside the {le|b}
in {ci|burnt}.

<u who=F n=14>
<sfo samp=596502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=15>
<sfo samp=618701>
Okay.  Go ...

<u who=F n=16>
<sfo samp=678501>
The middle log?

<u who=G n=17>
<sfo samp=738302>
<event desc="short pause">
Yeah, {ab|y} go to the {le|b} in {ci|burnt}.  You've got to go on an
angle {ip|cause=because} you're avoiding something.

<u who=F n=18>
<sfo samp=823102>
Yeah, I see what I'm avoiding.

<u who=G n=19>
<sfo samp=851701>
<bo id=o54c>
{fg|Oh} okay, good.  All right.

<u who=F n=20>
<sfo samp=866701>
Is it the ravine, the cottage or what?
<eo id=o54c>

<u who=G n=21>
<sfo samp=908302>
<bo id=o54d>
What's below the burnt forest that you have?

<u who=F n=22>
<sfo samp=934102>
I've got ... I've got a carpenter's cottage and ravine.
<eo id=o54d>

<u who=G n=23>
<sfo samp=979302>
Okay, go ... down to the east side of {ph|thuuh=the} cabin ...

<u who=F n=24>
<sfo samp=1095102>
<bo id=o54e>
The {ab|e} ...

<u who=G n=25>
<sfo samp=1096701>
go under and then come back up on the east side.  And up over the ravine.
<eo id=o54e>

<u who=F n=26>
<sfo samp=1213901>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, so you want me to go down the east side, go around to
the west and up in between that and the ravine.

<u who=G n=27>
<sfo samp=1324502>
Yeah, stay close to the ravine because there's a remote village above
it.

<u who=F n=28>
<sfo samp=1408901>
All right.

<u who=G n=29>
<sfo samp=1421901>
Okay?

<u who=F n=30>
<sfo samp=1424701>
Yeah, I'm going {ab|aro} ... I'm going underneath ... the carpenter's
house?

<u who=G n=31>
<sfo samp=1504502>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=32>
<sfo samp=1515701>
And I'm staying to the ... the east side ...

<u who=G n=33>
<sfo samp=1570901>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=34>
<sfo samp=1580502>
of the ravine?

<u who=G n=35>
<sfo samp=1607901>
That's right.  Perfect.

<u who=F n=36>
<sfo samp=1634701>
{ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm just slightly above the ravine now.

<u who=G n=37>
<sfo samp=1689502>
Okay, {fp|uh} do you have the pine grove?

<u who=F n=38>
<sfo samp=1741102>
{fp|Uh} {ab|t} ... Yeah, it's right at the east.

<u who=G n=39>
<sfo samp=1778701>
Okay, take your line and go ...

<u who=F n=40>
<sfo samp=1843901>
Around it?

<u who=G n=41>
<sfo samp=1863501>
No, you're going under it, just ... go under it closer to the pine
grove ...

<u who=F n=42>
<sfo samp=1958901>
Okay, so do I go straight across?

<u who=G n=43>
<sfo samp=1999701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=44>
<sfo samp=2061701>
<event desc="pause">
Okay, now I'm ... Now I {ab|th} ... Then I curve down and go around
the pines?

<u who=G n=45>
<sfo samp=2138701>
Yeah, you're going ... You'll stay to the west side.

<u who=F n=46>
<sfo samp=2177302>
<bo id=o54f>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=47>
<sfo samp=2177901>
Stop at {le|p}.
<eo id=o54f>

<u who=F n=48>
<sfo samp=2210502>
<bo id=o54g>
Yeah, {ab|g} I'm stopped at the {le|p}, yeah.  I'm there, Dave.

<u who=G n=49>
<sfo samp=2232901>
What do you have under pine grove that ...

<u who=F n=50>
<sfo samp=2265302>
I've got ... I've got a, like, a little hill, whatever.

<u who=G n=51>
<sfo samp=2319701>
Okay, go around it to the right.  Standard width.
<eo id=o54g>

<u who=F n=52>
<sfo samp=2391102>
To the right?

<u who=G n=53>
<sfo samp=2417701>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=54>
<sfo samp=2417901>
So you want me to go all the way under the pine grove and then down
around?

<u who=G n=55>
<sfo samp=2488302>
Stay to the west of the pine grove ...

<u who=F n=56>
<sfo samp=2521701>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=57>
<sfo samp=2531901>
and go in between that pine grove and whatever that little thing is.

<u who=F n=58>
<sfo samp=2613502>
Am I going north or south, Dave?

<u who=G n=59>
<sfo samp=2641302>
South.

<u who=F n=60>
<sfo samp=2692102>
<event desc="short pause">
Okay.

<u who=G n=61>
<sfo samp=2707901>
Okay, do you have the concealed hideout?

<u who=F n=62>
<sfo samp=2759502>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=63>
<sfo samp=2773702>
Okay ... That's just south of the other bump?

<u who=F n=64>
<sfo samp=2839901>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=65>
<sfo samp=2854102>
Okay, {ab|g} ...

<u who=F n=66>
<sfo samp=2863502>
It's in between those two?

<u who=G n=67>
<sfo samp=2882102>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=68>
<sfo samp=2895102>
Good enough.  I'm in between them now.

<u who=G n=69>
<sfo samp=2928901>
Okay, don't go in between them.  Make a little indent to where ... you
know, they get closer, and go around that one to the east as well.
And underneath.

<u who=F n=70>
<sfo samp=3135302>
Underneath the concealed hideout?

<u who=G n=71>
<sfo samp=3168302>
Yeah.  Come back west, straight ...

<u who=F n=72>
<sfo samp=3223502>
Okay, I'm at the same concealed hideout.

<u who=G n=73>
<sfo samp=3268102>
Okay, {ab|y} come back south and to the west around ...

<u who=F n=74>
<sfo samp=3337701>
South and to {ab|th} ... around the bay?

<u who=G n=75>
<sfo samp=3371901>
Yeah ...

<u who=F n=76>
<sfo samp=3388502>
<bo id=o54h>
{ab|Stick} ... {ab|St} ...

<u who=G n=77>
<sfo samp=3388702>
Yeah, you're ... you're coming underneath it.
<eo id=o54h>

<u who=F n=78>
<sfo samp=3433502>
Underneath the bay?

<u who=G n=79>
<sfo samp=3459702>
Underneath the concealed hideout.

<u who=F n=80>
<sfo samp=3493901>
No I'm not. ... I'm right {ab|be} ... I'm at the west ... I'm at the
west ... I'm right at {le|c} in {ci|concealed}.

<u who=G n=81>
<sfo samp=3612701>
Okay.  No, scratch that.  Go up ... to where, you know, you first made
the jog west.  You need to go around to the east.

<u who=F n=82>
<sfo samp=3785502>
I need to go all the way around it?

<u who=G n=83>
<sfo samp=3814702>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=84>
<sfo samp=3822502>
And come out at where it ... At the {le|c}?

<u who=G n=85>
<sfo samp=3864502>
That's right but go with ... go the ... go around it east, coming
west.

<u who=F n=86>
<sfo samp=3978102>
How can you go around something east, going west, Dave?

<u who=G n=87>
<sfo samp=4041502>
Just go around to the right-hand side.

<u who=F n=88>
<sfo samp=4085502>
Done.

<u who=G n=89>
<sfo samp=4099702>
Okay, {fp|uh} do you have the boathouse?

<u who=F n=90>
<sfo samp=4153702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=91>
<sfo samp=4169502>
Okay, {fp|uh} hang a {ab|s} ... go directly south at the boathouse ...

<u who=F n=92>
<sfo samp=4267502>
From the ... From the {le|c} in {ci|concealed}?

<u who=G n=93>
<sfo samp=4301702>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=94>
<sfo samp=4320302>
So I got to go back around?

<u who=G n=95>
<sfo samp=4369702>
Okay, we're really screwing this up.

<u who=F n=96>
<sfo samp=4406102>
Just keep going!  I got to go around the boathouse ...

<u who=G n=97>
<sfo samp=4481702>
Okay right, you're east of the boathouse, right?

<u who=F n=98>
<sfo samp=4530901>
No, I'm west of the boathouse.

<u who=G n=99>
<sfo samp=4561902>
You're west of the boathouse!

<u who=F n=100>
<sfo samp=4582302>
The {ab|conceal} ... the concealed {fp|uh} hideout is four fingers
north ... of the boathouse.

<u who=G n=101>
<sfo samp=4688901>
Okay, we're looking at two different boathouses.  There's another
boathouse directly underneath that.

<u who=F n=102>
<sfo samp=4766902>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=103>
<sfo samp=4781302>
Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ...

<u who=F n=104>
<sfo samp=4899102>
<bo id=o54i>
Hurry!

<u who=G n=105>
<sfo samp=4901302>
The {ab|d} ... Do you see the ... the point ...
<eo id=o54i>

<u who=F n=106>
<sfo samp=4967102>
<bo id=o54j>
Yeah, I got the point in the bay right here.  I got it.

<u who=G n=107>
<sfo samp=4996702>
That's east.  Go two fingers up on that ...
<eo id=o54j>

<u who=F n=108>
<sfo samp=5048102>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=109>
<sfo samp=5062302>
Okay?  Make your turn there coming straight south and follow crane
bay ...

<u who=F n=110>
<sfo samp=5140102>
{ip|Kay=Okay}.  So you just ... There's a little boathouse in there
that you don't want me to hit?

<u who=G n=111>
<sfo samp=5223701>
That's right.

<u who=F n=112>
<sfo samp=5235502>
<bo id=o54k>
Okay, now I'm following the bay.

<u who=G n=113>
<sfo samp=5264502>
{ab|Oka} ...
<eo id=o54k>

<u who=F n=114>
<sfo samp=5265302>
Where are we going now, Dave?

<u who=G n=115>
<sfo samp=5284102>
Do you have the coconut palm?

<u who=F n=116>
<sfo samp=5308901>
{ph|Nno=No}, I got {fp|uh} stones ... {fp|uh} {ab|sh} washed stones
and pebbled shore.

<u who=G n=117>
<sfo samp=5404901>
Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ... go to ... follow crane
bay and go up over top pebbled shore, stay close to pebbled shore.

<u who=F n=118>
<sfo samp=5610701>
So keep following it {ip|til=until} I get to pebbled shore?

<u who=G n=119>
<sfo samp=5656302>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=120>
<sfo samp=5674502>
Okay, I'm I'm staying really close to pebbled shore.

<u who=G n=121>
<sfo samp=5728701>
Okay, go up and around it ... up to your left ...

<u who=F n=122>
<sfo samp=5822102>
To my left?

<u who=G n=123>
<sfo samp=5842302>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=124>
<sfo samp=5859302>
Why, what's there?

<u who=G n=125>
<sfo samp=5888701>
Well, {ip|cause=because} you want to go around it, up top, that way.

<u who=F n=126>
<sfo samp=5952302>
<event desc="Follower blows as if to say that it's hard work">
Okay, there's {ab|someth} ... What's in the middle of your map, Dave?

<u who=G n=127>
<sfo samp=6022302>
Okay, {br|wh what=what} you're avoiding is a coconut palm that you
don't have.
<event desc="wheezes">

<u who=F n=128>
<sfo samp=6099502>
Yeah, but I can go in between it, right?

<u who=G n=129>

<bo id=o54l>
Yeah, that's what you want to do.  So it's ...

<u who=F n=130>
<sfo samp=6152102>
All right.  So I'm I'm in between it, so now where am I?  I'm at the
{le|p} in the {ci|{ab|p}} {fp|uh} {ci|pebbled}.
<eo id=o54l>

<u who=G n=131>
<sfo samp=6225102>
Okay.  You have something underneath pebbled shore?

<u who=F n=132>
<sfo samp=6259901>
Yeah, I got to go in between it?

<u who=G n=133>
<sfo samp=6288302>
No, go around it further to the left ...

<u who=F n=134>
<sfo samp=6361702>
Right.

<u who=G n=135>
<sfo samp=6377102>
Okay?  Now ... {ab|f} continue the loop around, and you see the
flagship?

<u who=F n=136>
<sfo samp=6486702>
Yeah.

<u who=G n=137>
<sfo samp=6525701>
<bo id=o54m>
About one and a half fingers directly west of the bow of the ship,
mark an {le|x}.

<u who=F n=138>
<sfo samp=6632102>
The bow is {ph|theee=the} front?
<eo id=o54m>

<u who=G n=139>
<sfo samp=6662102>
Yeah.

<u who=F n=140>
<sfo samp=6694901>
Okay.  Right at the tip of the ... the little bay?

<u who=G n=141>
<sfo samp=6776702>
Yeah, exactly.  Mark an {le|x} there.
