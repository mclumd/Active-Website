==G: Can we go, Steve?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Uh}, we're starting from above the missionary camp.<br>
==F: Yeah.  Got it.<br>
==G: Do you have that?  Okay, what I want you to do is proceed ... west, to the {ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} northwest corner of the missionary camp.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Do you have anything right beside the missionary camp?<br>
==F: I have a banana tree off to the far west.<br>
==G: Off to the far west?  How far?  Is it right beside the missionary camp or there's a gap?<br>
==F: It's {ip|bout=about} {fp|uh} ... two ... two fingers from half page, west.<br>
==G: Okay.  Okay what I want you to do is go along ... south, down past the missionary camp ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: {ab|S} So you're even with it, though.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And proceed to the bottom of that ... I believe you have a banana bush.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Or whatever.<br>
==F: A {ab|bana} ...<br>
==G: I've got gorillas.  Do you have gorillas?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Okay.  I I think gorillas and banana bush are sharing the same thing here.  So proceed west to that ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: to the far southwest corner ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: of your bananas ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And what I want you to do is ... now proceed north ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Do you have a rope bridge?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay, what I want you to do is curve up above, to the {fp|uh} west side of the rope bridge ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now join to the other side of the rope bridge now, the east part.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have anything beside that?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, I have a waterfall to the far, far east.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to ... just go down a bit, go {fp|uh} ... south, down past the the rope bridge, once you get off it ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ab|ju} just about one finger width.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  And then proceed to the bottom ... the {fp|uh} southwest tip of the waterfall ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Above the waterfall, on the west side, do you have some lost steps?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Do you have anything there?<br>
==F: I don't have anything.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: What I want you to do is, start moving north ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: up the waterfall, up the west side of the waterfall ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: about ... one finger length.  Do you have any fallen pillars?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} off to the {ab|f} west, I do.<br>
==G: {ab|A} Above the {ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} rope bridge, more or less?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to head for the northernmost {fp|uh} ... northeastern tip of the fallen pillars ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and then go below them.  And end up at the ... southwest tip.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything ... {ab|l} let's see {fp|uh}, southwest of that?<br>
==F: {ab|Y} ...<br>
==G: Of the fallen pillars?<br>
==F: Yes I do, I have {fp|uh} flamingoes.<br>
==G: Okay, I don't have any flamingoes, so what I want you to do is curl around the ... {fp|um} ... southeastern tip of the flamingoes ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and come up to the ... northwestern side.<br>
==F: All right.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay?  So you've gone almost all the way around them.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have any ancient ruins above that?<br>
==F: I have a ruined city.<br>
==G: Ruined city?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, is that about one quarter down the page?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, I want you to head for the ... {fp|um} ... let's see, northwestern tip of that ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  And stop there.  Now, do you have any stones up above that?<br>
==F: I have a rock fall off to the {fp|uh} ... north ... north northeast ... of it.<br>
==G: To the north northeast?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Approximately half a finger.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Um}, what I want you to do is from the ancient ruins, just head straight north.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: {ip|Til=Until} you're about {ab|th} ... half a finger down from the top of the page.  Do you now have a white mountain off to the east?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  Head for the north {ab|w} ... {fp|um} sorry, the southwest tip of that mountain ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now proceed over top of the mountain and down to the ... {fp|um} southeast side ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Below this mountain, do you have the biggest furniture store?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is go right under the mountain to just right below it and head west ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: under the mountain ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You're ... You're going to pass in between the mountain and my biggest furniture store ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And stop at the ... {ab|n} ... where you started touching the mountain but dropped a bit.<br>
==F: {gg|Oh}, all right.<br>
==G: Okay?  {fp|Um}, do you have any gazelles?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, right to the {ab|d} south, I do.<br>
==G: To the south?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Head south to the gazelles ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: To the {fp|um} southwestern point of the gazelles ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And then turn east ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Go about half a finger east of the gazelles ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And that's our finish point.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==G: Start!  Northwest of the diamond mine ... You've got the start marked, I guess?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You proceed ... southwest one finger, then southerly about three and a half fingers, and pass eastward, on the southern border of the diamond mine.<br>
==F: Okay, I don't ... okay, so eastward you want to go?<br>
==G: {gg|Oh}, do you have the diamond mine?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {gg|Oh}, okay.<br>
==F: Okay, from the start point you want me to go where? Come {ph|chmm} south?<br>
==G: Yes.<br>
==F: Southwest, right?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {ab|O}<br>
==G: Well you're really just doing a loop around the diamond mine ...<br>
==F: Okay.  Okay.<br>
==G: counter-clockwise. And you come off near the {le|e} of the word {ci|diamond mine}, heading east northeast towards ... the rift valley.<br>
==F: Okay, where do you want me to stop there?<br>
==G: Well, you better stop about half way towards the word {ci|rift}.  Have you got the wagon wheel marked in there?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  On your ... north side as you're heading towards the rift valley, about half way from the word {ci|diamond mine} to the middle of the rift valley ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: there's a small wagon wheel on your north side.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
<a name="0">-2G: So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed ... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading northerly or {ab|eith} even slightly west of north, going up the east side of that wagon wheel.<br>
-1F: Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?<br>
<b>-0G: No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...<br>
</b>+1F: You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...<br>
+2G: Towards ...<br>
==F: middle of the {ab|ri} ...<br>
==G: Half way towards the rift valley.<br>
==F: {gg|Oh}, okay, half way.  All right.<br>
==G: Yeah, the wagon wheel's half way, and you just ... make a left turn around the far side or the east side of that wagon wheel.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you're passing ... on the south side of this wagon wheel, and you curve ... counter-clockwise to your left, as you go past it, so you're actually heading north {ab|a} after you've passed the east side of the wagon wheel.  It's just a big {le|s} you're doing.  And then, after you're about a finger north of the wagon wheel, you cut back to the right or the northeast, and then you go over the top of the rift valley and right down the middle ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: of the rift valley heading south southwards right down the middle of the rift valley.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you go above it and then it's just like you're going for a swim in a pool.<br>
==F: So I I'm on the east side of the cactus now?<br>
==G: {fg|Er}, I don't have a cactus marked, but probably the cactus is, what, southwest of the rift valley?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Yeah, just ignore the cactus.  You're going due south from the very centre of the rift valley ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: about four fingers<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you probably miss the cactus.  Then, after going about ... Have you got rocks?  South of the rift valley?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  About ...<br>
==F: I'm right above them, right now.<br>
==G: Yeah, okay, well sixty per cent of the way from the rift valley to the rocks, you change your course and start heading ... southwest.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you miss the rocks by about one finger.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
<a name="1">-2G: And you then can proceed about four fingers past the rocks, so that you're now {ab|w} ... {ab|s} west southwest of the rocks about three or four fingers.  On your north side there should be a stone creek.<br>
-1F: No.  Don't have it.<br>
<b>-0G: No stone creek.  Well it's there, and what you do ...<br>
</b>+1F: {gg|Oh} Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!<br>
+2G: {gg|Oh}.<br>
==F: It's {fp|er} ... south west from the rocks, way down.<br>
==G: {gg|Oh} {ab|tha} that'll be a different one.  Yeah, {gg|oh} that's away down.  That's a different stone creek.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: There's one stone creek ... due west of the rocks about four fingers.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ab|An} {ab|An} And after heading south from the rift valley and then heading southwesterly, you pass ... south of this stone creek which is four fingers due west of the rocks ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then you ... curve to your right or to ... the north ... west northwest, let's say.  Do you have the white water ... marked?<br>
==F: I just have rapids.<br>
==G: Rapids.  It's probably the same.<br>
==F: {gg|Mmm}.<br>
==G: And this is about five or six fingers south of the diamond mine?<br>
==F: Diamond mines? Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  You pass ... {ab|ac} above the north side of {ab|tha} those rapids.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you're heading ... west northwest at the time.  Do you have a swamp marked?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
<a name="2">-2G: Well, you're heading toward the swamp, but you don't go anyplace near the swamp, you cut a sharp left, heading south west and then south, around that white water, so you're actually passing counter-clockwise around the white water or the rapids.<br>
-1F: Okay.  So am I going to go east, again?<br>
<b>-0G: No ...<br>
</b>+1F: Past ... No?<br>
+2G: you're then going to go south.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: After passing the rapids you head south about five or six fingers.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And then you ...<br>
==F: I should be right beside a manned fort.<br>
==G: You know I don't have the manned fort, but what I think you'll be doing is passing west of the fort as you're heading southerly.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And ... Do you have the stone slabs marked?<br>
==F: Yeah.  They're {fp|uh} ...<br>
==G: Northeast of the stone creek?  The lower stone creek?<br>
==F: They're south ... Yeah!  {ab|Th} That's right.<br>
==G: And they're southwest of the outlaws' hideout?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well, heading toward the stone creek, the lower stone creek, you curve to the east northeast, towards the outlaws' hideout.  So you've ...<br>
==F: So I should be going around the manned fort, then?<br>
==G: Yes, you're probably going around the manned fort.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you head right up to the south side of the outlaws' hideout and you hang a right and you curve southwards then ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: having missed the south side of the outlaws' hideout by about a half finger.<br>
==F: So I ... I'm coming down to a gold mine.<br>
==G: Yeah, you're probably going around the gold mine, then ... {ip|cause=because} you head straight down the right-hand side of the page, and around the noose, you're passing to the east of the noose.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You then ... curve ... to the south west after you pass the east side of the noose.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And go about three fingers.  And then, dead ahead of you is a little swan pond, which is about one finger high and three fingers wide.<br>
==F: I don't have that, I have a a saloon bar?<br>
==G: You'll get there later.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: It's about half way from the noose to the saloon bar.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then you skirt the swan pond on the north side by dipping up about half ... about one finger, then west about three fingers, and then southwest about one finger.  So you just bypass this swan pond.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then you continue on to the south side of the saloon bar.<br>
==F: South side, okay.<br>
==G: And then you just have a slow arc {fp|uh} that takes you past the saloon bar and up to the northeast, about three and a half fingers, where you finish.<br>
==F: So I should be coming ... down? Okay, okay.<br>
==G: {fg|Uh}, what you're doing is a big circle.  The centre of the circle is the stone creek, and the the course you're following takes you past the saloon bar on the south side, so it's just a big arc from the swan pond, below the saloon bar and then up to the northwest to your finish.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you're about three inches from the ... southwest corner of the saloon bar when you finish.  And you're heading northwest or or north northwest at that point.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: That's it.<br>
==F: Done!<br>
==G: Okay, Richard.  We're going to start off.  Do you have an east lake in the ... northeast corner?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Of your map?  Right.  There's the ... Do you see the ... ... the northwest point of {ab|th} east lake?<br>
==F: Northwest point of east lake?<br>
==G: Yeah.  The highest northwest point.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then directly below that is the ... southwest corner ... of east lake?<br>
==F: Straight down?  The southwest?  Yeah.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay, well just ... just a little {br|pa ast=past} a a little west of that corner is your {ab|f} ... {fg|Oh}, well, that'll be your finish {fg|eh}? I'm looking at the wrong spot!  Okay. Do you have a ... train crossing at the ... {br|north west=northwest} corner of your page?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well, if you go directly south, {ph|fffar=far} down south, do you have a {ph|ssssite=site} of ... {ph|ffforest=forest} fire?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Right above, in the centre of the {ab|s} ... site of forest fire ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I got the start.<br>
==G: Okay ... {gg|Oh}!  All right. ... Okay, so now you're going to go ... to the left-hand side ... of the forest fire site ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
<a name="3">-2G: and go ... straight down south.<br>
-1F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?<br>
<b>-0G: No.  No.  Go west.<br>
</b>+1F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
==F: And then straight south?<br>
==G: Straight south.  Do you have a picnic site?  South of the site of the forest fire?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, then.  On the far right corner of your page do you have a farm ground?  Farmyard, sorry.<br>
==F: Yeah.  On the far right, bottom right.<br>
==G: Okay.  So then, at the bottom ... Okay.  As you've {ab|go} ... You've gone straight down south from the forest fire site?<br>
==F: Yeah, but I'm on basically the southwest corner of the forest fire.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go ... Keep going straight down {ip|til=until} {ab|yo} ...<br>
==F: Keep ... Straight down?  How far?<br>
==G: until your line's {ph|beloooow=below} the farmyard ... just in line with that.<br>

==G: towards {ab|far} ... the farmyard ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then go straight up {ab|n} north ...<br>
==F: When do I head north?<br>
==G: {ph|Buz} So that you'll come up along the west side of the adventure playground.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  The the west side, okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit {br|north east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ...<br>

<a name="4">-2G: until you come to in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your stopping point would be {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south} west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You see that, way up there?  But you're still {ab|s} ...<br>

==G: Okay.  You've gone straight up ... the west side of the adventure playground ...<br>
==F: Yeah.  And then start curving northeast?<br>
==G: Now {ab|s} ... Yes.<br>
==F: Okay.  And then ...<br>
==G: Until you're in line ... with the ... southwest corner of east lake. Just so that you're in line.  Don't go up or anything.  {ab|J} ...<br>
==F: Okay.  So basically, east lake ... {ab|w} I'll stop at this point {fp|er} east lake, that southwest corner'll be north of me?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Directly north of you.  Right.  Okay, now you're going to go straight up. Do you have a {ab|d} {fp|er} granite quarry?<br>

==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You see that remote village?<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: Right, okay, well then, doesn't matter.  That's where we'll finish.  Right. Do you have {fp|uh} ... crest falls at the bottom of your page?<br>
==F: Yeah, I've got the start.<br>
==G: Okay.  Right there, then.  Okay, start there ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: and curve around the west side ...<br>
==F: The west ...<br>
==G: so that you're ... you're going south ... Go west for ... at crest falls and go down along the side of crest falls to the south ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: and curve so that you're going ... in line with the word {ci|crest falls}?  Go straight west.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how far?<br>
==G: Keep going until ... Do you have {ab|balloo} ... {gg|Oh}, or, sorry, baboons?  In {ab|th} ... north ...<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: on the {br|north west=northwest} part of your sheet?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have {fp|uh} ... white mountain?<br>
==F: I've got ...<br>
==G: Way up north on your sheet?<br>
==F: I've got ... Yeah I've got a white mountain right next to the remote village.<br>
==G: {fg|Oh}, okay, right.  Well ... from that that line going straight from crest falls ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to curve a line up ... so that you're heading in the direction of the {le|w} in {ci|white mountain}.  Past the {le|w}, actually, in {ci|white mountain}.  Almost the edge, of the west side of white mountain.<br>
==F: Okay, so from the crest falls ...<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: I go ... Basically, from the start, I go ... west, then go on the west side, go south?<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: {ip|Til=Until} I'm in line with the word {ci|crest falls}?<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: Then go west.  How far do I go west?<br>
==G: Keep going west until you're at the ... edge of white mountain.  You see where the edge of the bottom of it is?<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ab|th} ... Just the edge of the mountain itself?  Okay.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay, and then curve up and make like a circle.  Do you have a footbridge?<br>
==F: I've got a footbridge which is northwest of crest falls.<br>
==G: That's right.  Okay, you're going to come up and circle around and cross over that footbridge.<br>
==F: Okay, so basically I go west and I go ... curve towards the white mountain?<br>
==G: Curve north.  Curve north ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: and then you're curving back east over the footbridge.<br>
==F: Do I go {ab|d} over it or {ab|un} ... Over the top?<br>
==G: Over it, right over it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and then right as you ... soon as you get off the footbridge ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: go ... Do you have a poison stream there?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, I've got a poison stream which is northwest ... northeast of the remote village.<br>
==G: Okay, don't worry about that, then.  I have one of those too.  Okay, as soon as you get off the footbridge, then, right at the edge of the footbridge, head south ...<br>
==F: Right at the edge, okay.  So head south at the east edge?<br>
==G: Yeah, and then ... to between ... Do you have a ... where it says {ci|start}?  Just {fp|uh} a little bit up from there, go ... You know where it says {ci|start}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, take your south line ... Do you have an old temple?<br>
==F: Yeah, I got an old temple.<br>
==G: Okay, well, take your ... your line south off the footbridge, then.<br>
==F: Okay, so ... Hang on!  I go on the footbridge ...<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: and then on the east side I go south?<br>
==G: Yes.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how far south?<br>
==G: Right south, right away.<br>
==F: How far south, though?<br>
==G: Halfway between ... the word {ci|footbridge} and {ci|start}.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay, and then curve up so that you come up along the west side of old temple ...<br>
==F: So {ph|basicalleee=basically}, curve up?<br>
==G: Yeah, curving up ...<br>
==F: So you {ab|wa} ...<br>
==G: right up ...<br>
==F: Go east and then curve up over the ... old temple, you mean?<br>
==G: Right.  On the west side of it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  And then you're going to come up in a {ph|biiig=big} arcing circle, going north ... so that you're ... {gg|Oh}, how do I say that? Do you have an abandoned truck?<br>
==F: I have an abandoned truck which is south of white mountain?<br>
==G: West ... {ab|I} It's north ... It would be north of the footbridge?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, well, as you come up the west side of the old temple ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: make a big arc so that you're half the distance between the abandoned truck and your remote village ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, half the distance between the abandoned truck and remote village?<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: Arc there, okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  So ... And then circle down and head southwest so that you come straight under the abandoned truck.<br>
==F: Okay.  {fp|Uh} ... so ...<br>
==G: Then when you get to the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned} ...<br>
==F: {fp|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: curve south ...<br>
==F: Okay, so curve {ab|s} ... Okay, so basically, I curve ...<br>
==G: Curve south.  {ab|Ju} ... Go south.<br>
==F: Curve and then go around the bottom?  Of ... abandoned truck?<br>
==G: In the {le|a} ... From the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned truck}, go south.<br>
==F: Go south.  Straight south?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Just go straight south.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: How far?<br>
==G: You're going to go as far as ... Count the rings on the temple, there's one, two, three, four, five, six ... I have seven rings, right to the top ...<br>
==F: One.  Two, three, four, five, six, seven {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: and you're going to go west at about the second ring ... from the bottom.<br>
==F: From the top or the bottom?<br>
==G: Pardon me?<br>
==F: From the top?<br>
==G: From the bottom of the old temple.<br>
==F: Okay, so the second from the bottom.<br>
==G: That's the height level, yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ip|cause=because} you have to go around baboons, I have baboons.<br>
==F: So I go south of abandoned truck from the {ab|cor} ... the southwest corner of abandoned truck?<br>
==G: Yeah.  From the word ...<br>
==F: And then go west?  At the second ring of the temple.<br>
==G: Yeah, and head west.<br>
==F: Okay, how far?<br>
==G: Do you have anything else {fp|uh} ...<br>
==F: I've got nothing west of abandoned truck.<br>
==G: Okay, then, make a curve ... farther out than the {ab|o} ... the first big curve you made ...<br>
==F: Okay, then ... The the first one, basically, after crest falls, you mean?<br>
==G: Yeah, that big curve you made first?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and then ...<br>
==F: Further out?  How high, though?<br>
==G: {fg|Oh}, not ... not high.  Just ... Make the curve about the same size as the abandoned truck, actually.<br>
==F: So, okay, so basically half ...<br>
==G: From the old temple, from the second ring, you're going to make a curve the size of the abandoned truck ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: so that you're going west and then you're going to go north ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: towards white mountain ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Come all the {ab|w} ... Come all the way up north along the west face of white mountain.<br>
==F: Okay, so you want me to curve around it and then go ... Do I go ... curve towards the white mountain?<br>
==G: Yeah.  You made a big curve and then you're going to go on an angle of probably ... {ab|north} northeast ...<br>
==F: Northeast, okay.<br>
==G: towards ... Go up the face of white mountain, the west side.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how {ab|fa} ... Okay yeah, I go up the face of the west side?<br>
==G: Okay, and then go ... As you're going up the {ab|w} ... the west face, go straight up ... Do you have a pyramid at the top of your page?<br>
==F: I've got a pyramid at the {ab|to} ... the {br|north east=northeast} {ab|cor} ...<br>
==G: Okay, well, go ... Keep going north from the tip of white mountain, go straight north ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: until you're in line with the bottom of the pyramid, and then head east ... Right?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Curve up all the way up and around right down underneath the bottom of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: So I curve ... {ab|bel} ...<br>
==G: Curve all the way around the pyramid, go right around it ...<br>
==F: Below?<br>
==G: like you're making a pyramid yourself.<br>
==F: Okay, below the pyramid or above it?<br>
==G: Right up above it ...<br>
==F: Okay, above it.<br>
==G: down the east side and across the bottom.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So that you're heading west again.<br>
==F: All right.  Got it.<br>
==G: Right then, do you have a ... cobbled street?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, well then, at the {ab|b} ... southwest corner of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: go south ...<br>
==F: Go south, okay.<br>
==G: come ... curve around the bottom of the remote village ...<br>
==F: Curve around the bottom?  Or ...<br>
==G: Yeah.  Come all the way down south and curve around the bottom of the remote village ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: and just past the remote village, you finish.<br>
==F: Okay, so I'm going to curve ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, so, basically, come down on the west side of remote village and go east?<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I go east and {br|h how=how} far?<br>
==G: Just past it, make and {le|x}.<br>
==F: Just past, okay.<br>
==G: and you have your finish.  Okay?<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: That's it.<br>
==G: Are you ready, steve?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, our starting point is at the site of the forest fire.<br>
==F: Yeah, got it.<br>
==G: Okay.  What you're going to do is you're going to move to the west side of the forest fire.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And start moving south.  Down.  Do you have a picnic site just below the forest fire?<br>
==F: I have a ... No I don't.  I have an adventure playground, right to the {fp|uh} ... {ab|s} ...<br>
==G: Okay, okay.  Have that too.<br>
==F: {gg|Oh}.<br>
==G: Right below the forest fire, I have a picnic site.  So what you're going to do is you're going to head, {fp|uh} sorry, south, down ... around the west side of my picnic site ... and start east and then come up between that and the adventure playground.  So I want you to end up on the ... northwest corner of the adventure playground.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I go on the east side of ... or I go on the west side of the forest fire?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Straight down.  Imagine that there is a picnic site just below there.<br>
==F: Yeah, all right.<br>
==G: Okay?  {ab|S} So you're going to go around that.  And you're going to end up at the {fp|uh} ... {ab|n} northwest corner of the playground.<br>
==F: All right, I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... for ... two finger lengths, I want you to head east.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have anything east of the adventure playground?<br>
==F: I have a ...<br>
==G: Up a bit?<br>
==F: I have a ... privately owned field.<br>
==G: Okay, I don't have that.  What you're going to do is you're going to go underneath that field ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And you're going to stop at the {fp|uh}, let's see {fp|uh}, southeastern tip of that ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now, do you have a {ph|go} ... granite quarry, above that?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, directly to the north I do, yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now what I want you to do is from that {fp|um} ... southeastern tip, is go up to the ... {ab|g} go north to the northeastern tip of the granite quarry.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Now what you're going to do is you're going to go over top of the quarry, and end up on the ... northwestern tip.<br>
==F: All right, I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now to the {fp|uh} ... southwest, do you have a {fp|uh} train crossing?<br>
==F: I have nothing, to the southwest.<br>
==G: Okay, I ... {fp|Uh}, do you have a waterfall?<br>
==F: I have a waterfall to the {br|ea east=east} ... or to the west, yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to {fp|um} ... From your point {ab|d} ... on the {fp|um} northwest corner of the granite quarry ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: dip down to {ph|thee=the} ... southwest tip ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And head to {ph|thee=the} ... southwest corner of the waterfall.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now head north up the west side of the waterfall ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Head east along the top of the waterfall until you get to the {fp|uh} ... northeast tip ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Do you have anything to the {fp|uh} northeast there?<br>
==F: I have a ... sign there, yeah.<br>
==G: A sign?<br>
==F: A public {ph|totepath=footpath} or something like that.<br>
==G: Okay.  I don't have anything there.  So what I want you to do is head directly north from that {fp|um} ... from {ph|thee=the} ... {fp|uh} northeastern tip of the waterfall ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: for about {fp|um} half a finger length ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, now from that point, do you have ... let's see {fp|uh} ... southeast ... {fp|uh} fallen cairn?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, way off to the far east I do, yes.<br>
==G: Okay, I want you to head for that.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: {ab|Hea} ... Head for the {fp|uh} ... {ab|n} {fp|uh} ... southwestern tip.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now come around that ... to {ph|thee=the} northeastern tip ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Do you have {ph|limefstone=limestone} cliffs above you?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no I don't.<br>
==G: Do you have the east lake?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, what you're going to do now is head for {ph|thee=the} ... See the {le|a} in {ci|lake}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, {ab|g} ... Follow that straight down and head for that point. {ab|A} At the {fp|uh} ... the ... the edge of the lake there.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Now you're going to head east ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have cornfields there?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} ... to my west, I do.<br>
==G: Yeah, {gg|oh} {ab|s} {ab|s} sorry, west.  {ab|N} Not east. {ab|Di} Disregard that.  Head west.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do ... Do you have cornfields there?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay, right in between east lake and the cornfield, put an {le|x} and that's where the finish is.<br>
==G: All right.  Have you got the {fp|uh} start marked {fp|uh} Mike, on the lower right-hand corner on the top of crest falls?<br>
==F: Yeah.  It's {fp|uh} just above the crest falls.<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay. Well, {fp|ehm}, since it's easy to draw lines where they're not going to have to be, shortly thereafter, when you discover there's something there that you didn't know about, I'm going to mention a few of the obstacles that we're going to ... be going around and you can mark them in ahead of time and ... and then we'll draw the line.  {fp|Uh}, do you have a footbridge in about {fp|uh} five fingers northwest of the falls?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have the poisoned stream immediately east of the footbridge?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  About one finger-width away from the footbridge, and with the same northerly boundary but going down about one finger, {fp|uh} {ab|d} in a southerly direction there's going to be a poisoned stream.  It's just an obstacle that we're going to have to go around.<br>
==F: {ab|Oka} ... Do you have a banana tree there?<br>
<a name="7">-2G: {fp|Uh}, a banana tree?<br>
-1F: Yeah.<br>
<b>-0G: No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?<br>
</b>+1F: That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.<br>
+2G: Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at one point.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, do you have the old temple to the east of the footbridge?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have the abandoned truck, north of the footbridge?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have the hill with baboons on it, southwest of the abandoned truck?<br>
==F: {ph|Nnnno=No}.<br>
==G: Okay, about three fingers southwest of the abandoned truck, there's a hill with baboons on it.  It's just called baboons.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: It's about the same size as the abandoned truck.  Do you have white mountain north of the abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have the pyramid, northeast of white mountain?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have the cobbled street, south of the pyramid?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: South of the pyramid, there's a remote village.<br>
==G: All right.  In between the pyramid and the remote village, about {fp|uh} ... forty per cent of the way down from the pyramid to the remote village, and directly above the remote village in terms of east-west, there's a cobbled street with a street lamp on it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: We're going to be jogging around that later.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And that's about all you need to to watch out for.  Okay, we start ... above the crest falls, go west ... about a finger and a half, and then curve southwards so we're just going around the north west {fp|uh} margin of the crest falls heading {br|south westerly=southwesterly} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then, after we get even with the base of crest falls, we start heading westerly, and proceed westerly ... about {ph|ssssix=six} or eight fingers, so that we're about two-thirds or three-quarters of the way towards the edge of the map.<br>
==F: Okay.  So I should be ...<br>
==G: Then we arc ...<br>
==F: I should be coming right under the banana tree, then?<br>
==G: Right.  Okay, that's fine.  And then we arc ... We'll probably be going west of the banana tree and then north ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: We arc up to the north, a big right curve.  Go north, towards the baboon hill ...<br>
==F: Okay.  West side of the {ph|boom} ... baboon hill?<br>
==G: {fp|Uh} {ab|n} ... We don't get that far.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: We then continue arcing to the right, and head right on to that footbridge heading easterly, right into the west ... end of the footbridge and go right across the footbridge.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ab|W} ... As soon as we get across the footbridge we have to curve immediately southwards to avoid that poisoned stream.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: We go about two fingers south, and then we head immediately due east, passing on the south side of the poisoned stream.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading right to the old temple now.<br>
==G: {ab|R} ... That's correct.  We now arc to the left, a left turn going north, and we're heading due north as we pass the west side of the old temple, very close to the old temple as we head due north.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: We go about ... three {ab|f} or four fingers from the base of the old temple, that's about two fingers above the ... the north end of the old temple, and then we alter course to the north west, travel about three or four {ph|ff} ...<br>
==F: So, I'm going to be going up slate mountain, then?<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, you probably have a mountain in there.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: So we're probably going on the east and the northeast sides of slate {br|mou ntain=mountain}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then we get above the top of slate mountain ...<br>
==F: I should be ...<br>
==G: We head ...<br>
==F: right below remote village.<br>
==G: Remote village.  Correct.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, at that point we change course and head south west and pass ... east to west along the south side of the abandoned truck.<br>
==F: Okay.  So I should be, like, right above the baboons or whatever?<br>
==G: That's correct.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: About half a finger west of the southwest corner of the abandoned truck, you you turn south, and you now dip south, then west, and then north, right around the baboon hill.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And after you've finished passing the baboon hill on the west heading north, you'll go east ... or sorry, north northeast, and go right up to the west face of white mountain.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you {ab|par} ... go parallel to the west face of white mountain about a half a finger's ... width away from white mountain.  And when you get to the peak of white mountain, you then head due north.<br>
==F: So I'm going right up to lemon grew?<br>
==G: I would suppose so.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And when you get ... even with the base of the pyramid, in a north-southerly orientation, you make a ... sharp ... right ... turn, heading eastwards, towards the pyramid, but you're about one quarter of the way up the height of the pyramid at that point, not right at the base, but about one quarter of the way up.  And you head ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: east towards the pyramid, and when you get to the west face of the pyramid, you {ab|g} ... head north east and do the same thing that you did with the other mountains.  You go up to the peak of the pyramid and then down, southeast along the east face.  Of the pyramid.<br>
==F: So I'm just going up and around it?<br>
==G: Right, yeah.  You're just missing it by a half finger's width.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  When you get to the east side of the pyramid you swing ... to the south west, and then the west, and cross underneath the pyramid from east to west.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And when you get to the ...<br>
==F: So I'm in between the pyramid and ...<br>
==G: and the cobbled street.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, when you get to the {ab|m} line of the west side of the pyramid, you then head south southwest, and you pass on the west side of the cobbled street, the west side of the remote village, and then swing a ... a left turn or ... towards the east, and cross across west to east, on the south side of the remote village ...<br>
==F: So I'm coming ...<br>
==G: to your finish ... line, and the finish mark is about one finger east of the {le|e} of {ci|remote village}, the final {le|e} of {ci|village}, and about half a finger south of that {le|e}.<br>
==F: Where is it?  Where's the finish point?<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, half a finger south of the last {le|e} of village, and about one finger-width east of it.<br>
==F: Okay.  Okay.<br>
==G: That's it!<br>
==G: All right.  {fp|Er}, Steve, our our starting point is up in the burnt forest ...<br>
==F: Yeah.  I have it.<br>
==G: Okay.  Our {ab|f} ... I'll just tell you our finishing point, which will be ... Do you have a flagship at the bottom?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: right in front of the flagship.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  So that's where we're going to.  Okay.  This is how I want you to start.  I want you to start at the ... {fp|erm} ... let's see, the ... {br|north western=northwestern} edge of the burnt forest ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: What do you have below the burnt forest there?<br>
==F: I have a carpenter's cottage.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is head down the ... western side of the burnt forest ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and once again the western side of the carpenter's cottage ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Once you hit the {ab|n} the southernmost point of the carpenter's cottage I want you to ... make a a turn and head east ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Do you have a ravine?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to head between the carpenter's cottage and the ravine.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Above the ravine, do you have a remote village?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is head to the top ... the {fp|er} ... northernmost part of the ravine ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and keep heading east again ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now stop about one finger width past the ravine.  Do you have a pine grove to the {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to head to the ... {ab|n} {fp|er} ... {br|south western=southwestern} point of the {fp|er} pine grove ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything below that?<br>
==F: An avalanche?<br>
==G: Okay.  I don't have that.<br>
==F: And a concealed hideout?<br>
==G: {ph|Yyyou=You} have an avalanche and a concealed hideout?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now the concealed hideout is ... {ab|fur} {fp|er} southeast of the avalanche?<br>
==F: {fp|Er} ... it's pretty well directly south.<br>
==G: Pretty well directly south?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is ... go around the ... north {fp|er} eastern side of the avalanche ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and once again the northeastern side of the concealed hideout ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and once you get to the ... southeastern point of the hideout ... I want you to go west.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have a boathouse right there?<br>
==F: Directly south I do.<br>
==G: Directly south?<br>
==F: Directly south of the hideout.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, I I've got two boathouses.  Okay?  I've got one right ... Do you ... Do you have the the words {ci|crane bay} written in big on the bay there?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Right about where the {le|a} and the {le|n} are, in {ci|crane} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: if you go up one finger-length, I've got a boathouse there.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: That should be parallel to the concealed hideout.  Now what I want you to do is, from where I left you, head towards where that boathouse would be ... stop at the {fp|er} ... the {le|a} in {ci|bay} ... {ph|mm} {ph|w} like {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: parallel to that ...<br>
==F: Seen.  Yeah.<br>
==G: and just head straight south ... to the water's edge.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Now what you're going to do is follow crane bay around ... Do you ... Do you have a coconut palm?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  Follow it {ph|tooo=to} where the {le|c} is in {ci|crane} ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: and now start heading due west. Do you have a pebbled shore?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to be on the ... northern part of the pebbled shore, so just above it.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And then you're going to proceed down the western ... part of the pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have anything below the pebbled shore?<br>
==F: {fp|Er} washed stone.<br>
==G: Okay.  I want you to go around those stones ...<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, which side?  The east or west?<br>
==G: The western side.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And end up right at the finishing point, right in front of the flagship.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  There we go.<br>
==G: Start! Have you got a {br|c amera=camera} shop marked, in the lower left-hand quadrant?<br>
==F: Yeah.  That's right below start.  Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Have you got a parked van about three fingers' breadth ...<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: due south?  Of the camera shop?<br>
==F: I have a parked van but it's way up to the north.<br>
==G: {gg|Oh} yeah, I got one up at the top.  That's a different one.<br>
==F: Yeah.  That's the only parked van I have.<br>
==G: Well, you could probably pop in another parked van.<br>
==F: Okay.  Where is it located?<br>
==G: It's about {fp|uh} ... There'd be a gap of about {fp|uh} two and a half to three fingers' breadths.  Otherwise it looks the same, same orientation, but it's south of the camera shop.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: About two and a half fingers' width of space between the two.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Have you got the allotments, to the east southeast of the camera shop?<br>
==F: Yeah.  That would sort of be in the middle of the van and the camera shop, wouldn't it?<br>
<a name="8">-2G: {gg|Mmm}?<br>
-1F: That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...<br>
<b>-0G: {fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van is due south of the camera shop.<br>
</b>+1F: Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the middle of them.<br>
+2G: Bring the van over?<br>
==F: No.  The {fp|uh} alloitments in between the camera shop and the van?<br>
==G: {gg|Oh}!  Well, yeah, these allotments are at least a finger's breadth away from the camera shop and about a finger's breadth below it. The parked van's about three fingers below it.<br>
==F: Okay, all right.<br>
==G: Due south.  So I might as well just get started.  You start there, go to the west, or south west about one finger's width, and then veer {ab|st} straight south, passing down the west side of the camera shop, as you go south.<br>
==F: Okay, am I going to pass the van?<br>
==G: Go right down to the front of the van and underneath it, and cross from west to east under the south side of the parked van.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you swing north.  As soon as you get to the back end of the van you go due north, so you're heading up just eastwards of the camera shop but westwards of the allotments on the west side of the allotments.  And you just skirt the allotments, and then you immediately alter course, to the east northeast.  So you're going to pass on the northerly side of the allotments as you head east northeast.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: You go about two thirds the width of the page and then make a sharp northerly turn.  Then you're going due north.  You've probably got something marked there that you're making a corner turn around.<br>
==F: What is that?  The abandoned ...<br>
==G: Doesn't really matter, but ...<br>
==F: monastery?<br>
==G: There's probably some ... object.  Have you got an abandoned monastery?<br>
==F: Yeah.  So, am am I going up towards there?<br>
==G: You will be going up to it, and you'll be passing over the north side of the abandoned monastery from east ...<br>
==F: Okay, so I have ... I have to curve ... I have to go up with the lake lake, then, right?<br>
<a name="9">-2G: {fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand side or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something in between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five fingers' breadth ...<br>
-1F: Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?<br>
<b>-0G: {fg|Oh}.  No. You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't have west lake.<br>
</b>+1F: Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.<br>
+2G: Okay.  Well ...<br>
==F: And it's about ...<br>
==G: It'll be inside the big loop that you're making.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
<a name="10">-2G: But you just go a straight line, east northeast from the north west corner of the allotments.  Take it about eight fingers' breadth and that's where you then go due north to meet the {ab|r} east side of the abandoned monastery.<br>
-1F: Okay.  D'you have a flight museum?<br>
<b>-0G: No.<br>
</b>+1F: No, okay.  So I'm right at the {fp|uh} southeast corner ...<br>
+2G: of the abandoned monastery.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, now you just make a ... a crescent-shaped arc, over top of the abandoned monastery, you're heading northwest, then west, then southwest, just to go right around the abandoned monastery, and you're on, then {ph|on-nn=on} the west southwest corner of the abandoned monastery ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: having passed it on the north side of it.  Now there's ... Do you have {ph|aaa=a} youth hostel, south of the parked van at the top?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, an alpine garden?<br>
==F: Yeah, that's further down, though.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: It's just up to the {fp|uh} northwest of the abandoned monastery.<br>
==G: Right.  Well, northeast of the alpine garden, and south of the parked van at the top, about equidistant between those two objects, is a youth hostel.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Might as well just throw it in, just a little house.<br>
==F: D'you have a ... a {ph|levver} crossing? thing's this? level crossing?<br>
==G: Level crossing?  Like railroad?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Well, it's not a railroad.  It's ... looks like a ... a gate, sort of.<br>
==G: {fg|Oh}.  Well, we don't have that one here.  {fp|Uh} ...<br>
==F: It's directly below the east lake.<br>
==G: {gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you ... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to the point where you head north ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.<br>
==F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...<br>
<a name="11">-2G: Sure.<br>
-1F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?<br>
<b>-0G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.<br>
</b>+1F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ab|Y} ... Up the west side, and then across to north side.<br>
==F: All right.  Okay, okay.<br>
==G: Anyway, the {fp|uh} ... After leaving the abandoned monastery you're heading south west for just a half finger, and then you start curving ... slowly ... to the right, clockwise so you're probably avoiding something, and then you go due north, right up the west side of the alpine garden.  So that's how you get from the abandoned monastery to the alpine garden.  Then we're ...<br>
==F: So I'm curving around the alpine garden?<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And when you get to the northwest corner of the alpine garden, you make a ... a {ph|ssssudden=sudden} change from northerly to easterly.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: That's at a right angle turn to the right.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you get near the ... easterly part of alpine garden on the north border ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And you suddenly make a left-hand turn and veer {fp|uh} fairly sharply.  Go due north then to avoid the {fp|uh} youth hostel and to pass on the west side of the youth hostel as you go from south to north.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then when you get to the northwest corner of the youth hostel, you make another fairly sharp right turn, and are then heading east across the northerly border of the youth hostel.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: When you get to the northeast corner of the youth hostel, you make an {fp|uh} a fairly abrupt course alteration, and then head south east.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you'll be passing about eight finger-widths.  And you'll be just missing the previous track, when you went up past the {ab|abandon} ... excuse me ... abandoned monastery by about one finger-width.<br>
==F: So, d'you ... Am I going right for a telephone box?<br>
==G: Yeah.  You, you ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You're heading for the {le|t} of {ci|telephone} and you're ... then you're going to go ...<br>
==F: All right.  There.<br>
==G: west to east across the bottom of the word {ci|telephone box}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then, when you get past the {le|x} you go due north, about two and a half finger-widths ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {gg|Ah} ... Do you have ...<br>
==F: So I should be just at the top of the telephone?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: But on the northeast corner of it, sort of.<br>
==F: yeah, yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have a thatched mud hut, south of east lake?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.  I have a level ... level crossing.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: So I guess that would be it.<br>
==G: Well, if you take the ... south east corner of east lake, about one and a half finger-widths south of it, just put a little hut.  That's the thatched mud hut.<br>
==F: Yeah, that's where the ... That's ... That's exactly where the {fp|uh} level crossing is.<br>
==G: {gg|Oh}, okay.  Where ... {ab|Th} {ab|Th} This is the east ... southeast corner of east lake.  Okay.  Anyway, so you then ... Leaving the northeast corner of the telephone box, you go {ip|bout=about} one and a half fingers north west, and start arcing to the north, {ip|til=until} you're going due north, right up, underneath the ... the word {ci|east lake}, you're heading towards the lake.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you're almost in the middle of it.<br>
==F: Yeah.  Right there.<br>
==G: And you're ... you're just avoiding this thatched mud hut ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: by making that little curve to the west, northwest and then north.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: When you get about a ... a half a finger's breadth from east lake, you turn left, proceed on until you're about a half ... one finger's breadth past the {fp|uh} corner there, on the {ab|l} south west corner and you put your {le|x}.<br>
==F: That's where ...<br>
==G: You're moving parallel to the east lake, you know, west northwest or ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: West northwest by {br|w est=west} at that point.  That's it.<br>
==F: That's it?<br>
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==F: Right at east lake, that's it?<br>
==G: {ab|Y} ... Well, one finger's breadth west ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: of that, southwest of the southwest corner.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==F: Okay, John.  Start.<br>
==G: Okay, Richard.  Okay.  The ... You have the start at the top of the page?<br>
==F: Yeah.  {ph|Biii} ... I've got a burnt forest there.<br>
==G: Yeah.  It's {ab|r} ... Okay, it's right next to the burnt forest, there.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Okay.  From your start you're going to go just ... curve right along that ... the edge of burnt forest there ... and then {ab|a} ...<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, {ab|th} the west edge?<br>
==G: Yes.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And at the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest} ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: you're going to make a little curve ...<br>
==F: Curve where?<br>
==G: Just a little curve inward, in towards the {le|u} a little bit ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then curve out again ... Make a ... Curve out again ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: Do you have a ravine?  Down there?<br>
==F: I've got a ravine.<br>
==G: Just west over there?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, {ab|southw} southeast, I have a ravine.<br>
==G: Just southeast, yeah.  Of the burnt forest?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to make a little curve out, so that you're back in line with the ... the start ... So you're going to {ab|g} ... like, curve in at the {le|b}. Just make a little curve in ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: then curve back out ... and then, at the bottom of the ravine, not the word {ci|ravine}, the ravine itself ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: you're going to head west.<br>
==F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?<br>
<a name="12">-2G: Right.<br>
-1F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?<br>
<b>-0G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...<br>
</b>+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: go west.<br>
==F: Okay.  I got it.<br>
==G: Okay?  And then ... You see the top of the ravine?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay? Don't go right up along the side, just curve up gradually, up around, and over the top of the {ph|vravine=ravine} ... and {ab|abo} ...<br>
==F: Okay.  Hang on a second here. Okay.  From the {ab|bur} ... From {ph|theee=the} the the {le|b} of the {ab|bur} or from the {le|u} of the {ci|burnt forest} I was supposed to curve?  And then from {ab|wh} there, where do I go?  From the {le|u} of {ci|burnt forest}?<br>
==G: Okay.  Just make a little curve ... eastward, and then back out, westward, {ab|abou} at the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest}.  Okay?  Just curve in a little bit ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: Then {ab|gradual} gradually come out.  And then stop ... when you're in line ... with the bottom of the ravine ... and ... {ab|tha} that point should also be in line with the north point of {ci|start}. So that point right there.<br>
==F: Should be in line with what?<br>
==G: In line with the start.<br>
==F: With the start?<br>
<a name="13">-2G: Yeah, with the start point.  You should be in line, like they should ... be in the same line, you know?<br>
-1F: I ... No, I don't have that.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: you should stop so that you're in {ab|l} ... directly underneath ... the {le|a} in {ci|start}.<br>
==F: {gg|Oh} okay.  So {ab|basic} ...<br>
<a name="14">-2G: Just ... In line with it.<br>
-1F: Okay.  So, from the ravine I'm going west ... until I'm on with start?<br>
<b>-0G: No, no, no.  From the burnt forest ...<br>
</b>+1F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
+2G: you make your little curve ...<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Then you go back out west ...<br>
==F: Okay.  How far do I {ab|cur} ... Like, how far do I make this curve?<br>
==G: Just curve in a little bit, just in towards the {le|b}.  That's it.<br>
==F: Just in towards the {le|b}.  So, curve ... to the right? Is that what you're saying?<br>
==G: You'll be curving ... Curve in towards ... like, the ravine in a way, you know what I mean?<br>
==F: Not really.<br>
==G: Okay, then.  This is ... Do you have anything next to the burnt forest there or anything?<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Below the burnt forest I have carpenter's cottage, and that is west of the ravine.<br>
==G: West?  Okay.<br>
==F: It's west of the ravine and it's south of burnt forest.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well just ... Go right around that then.  Go right around ...<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm just going around it.<br>
==G: {ab|Ye} ... Just ... Yeah.  {ab|Tha} that's why I have this space.  Go around it ...<br>

==F: Okay.  So go ... east towards the ravine then?<br>
<a name="15">-2G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...<br>
-1F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?<br>
<b>-0G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.<br>

+2G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of the ravine ...<br>
==F: Yeah?<br>
==G: just start ... curve upwards, up north ...<br>
==F: Curve north then?<br>
==G: Yeah.  That's how ... {ab|wha} what it was before ... Then when you get the top of the ravine, curve so that you're going east then again ... You've curved up and gone north.  Now you've curved and going east ...<br>
==F: Okay.  So let me get this thing straight here.  From the start I go {ph|ssssou} I go south how far?<br>
==G: South, so that you're in line with the word ... so that you're in line with the bottom of the ravine.  How about that?<br>
==F: Okay.  That's ...<br>
<a name="16">-2G: Can you do that? ...<br>
-1F: Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve over the top of this carpenter's ...<br>

</b>+1F: Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...<br>
+2G: Right.  Then go east ...<br>
==F: and then curve ... east, okay.<br>
==G: and then curve up north ...<br>
==F: North, okay.  Got it.<br>
==G: and then curve over top of the ravine ...<br>
==F: Okay.  Got it.<br>
==G: and come around ... Do you have a remote village above the ravine?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well then, just curve over the top of the ravine.  Do you have pine grove there?<br>
==F: Yes.  I have pine grove to the {ab|wes} ... east.<br>
==G: Okay.  As you come over the top of the ravine, curve down along the west side of the pine grove ...<br>
==F: Curve down along the west side of the pine grove?  Okay.<br>
==G: Yeah.  And then ... Do you have anything right below the pine grove or anything?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, southeast of it I have the avalanche.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well I don't have that, so what you're going to do is curve around to the east of that ...<br>
==F: The east of where?<br>
==G: Of your avalanche.  That ... {ab|s} ...<br>
==F: So, how far south do I go, once I hit the west side of pine grove?<br>
==G: You just go to the bottom of pine grove ...<br>
==F: To the bottom of pine grove.  Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  And then curve around it.  You'll have to curve around it, won't you?  {ab|Ma} ...<br>
==F: Curve around the bottom?  Of pine grove?<br>
==G: Okay.  You've come ... south, along ... down to the the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove}, okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay?  Now make a little curve ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: starting at the {le|p} in {ci|pine} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: to the end of {ci|grove}.  Just make a little curve all the way out ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you're making like a little half moon kind of ...<br>
==F: Yeah.  Got it.<br>
==G: And then make another one ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: {ph|Zz} ... {ip|Cause=Because} your ... This this ... half moon'll be pointing almost, like, southwest ... Right?<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now make another one so that you're going back out east.  Do you have a ... concealed hideout there?<br>
==F: Yes, I have a concealed hideout.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well then, just ... Go in line.  Go go right around the concealed hideout ...<br>
==F: Around where?<br>
==G: Circle right around the {ab|l} ... out the {ab|we} ... the east side, sorry, the east side of the concealed hideout ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, where should I be from this curve?<br>
==G: Just make a little curve.  I don't have anything unless you do. {ab|I} It's only you ...<br>
==F: I've got a avalanche above the {ab|h} ... concealed hideout.<br>
==G: To the ...<br>
==F: Do you want me to curve past ... like, around the the avalanche.  Is it nearer the edge?<br>
==G: Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's where you're supposed to tell me if you have something there.<br>
==F: Okay.  All right.  So then I curve ... Now I'm ... I'm on the {ab|ea} east side of the concealed hideout.<br>
==G: Yeah.  You should be on the east side.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You're curving right around it ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and then going straight along ... the bottom of the word {ci|{ph|concede} hideout} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then, do you have a boathouse there?<br>
==F: I have a boathouse to the {br|south east=southeast}.<br>
==G: Okay.  Don't worry about it then.  You see the the highest point in crane bay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Stop there ...<br>

==G: Okay, start heading ... east, for about ... the length of a pen.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and stop when you're at the length of the pen ...<br>
==F: So just before ... like, if you came straight up off of the {le|f} in {ci|farmyard}?<br>
==G: You head ... {le|F} in {ci|farmyard}?<br>
==F: Or ... Do you have that?  Or do you have ...<br>
==G: Yeah, the farmyard's down in the bottom right-hand corner of mine.<br>
==F: Yeah, but if you just came straight up from the {le|f}, is that as far over ...<br>
==G: That's ... Yeah, that's perfect!<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  Then head {ab|st} straight north ...<br>
==F: So I'm just going up the ... right-hand side of privately owned fields?<br>
==G: Privately owned fields.  And the granite quarry on top?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You got the granite quarry?  Okay, head straight up towards the granite quarry, go over the top of it, just missing it by about a quarter of an inch, all the way round.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Once you get to the left-hand side ... of ...<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: You're there?<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay, start bending down and go in between waterfall and train crossing.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And head right up the right {fp|uh} the left-hand side of waterfall directly north.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay?  Curve into the far right-hand edge of waterfall, where you see the mountain ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: just only about an inch and a half, then head directly north for about two inches.<br>
==F: Okay, where am I going in relationship to public footpath?<br>
==G: I don't have the public footpath.  So what I want you to do {ab|i} ...<br>
==F: Okay, do you have cornfields?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay, {ab|pub} ...<br>
==G: You're about two inches below cornfield, heading north.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Stop there.<br>
==F: Got it.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Got it?  Okay.  Now we curve on a forty-five degree angle, down towards fallen cairn.  You have that?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: So almost a straight line heading down towards fallen cairn ...<br>
==F: Okay, am I going under it?<br>
==G: Go underneath fallen cairn.  Make a wide loop ... and just leave about a quarter of an inch on either side ...<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: Okay, head back up north {ab|ea} {fg|er} northwest ... missing limestone cliffs.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: by about half an inch.  Get up to the lake until you're about a quarter of an inch away from the lake ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Follow the lake heading west ... to the finish point.  Which is about one inch from the bottom ...<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: southeast. of the ... There?<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: Okay, you want to read it back to me?<br>
==F: Okay from the {ab|s} ...<br>
==G: Okay Brian, you ready?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Let's make this a quick one.  Do we have {fp|uh} crest falls?  Down at the bottom of start point?<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have, just above that, off to the right, old temple?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  You go about two inches to the left, and there should be poison stream.<br>
==F: Don't have that.<br>
==G: Okay, put in {fp|uh} just an {le|x} there and a cross-bones or whatever, and it's just slightly below the level of the temple, the bottom of the temple?  {ip|Bout=About} two inches over.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and about another half inch over from that ... you'll have footbridge.  Same as we had on the last one?<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: Four poles and ...<br>
==F: Okay, that's only ... a half inch from the poison river?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay, I was over closer to the temple.  Okay, I'll put it over closer to the footbridge.<br>
==G: Okay, {ip|cause=because} ... So you have footbridge then, {fg|eh}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: So as we go around we got crest falls we make a big turn, footbridge, poison stream, old temple.  And we'll make a big round up.  You got abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Yeah, beside slate mountain.<br>
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, I haven't got slate mountain.  So where's slate mountain?  In conjunction with the truck?<br>
==F: Slate ... Slate mountain ... The abandoned truck is about half way up slate mountain ... and slate mountain {ph|iiis=is} between the old temple and abandoned truck, sort of in that centre portion, there.<br>
==G: In the centre portion?  So like on a forty-five degree angle across one another?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} ... No actually, like, {fp|um} ... {gg|hmm}. {ci|Slate mountain} the actual word ...<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: is in line with the top of the ... point on the old temple ...<br>
==G: Okay, good.  That gives me an idea where to go.  Slate mountain?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: indecipherableSpeech Okay.  You got abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, we go down to baboons ...<br>
==F: Don't have baboons.<br>
==G: Okay.  Right underneath abandoned truck, where the {le|a} is, go down two inches, over half an inch, and put a little mountain ... and baboons on it. Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah, got it.<br>
==G: Okay.  We'll be going around that.  Have you got white mountain?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Have you got pyramid?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, underneath the pyramid, have you got cobblestone street?<br>
==F: No, I have remote village.<br>
==G: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah okay, in between remote village and {fp|uh} the pyramid ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: cobblestone street.<br>
==F: Okay.  {ab|Wh} What ...<br>
==G: So put it ... just about in the centre.<br>
==F: In line with the {le|y} {ab|i} ...<br>
==G: In in line with the right {fp|uh} left-hand edge of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And the left-hand ... and right in line with the {le|r} in {ci|remote} ...<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: if they came right straight down.  Okay, you have remote village, then?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, we're laughing.  We're at the start point.<br>
==F: Start point.<br>
==G: Now you don't have anything in ... {fp|uh} below {fp|uh} footbridge? Starting from the start point?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} okay, there's a banana tree ... below footbridge ... to the left and ... about the same parallel as crest falls.<br>
==G: Okay, banana tree?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, I'll put a tree there. Okay.  Looks realistic now.  Okay, we start from there, we go ... heading south around the top of the falls and down ...<br>
==F: Okay, which side of the falls are we going down?  Left or right?<br>
==G: We're going the left-hand side.<br>
==F: Down the left, okay.<br>
==G: Okay, just slightly turn up, go straight across then, as you hit the bottom of the {le|c} ... in {ci|crest falls} ... just angling off ... and head directly west.  Go underneath ... the banana trees, I guess you said it was?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, once you're about {fp|uh} an inch or so past banana trees, make a big loop coming right back up to footbridge.  Connect right in to cross over the bridge.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Got it?<br>
==F: There.  Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now we're going to go in between footbridge and poison stream. So you come off the end of the footbridge, drop about an inch and a half down ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and then head directly ... east ... and start turning up just before you get to old temple.  About a quarter of an inch away from old temple ...<br>
==F: So I'm going to run up the left side of old temple?<br>
==G: Left side of old temple.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: {ab|s} ...<br>
==F: I'm at the top of the old temple.<br>
==G: Okay.  Keep on going up about another two inches ... and then start turning and make a roundabout over ... slate mountain, I guess it is you have yours?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Over the top of slate mountain ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Curve back down ... and go underneath ... the abandoned truck ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You go right to the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned truck}.<br>
==F: Right.  Just a second.<br>
==G: Then ...<br>
==F: Okay, I'm {fp|uh} ... After I come off of slate mountain I'm more or less a flat line underlining the abandoned truck?  To to the {le|a}?<br>
==G: Yeah, you make like a loop going over the top of the mountain ...<br>
==F: Yeah, done.<br>
==G: And ... straight line underneath truck ... abandoned truck ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And stop at the {le|a} ... and then just a little curve and go straight ... south ... for about two inches underneath baboons.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: You'll curve all the way up and around ... the hill where the baboons are on ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and head straight north on a slight angle towards white mountain. You'll be about a quarter of an inch away from white mountain, following up the side.<br>
==F: Up the left side?<br>
==G: Up the left side of the mountain.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now, let me know when you {ab|g} ...<br>
==F: All right, I'm at the top of the mountain.<br>
==G: You're at the top?  Okay, you must have something above white mountain?<br>
==F: Lemon grove.<br>
==G: Lemon grove?  Is that ... How {ab|f} ... How high from white mountain is it?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} about three fingers ...<br>
==G: Three {ab|fi} ...<br>
==F: and the left edge of it is directly in line with the highest point of white mountain and it runs about one inch to the right.<br>
==G: One inch to the right, towards cobblestone street?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Actually, it ... it's {fp|uh} in line with the word {ci|pyramid} ...<br>
==G: Okay ... Good.  You have to avoid that.  {ph|Bypy} ... Bypass that ... and go over ...<br>
==F: Which way?<br>
==G: over the top of it ...<br>
==F: So I'm going up the left side of it?<br>
==G: Yeah, up the left side of it ...<br>
==F: Okay, {ab|s} now, when I leave the top of white mountain at the point, am I going straight up?<br>
==G: Straight north. Straight north.<br>
==F: Straight north, okay, I'm at the top of lemon grove.<br>
==G: Now.  We'll just make sure where this lemon grove is.  We're almost finished here.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: The lemon grove ... is in line, sort of thing, with cobblestone and off to the left of {fp|uh} pyramid, right?<br>
==F: Correct.<br>
==G: Okay.  Once you get above your lemon grove ... hang a {ph|sssharp=sharp} right ... head towards the base of the pyramid about a quarter of an inch up from the base of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and then just follow the shape of the pyramid to the top and down the other side.  Going up the left-hand side ...<br>
==F: Got it.  Done.<br>
==G: down the right-hand side ...<br>
==F: Done!<br>
==G: turn around, go underneath pyramid ...<br>
==F: Underneath the word?<br>
==G: Underneath the word {ci|pyramid} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And go out about {fp|uh} an inch ... from the word ... from the {le|p} ... and start {ab|angli} ... Have you got {ph|cobblesko} cobblestone street there?<br>
==F: No, but I've sort of put it in.<br>
==G: Okay, you got to have ... You got to be over about a quarter of an inch past or an inch past the edge of the pyramid ... the left-hand edge.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And start making your way slightly on an angle down to remote village. You have that?<br>
==F: Okay, now am I going ...<br>
<a name="22">-2G: You're going south.<br>
-1F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled street, I'm going before it?<br>

</b>+1F: Okay.  All right, got you.<br>
+2G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?<br>
==F: All right, so I'm running down sort of the left side of cobbled street?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Angling {ab|i} in, okay, {fp|uh} ...<br>
==G: Just slightly ... You're about an inch ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: an inch and a half away from white mountain, the {ab|fa} ... the the right-hand edge.<br>
==F: Okay, I'm ...<br>
==G: When you get to the bottom ...<br>
==F: I'm in line with remote village now.<br>
==G: Okay, you just curve right underneath the {le|r} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Nice little curve, a quarter of an inch ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and head straight in to the {le|x} ... which is {fp|uh} half an inch past the {le|e} ... and finish.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You got that?  Okay, I'll just talk you through the whole thing again. Your start, we went down the right {ab|ha} or the left-hand side of crest falls, around the banana grove, across the footbridge, in between footbridge and poison stream, up the left-hand side of the temple, over the top of slate mountain, curve down ... underneath abandoned truck, curve down at south again, underneath {ab|ab} {fp|uh} baboon mountain or whatever they {ab|ar} ... whatever it is ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: up the other side north ... heading up towards white mountain, a quarter of an inch from white mountain right up to the top ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: then straight north ... and, I guess it's slate mountain you got there?<br>
==F: Lemon grove.<br>
==G: Lemon grove?  Over the top of the lemon grove, just about to the ... straight east to the pyramid, up the left-hand side of the pyramid, down the right-hand side, curved around ... underneath pyramid, then straight south, or almost straight south, under remote village, and then straight ... heading east to the finish line.<br>
==F: You got it.<br>
==G: Got it?  That's it!<br>
==G: Okay.  Your start point should {ph|beee=be} ... site of a forest fire?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, do you have a picnic site below it?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Do you have a ... an adventure playground ...<br>

==F: {ph|Aaa=A} banana tree which is below and slightly to the left.<br>
==G: Okay. {ab|D} Good.  {ip|Kay=Okay} so come ... {ab|d} okay {fp|er} footbridge. Do you got something to the right of the footbridge?<br>
==F: Old temple?<br>
==G: Okay.  Well, between the old temple and the bridge, about an inch away from the footbridge ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: there's a poisoned stream.<br>
==F: Okay, {ab|we} ...<br>
==G: Put about an inch line that diagonally going from {fp|er} ... north to east and {ab|a} west south, okay?<br>
==F: Northeast to west south.<br>
==G: So the right ... from the right to the left, on a diagonal.<br>
==F: Okay, {ab|f} about an inch long?<br>
==G: {fp|Er}, {ip|bout=about} half an inch.<br>
==F: Half an inch?  {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay?  {ab|Y} You got something above {ab|th} the ... that ... what I just told you, didn't you?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, slate mountain.<br>
==G: Okay. ... Okay, good.  So okay, here's where we're going to go.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You got an abandoned truck too, don't you?<br>
==F: Just to the {ab|r} left of slate mountain.<br>
==G: Okay.  Just to ... the left again ...<br>
==F: Of the abandoned truck?<br>
==G: Yeah.  To the left, and down about an inch and a half, there's a hill.  It's called the ... bamboons ...<br>
==F: {ph|Sss}.  It's ...<br>
==G: baboons.<br>
==F: directly off the left of the ... abandoned truck?<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, it's off to the left and down about an inch and a half.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, you've got white mountain?<br>
==F: {fp|Er} yes I do.<br>
==G: You got something above white mountain, right?<br>
==F: Lemon grove.<br>
==G: Okay, good.  Pyramid?<br>
==F: Yeah. To the right of the lemon {ab|gro} grove ...<br>
==G: Okay, under the pyramid you got cobbler's street?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, no I don't.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, right under ... the pyramid ... about, from the bottom of the pyramid I'd say an inch ...<br>
==F: So that in between the remote village and the pyramid?<br>
==G: Yeah exactly, right between there.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  That's all we need.  So you're going to start at the top of the falls ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Going to come down the left-hand side of the falls ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Across ... You got the ... What's there again?<br>
==F: I don't know, I have a banana tree.<br>
==G: What do you ... {fg|oh}, the lemon trees? Or the banana tree?<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: Go around the left side of the banana tree.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay.  Up the {ab|be} ... up the ... up towards the top of the banana tree.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, loop around ... above the banana tree.  Come {ab|ove} come over the footbridge.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay-Okay} stop when you get {ab|i} ... {ip|Kay=Okay} come down ... on the left side of the poisoned stream.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Go over to the old temple.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Go up and around {fp|erm} ... What have you got there?  The fort?<br>
==F: {fg|Er} {ph|fff}, slate mountain's the only ...<br>
==G: Slate mountain. Go up and around slate mountain ...<br>
==F: Okay, do I go ... Which side of the temple?<br>
==G: Go up the right side of slate mountain.<br>
==F: Right side of slate ... mountain.  Which side of the temple?<br>
==G: {fp|Er}, left side of the temple.<br>
==F: Left side of the temple, right side of slate mountain.<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, go over top.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Loop back down under the abandoned truck.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, {fp|er}, go straight under the abandoned truck.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: To the front of the truck.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, loop around where I told you that that hill there.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: So you go down the right-hand side of the hill.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Underneath, and then back up the left-hand side of the hill.<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: Okay, up to the left-hand edge of ... white mountain.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, you got something above white mountain, don't you?<br>
==F: Lemon grove.<br>
==G: Okay, go up and over the lemon grove ... and start looping back to your right, after you get over the lemon grove.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you're heading right towards the middle of the pyramid ... Right?<br>
==F: {fg|Er}, {gg|oh} you want ... okay.<br>
==G: At the bottom?  All right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, you go up and over ... Once you get to the pyramid go up and over the pyramid ... and around down the right-hand side of the pyramid.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, remember I told you the cobbled street?<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: Okay, I want you to go between the cobbled street and the pyramid ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Just to the edge of the pyramid, then come straight down to the remote village.  To the bottom of the remote village.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, then go straight right ... at to the finish line which is ... the ... other {ab|si} the ... just the right ... bottom right corner of remote village.<br>
==F: Right, done.<br>
==G: Done!  Good, let's get out of here.<br>
==G: Okay, your start point {ph|iiis=is} a burnt out forest, or just above a burnt out forest ...<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: Do you have anything around that area?<br>
==F: I have a carpenter's cottage below it.<br>
==G: Directly below it?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, you're going to curve in and go underneath the {fp|uh} ... the {fp|uh} ... cottage ... and in ... turn east towards the ravine ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and follow the left side of the ravine ... up north.  And do you have a remote village?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, along line with the {fp|uh} burnt out forest ... is a remote village, so you'll have to turn over the cliffs.  Or the ravine.<br>
==F: Can you speak louder, please.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Beside ...<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Beside the burnt forest is a remote village?<br>
==G: Okay, go south ... down towards the south end of the village ... then turn east towards the ravine ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  Head north ... Stop approximately ... one finger above the {fp|uh} top of the ravine ... and then turn east.<br>
==F: Okay, so I've gone around the carpenter's cottage, I've gone left side of the ravine, now I'm on top of the ravine ... Which way do I want to go by the remote village?<br>
==G: {ab|Y} You want to head below the remote village, so you're just heading east, right now.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, do you have a pine grove?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, head towards pine grove ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: curve down along the left side of pine grove ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have anything in that area, below it?<br>
==F: Avalanche and concealed hideout.<br>
==G: Okay, I haven't got an avalanche.  So I assume the avalanche is below ... the {fp|uh} pine grove, like directly below?<br>
==F: Well, {br|i it's=it's} below and a little bit to the right.<br>
==G: Okay.  You'll have to go around ... the {fp|uh} the ...<br>
==F: Avalanche?<br>
==G: the avalanche.<br>
==F: Go around it?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: On the east side of it?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then a down ... curve slightly in ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: towards {fp|uh} the west and then go ... and then take a sharp turn around ... the {fp|uh} ... cancelled hideout.<br>
==F: Concealed hideout?<br>
==G: The concealed hideout, correction.<br>
==F: Do you want me to go ... over top?<br>
==G: Go around on the east side, over top, around the east side.<br>
==F: Over top of the concealed hideout ... Okay, and then what do I do?<br>
==G: Okay, {ph|yon} ... you're {ph|be_uh_low=below} concealed hideout?<br>
==F: I should be below it?<br>
==G: Yeah.  You're underneath it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have a boathouse?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh} which boathouse?  How many ... Is it right beside {fp|uh} concealed hideout?<br>
==F: No.  It's on crane bay.<br>
<a name="28">-2G: Okay, approximately two fingers from concealed hideout is a boathouse, directly to the west of it.<br>
-1F: So it's not on {ab|le} the water?<br>
<b>-0G: No it isn't.<br>
</b>+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: Okay, you'll go out two fingers, stop, and then head south, towards, like, a bite mark in crane bay ...<br>
==F: A bite mark in crane bay.<br>
==G: It just sort of curves in, the shore line.<br>
==F: Okay.  So I've {ph|gooone} ... I've come underneath concealed hideout?<br>
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==F: And then how far west do I want to go?<br>
==G: {ab|Ho} ... You want to go two fingers from the {fp|uh} west side of concealed mountain ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: You want to go two fingers out.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then start ... And then go straight down and follow the shore along {ip|til=until} you reach the {fp|uh} furthest point out ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then stop.  Do you have a coconut palm?<br>
==F: {ph|Nnnno=No}. I have ...<br>
==G: A pebbled shore?<br>
==F: Pebbled shore.<br>
==G: Okay, just above {fp|uh} pebbled shore, is a coconut palm on my map.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You'll follow the shore down ...<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==G: and then you'll turn west ... just over pebbled {ab|f} {fp|uh} pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then you'll head {fp|uh} southwest ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: Do you have anything in the lower region?  Other than a flagship?<br>
==F: I see flagship and washed stones.<br>
==G: Okay, I assume you're going to be going around washed stones on the west side ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Your finish point will be in front of the flagship ... approximately one finger off the shore.<br>
==F: In front, one finger, okay.  So I am just ... west of flagship?<br>
==G: Yes, you're just west it ... west of flagship.<br>
==F: <br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Right on!<br>
==G: Okay, Terry!  {ph|Hmhuhhm}.  You've got the camera shop?<br>

==G: Yeah. Okay.  You got the alpine garden?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, right underneath the van, two inches ... there's a house called the youth centre.  I don't think you've got it.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, do you want to put that in?<br>
==F: Good.<br>
==G: {fg|Er}, I think that's all you'll need.  You've got the telephone box, right?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  {ph|A-a-a-and=And} you got ... east lake, too, don't you?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>

==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Come down the left-hand side.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {fg|Er} Loop underneath the truck.<br>
==F: All right.<br>

==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, then you're going to go ... right, okay, straight across the page ... {ip|til=until} you're underneath the spot ... underneath the {ab|l} right-hand corner of the missionary, and then you're going to go straight up to the missionary.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} I've got a flight museum in between there.<br>
==G: Yeah, that's okay.  So<br>
==F: So come up the right side of the flight museum?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Go ... Yeah.  Go straight ... If you go over to the ... where it says {fp|er} {ci|missionary} the {le|y} and go straight up ... towards the {le|y}, you'll be okay.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  Okay, go ... loop around the ... thing, the missionary.<br>
==F: Top of the missionary?<br>
==G: Yeah, go over the top come back down to the {le|a} on the other side.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
<a name="29">-2G: Okay, then you're going to ... {ab|l} make a small loop ... up, around left-hand side of the alpine gardens.  Stop at the top of alpine gardens.<br>
-1F: Dead centre top?<br>
<b>-0G: No.<br>
</b>+1F: Okay. ... Top left side?<br>
+2G: Top left.  Then go straight across the top to the top right-hand side.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>

==F: Okay, right side of the ... youth<br>
==G: {ab|Y} You're going to go up the left side of the youth centre.<br>
==F: Go up the left side of the youth centre.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay, go around the youth centre and stop at the top right-hand corner.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, you're going to go straight from there down to the telephone box.<br>
==F: Which is a diagonal, correct?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} which {ab|w}<br>
==G: Go underneath the {ab|diag} underneath the box ... to the {le|x} in {ci|box}, and then you're going to go up straight line up {ph|toooo=to} the top of the telephone box<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and then you're going to make a ... {fg|ah} ... you're going to go from there up to ... see {fp|er} east lake?  Okay, come across the top of the telephone booth, to the other side of the telephone box.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you're going to ... See the east lake?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go straight up towards the letter {le|e} but stop at the shoreline.<br>
==F: {fg|Er}, on {ci|lake}, correct?<br>
==G: {ab|Ye} {fg|er} yeah, the {le|e} of {ci|lake}.<br>
==F: Okay, {ip|cause=because} I have a level crossing in the way.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay?<br>
==F: Okay, I'm at the shoreline.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go follow the shoreline {fp|er} left.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay, {ip|til=until} you come to the point there, at the {ab|s} ... at the {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, {ab|th} go approximately half an inch ... straight across the page ... and put an {le|x}, and that's your ... finish button.<br>
==F: Okay.  Done!<br>
==G: Okay, Brian.  Have you got {fp|uh} burnt forest up in the left-hand corner of your map?<br>
==F: Start's marked, yeah.<br>
==G: {gg|Ah} you got the start point.  Have you got a finish point marked?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Do you have the flagship at the bottom of {ph|thuu=the} map?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  Just go inside, inland, about half an inch and ... directly in line with the flagship is an {le|x}.<br>
==F: The ship or the word {ci|flagship}?<br>
==G: The word {ci|flagship}, just go in an inch ...<br>
==F: {ab|Ok} ...<br>
==G: then write {ci|finish} and put an {le|x} above it.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Okay, let's see if we got everything.  Got burnt forest?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You got ravine?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now, do you have anything off to the left of ravine?<br>
==F: Carpenter's cottage.<br>
==G: Okay, I'll just build that in there.<br>
==F: It's {fp|uh} directly below burnt forest and it's on the same level as {ab|ra} ... as ravine.<br>
==G: Okay. Okay, do you have remote village above the ravine?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Okay.  Just go about {fp|uh} an inch and a half above the ravine there, the grassy area, and just mark in remote village because you'll have to go under that.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have pine grove off to the right?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay, where you do a little {ph|swiggle} all the way down.  Do you have {fp|uh} concealed hideout?<br>
==F: Yes, and between pine grove and concealed {ab|hi} hideout, I have avalanche.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, is that on the right or on the left of pine grove?<br>
==F: It's on the ... right of pine grove, and ... it runs from about the middle of concealed hideout ... off to the ... right and it {ab|s} ... it starts ... {ci|avalanche} the word starts about an inch above concealed {ph|highdrought=hideout} and runs up ... to about an inch below pine grove.  But over to the right side of the page.<br>
==G: Over to the right side?  So it's not directly in line with pine grove and ...?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have anything else there?  {ip|Cause=Because} I got {ph|ziss=this} wild loop here.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  Concealed hideout then boathouse, do you have that?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, then we go down to crane bay, do you have that?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, then you got a loop in crane bay, the first one.  You have a coconut {ph|pon} {ph|pawn} palm?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Uh} flagship, you got?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Pebble stone?<br>
==F: Washed stones and ... and pebbled shore.<br>
==G: Pebbled shore?  I don't have washed stones but I got pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You go up above that about {fp|uh} two fingers ... and over ... so that the first ... the trunk of the tree is in line with the {le|e}, two fingers up, and that'll be coconut palm.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Cause=Because} you got to go in between that and pebbled shore. Where's this other one you were talking about?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, washed stones ... the word {ci|stone} is in line with the {le|x} for the finish point ...<br>
==G: It's in line ...<br>
==F: and it goes to the left ... and it's about halfway in between ... the ... point by the flagship ...<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: and pebbled shore ... and it is about two fingers ... if you laid ... You see the straight edge of the shoreline there above the flagship?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: If you laid two fingers in there that's about your spacing to get washed stones.<br>
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, we have to go around that ... to get to the {fp|uh} finish point.  Okay, let's start!<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Burnt forest!<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You curve down to your right, slightly, then swing back ... {fp|uh} swing back {fp|uh} west and go around carpenter's cottage ... across the bottom of carpenter's cottage ... slowly swing up and go in between ravine and remote village.  But heading straight ...<br>
==F: Okay, am I going between carpenter's cottage and ravine?<br>
==G: And ravine.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you're on the {fp|uh} left-hand side of carpenter's cottage, or right-hand side of carpenter's cottage, going up.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: I'm with you.  I'm right at the top of the ravine right now.<br>
==G: Right across ... Yeah ... Right across to the two little birds there ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: about an eighth of an inch above them and straight ... heading east ... {ip|til=until} you get to the end of the {le|e} in {ci|village}, then angle yourself down to pine grove, so that your line comes right below the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ... then you do two little loops ... one going east ... that's about an inch long, and then you cut back very sharp ... going west, and then cut back very sharp east again to go around concealed hideout.  That's why I asked you if there was something there.<br>
==F: Okay, so I'm going ... east over towards avalanche ...<br>
==G: Yeah, don't get ... Don't touch avalanche and then bend back in going west ... just for a split second then turn back again ... going east and go all the way around concealed hideout.<br>
==F: Okay, am I going under concealed {ph|heimit=hideout} ...<br>
==G: Yeah, over the top ...<br>
==F: Or over the top of it?<br>
==G: on the right-hand side, coming around ... and straight underneath the words {ci|concealed hideout}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You got boathouse?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, go straight in line with the {le|e} in {ci|boathouse} and then straight ... south and follow that bend in the ... in the crane bay ... You see the ... where the shoreline goes?<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: The loop?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, just follow the loop around, until you get to the {ab|ne} next little tip there ... and then head straight ... {fp|uh} How you go there? ... southwest staying about {fp|uh} a quarter of an inch to half an inch off the shoreline ... for about three inches.  Now you got coconut palm marked in there now?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You go underneath the word {ci|coconut palm} ... and that's in between pebble stone and coconut palm then ...<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, then you swing way out and ... You got silver creek, there?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Or what was the name of that other place?<br>
==F: Washed stones?<br>
==G: Washed stones?<br>
==F: That's down below pebbled shore ...<br>
==G: You {ab|ke} ... You keep ... You ... Yeah.  You keep on going.  You bypass that on the left-hand side ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and keep on angling yourself towards the ... edge of the {ab|pap} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: But leaving about an inch and a half ... down near washstone ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then cut right back in to the finish line which should be directly in line with the flagship.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Got it?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: That's her.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Darcy, can you hear me?<br>
==F: Yes I can!<br>
==G: Do you have a start point?<br>
==F: {fg|Er}, {ph|nooooooo=no}.<br>
==G: You don't have a {ab|s} ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, yes I do!  Yes I do!  Yes I do!<br>
==G: Okay.  Is it above a camp?<br>
==F: Missionary camp.  Yeah.<br>
==G: Missionary camp.  Good.  And what I want you to do is, you see the left tent on the missionary {ab|te} {fp|er} ... missionary camp?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: See {ph|theee=the} the left point of it?  Like the {ph|lowep=lower} ... lower point of {ph|thee=the} tent?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: The furthest-to-the-left part of the tent.  What I want you to is ... do is put a dot, one inch above the lowest part and the furthest part to the left ... of that tent.  Understand?<br>
==F: Lowest part of the tent?  Okay.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Put ... An inch above that ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: put a dot.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now connect it from start to the dot. Got it?<br>
==F: Sure.<br>
==G: Do you have gorillas?<br>
==F: Gorillas? No.  Wish I did!  No I don't.<br>
==G: Do you have banana tree?<br>
==F: Banana tree?  Yeah!<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to {ab|d} ... You have the word {ci|missionary camp} then, right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Put {ph|aaaa=a} dot, about ... an inch and a half away from the word {ci|missionary camp} to the left of it ...<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: on that same level.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now connect it ... {ph|nn} the two dots that you have now.  Got it?<br>
==F: An inch and a half, right?<br>
==G: {ph|Iyyyeah=Yeah}.<br>
==F: Okay.  {fp|Er} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, now what I want you to do ... is go to the left tree ...<br>
==F: Left of the tree?<br>
==G: of your ... Left of the tree, one quarter of an inch, and go down ... to where it says {ci|banana tree} or whatever, right?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ph|Aaand=And} go down about a quarter of an inch, past the word {ci|banana tree} ... or one fifth of an inch past the word {ci|banana tree}.  Got it?<br>
==F: One fifth?  Okay.  Let me get my ruler out. There.  Got it!<br>
==G: Put a point.  Connect the two points.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to ... Do you have a rope bridge?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now is it above ... the trees?<br>
==F: Yes it is.<br>
==G: {ph|Aand=and} a bit to the right, right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, what I want you to do is go north ... due north, until you get between the word {ci|rope} and the word {ci|bridge} ... and stop and put a point.  So you're going due north.<br>
==F: Say, where am I right now?  I'm right under {ph|baana=banana} banana tree, right?<br>
==G: {fg|Er}, yeah.  {ab|Bu} ... You should be a little to the left of banana tree.<br>
==F: That's right.<br>
==G: Right.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: One quarter of an inch.<br>
==F: If I due ... If I go due north, I'll hit right the river.<br>
==G: River?<br>
==F: I'll hit right in the river, yeah.<br>
==G: {fp|Er}, river. River? Okay.  Okay.  All right.<br>
==F: So {fp|er} ... I go due north and I then I go {fp|er} north {fp|er} northeast or something like that?<br>
==G: What I want you to do is ... See ... Shit!<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I have gorillas.  Now what I want you to do ... You've got banana trees, right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And that's due west of the {ab|s} missionary camp?<br>
==F: {ph|Bllbbll}.  Exactly.<br>
==G: All right. And you went one quarter an inch to the left of that banana tree?<br>
==F: Yes I did.<br>
==G: The furthest-to-the-left banana tree?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And then you went down ... about a quarter of an inch ... and you put a point?<br>
==F: True.<br>
==G: And then you connected to the two last points, and now I'm telling you to go due north, and you're going to go right through a river?<br>
==F: Yeah.  {ip|Cause=Because} the rope bridge is ... {fp|er} above and to the right of the banana tree.<br>
==G: Yeah?  So the river should {ph|beee=be} to the right of the banana trees.<br>
==F: Yeah.  But you told me to go to the left of banana tree.<br>
==G: Yeah.  The left of the banana trees.<br>
==F: Okay.  I get you.  Okay.<br>
==G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go to the right side of the rope bridge, or you can draw a line right through the rope bridge if you want.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: To the right of it, and up?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: What I want you to do is, go to the middle of the steam, to the left of it about an inch.  Got me?<br>
==F: Sir!<br>
==G: Put a point, and connect the two last points that I gave you ...<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now ... {fp|er} ... Shit!  Now, you see where the cliff is, on the ... waterfall?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You see where it ends?  Go over, like, just a little smidge ...<br>
==F: To the right?<br>

==F: Got you.<br>
==G: Not the middle of the word.  The middle of pillars.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Put a point ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: and go up about a quarter of an inch ... but don't make a point ... and go left about a half an inch, and make a point. Got me?<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: So {ab|n} ... And then curve that line from the two points you've got.<br>
==F: Up or down curve?<br>
==G: Up curve. {ab|S} ... Up and to the left curve, right?<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do ... is {fp|er} ... Do you see the word {ci|pillars}?<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and {ph|cuuuuuuurve=curve} downwards, towards that ... point I just gave you.<br>

==F: Yeah<br>
==G: Go down an inch and a half from there ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: put a point ...<br>

==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Right?<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: To save time and ... go north northeast of there.  {fp|Er}, do you have ancient ruins?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Ruined city.  Same thing.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is curve up.  You'll see three birds. What I want you to is curve up as if you were going towards that top bird ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: But you're still staying about a quarter of an inch, almost a half an inch away from that bird.<br>
==F: Sure.<br>
==G: So you're pointing ... So you're going up sort of almost like a triangle, kind of ... pointing inwards ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: to the middle of the page.  Now ... Put a point.  Now, what I want you to do is ... Do you have stones?<br>
==F: {fp|Er} ... No.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to {ph|ss} ... the stones I have are {ab|dir} due north of me ... but what I ...<br>
==F: Okay.  Yeah, rock fall.  Same thing.<br>
==G: {ab|R} ... Okay, yeah. What I want you to do is go ... make a point {ab|r} about a half an inch to the right of the {ab|w} second {le|s} in the word {ci|stones}.<br>
==F: I haven't got the word {ci|stones}.<br>
==G: Or {ci|falls}, or whatever.<br>

==G: {fp|Er}, {ab|ab} actually about ... a fifth of an inch, we'll say.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Actually, what's the word you have?<br>
==F: {ci|Rock fall}.<br>
==G: Rock {ab|fa}?  Okay, {ab|g} ... just go {ab|st} ... right to the {le|l} ...<br>

==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, you see the word {ci|white mountain}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to draw a line going towards that word, just a bit above that word ... but I want you to stop ... about half an inch southwest of the {fp|erm} ... the bottom part ... the left bottom part of the mountain.<br>
==F: Southwest, okay.  So I'm going up around the ruined city, make a point at that rock fall ...<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go to the rock fall, just a minute.  I'm at the rock fall.  And at the southwest tip ... of white mountain.<br>
==G: Southwest tip of {fp|er} {ab|th} white mountain, you should be a half an inch ... southwest of there.<br>
==F: Okay.  Just a minute now ... {ph|Tssssssccchh}.  Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is {br|go o=go} go {fp|er} ... You're going to stay a quarter of an inch away from the mountain at all times ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah?<br>
==G: as you're going straight up to the peak ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Go right up to the peak ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ab|S} ... Continue staying at about a quarter of an inch or almost a half an inch away ... from the mountain as you're going down the other side of that mountain ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you {ph|ter=to} ... {fp|erm} ... curve ... {ph|dooooown=down} ... {gg|Oh}, this is hard to say. Do you have a {ab|b} a big furniture store or something?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  You have gazelles, though, right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do ... is come down from the {ph|woooooord=word} ... or from the letter {le|w}.  See the {ab|wo} letter {le|w}?<br>
==F: {ab|Ye} ...<br>
==G: In {ci|white mountain}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to ... Make a point there ... and I want you to curve from where you stopped writing last ... downwards, about an inch from the {le|w}.  Got me?<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: It's kind of {fp|er} confusing.  Now what I want you to do is come out ... an inch to the left of there, like, due west of there ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: put a point, join the two ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now I want you to go due south ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: curve around the gazelles ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You're staying about a half an inch away from the gazelles ...<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: {ph|aaaand=and} you're going about ... two inches to the right ... of the gazelles ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Stop.  Finish.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Kim, you ready there?<br>
==F: Sure am.<br>
==G: You got a diamond mine?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have the start position?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: What I want you to do is I want you to loop down on the left-hand side of the diamond mine {ip|til=until} you're underneath it.<br>
==F: {ip|Til=Until} {ab|r} ... I'm under the word {ci|diamond {ph|mind=mine}}?<br>
==G: Correct.<br>
==F: Under the {le|d}?<br>
==G: Under {ph|thuuh=the} second {le|d} in {ci|diamond {ph|mind=mine}}.<br>
==F: Excellent!  I'm there!<br>
==G: Do you have a wagon wheel? To the right of your diamond mine?<br>
==F: No.  I have a cactus ... to ...<br>
==G: Where's that?<br>
==F: It is in the upper ... right-hand corner of my map ...<br>
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==F: below rift valley.<br>
==G: Okay, I do not have that.  Is it directly below rift valley?<br>
==F: Yes!<br>
==G: Is it to the left or to the right of ... the word {ci|rift valley}.<br>
==F: To the left.<br>
==G: To the left?  {ab|H} like an inch over roughly?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, this is what {ph|hmph} we have to do.  It's about three inches ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: from your diamond mine to its right is the wagon wheel?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.  So I have to avoid it?<br>
==G: Right.  Now {br|y you=you} have to proceed on a northeast east direction?<br>
==F: Okay, definitely.<br>
==G: For about three inches.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Got that?<br>
==F: Okay, but {ab|av} ...<br>
==G: Maybe three and a half.<br>
==F: But avoid this wagon wheel.<br>
==G: Pointed ... You should be going almost toward rift valley.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: So go now?<br>
==G: Yes.  So go for three inches, and then stop.<br>
==F: I'm stopped.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now I want you to do a little ... jaunt up ... north ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and a little bit of a curve in towards the west.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, into the west.<br>
==G: Do you understand what I'm saying?  So ...<br>
==F: Into the west?<br>
==G: Yeah.  So just like a curve around where the wagon wheel would be. Just a little bit.  Not ... Like, just {ip|til=until} you'd be at the top of it.  Do not go completely around.  Do you understand?<br>
==F: Yes, I do.<br>
==G: Just go {ip|til=until} you're at the side of it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now I want you to {br|pro ceed=proceed} north for about an inch.  You should almost be level with your start position.  On the ... horizontally.<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay?  Understand?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now!  We're going to go right.  Right into the middle of rift valley. See that ... how there's trees or cactuses on each side of it?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: See in the middle where there's that gravel?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Do I come ...<br>
==G: That path?<br>
==F: over the trees into the gravel?<br>
==G: Yes.  You go over and then through right in the middle of the gravel.<br>
==F: Okay and ...<br>
==G: And ...<br>
==F: And stop at the word {ci|rift}?  Like just to ...<br>
==G: Yeah, right by where the {le|r} is.<br>
==F: Over to the left of it?  Okay, I'm stopped there.<br>
==G: Okay.  It should be about the same size as a pop can, that ...<br>
==F: Yeah!<br>
==G: Okay.  Now what I want you to do ...<br>
==F: That's neat!<br>
==G: is go south for about two inches.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have rocks?<br>
==F: Yeah!<br>
==G: About an inch over the rocks, stop.  Over the big rock middle of it.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a stone creek?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Do you have white water?<br>
==F: I have rapids?<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Your white water is your rapids.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... See where the end of your {ci|rapids} is written?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, I have a swamp.  I ... I should tell you.<br>
==G: Okay, where is that located?<br>
==F: It is northwest of my rapids.<br>
==G: Northwest?  Yes, I see that.<br>
==F: Okay.  {ph|S} that's ...<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is I want you to go down on a southwest direction ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: for about {ab|th} three inches.  You should be ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh} ... Where will I end up?<br>
==G: About ... an inch and a half over from your white water ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  And ...<br>
==F: And that's where I'll be?<br>
==G: And you'll be down just sightly into the picture of the white water, roughly.  There's a stone creek right there that you're trying to avoid.  So you ... The stone creek protrudes a little bit down south of the white water.  Do you understand?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah.<br>
==G: Like of the rapids? {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Are you down at the bottom point now? ...<br>
==F: No, no, I ... I'm not there yet {ip|cause=because} I want to know, do I loop around the rocks?<br>
==G: Okay ...<br>
==F: Like, or do I {ph|cu} hug the side of the rocks?<br>
==G: All I do ... Just go straight from the {ab|poi} ... last point I gave you ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: to the point almost equal with your rapids.  On a southwest heading.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you should be about an inch and a half away from the white {ab|wa} ... like, the rapids at this point.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what I want you to do is I want you to do a {ab|bi} ... Do you have an outlaws' {br|ha ideout=hideout}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything underneath the white water?<br>
==F: Yeah, a manned fort.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  How far is that underneath the white water?  Roughly?<br>
==F: Three inches?<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do now, is I want you to make a big {le|c}.<br>
==F: {br|O okay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Now with that {le|c} I want you to go all the way round the white water on to its west hand side.  I want you to keep on the west and then the {br|s outh=south} edge of your {fp|uh} thing that you gave me but three inches below the white water.  Do you understand?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah okay, so ...<br>
==G: A big {le|c}, just a big {le|c} ...<br>
==F: Am I going around my rapids and around my manned fort?<br>
==G: Yes.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.<br>
==G: And you're staying on the left of both of them.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you'll end up at the {br|b bottom=bottom} of your {fp|uh} ...<br>
==F: Manned fort.<br>
==G: Your manned fort.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, see your outlaws' hideout?<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}!<br>
==G: I want you to aim straight for the {le|o}.  Draw a straight line ... between there and the {le|o}.<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: You should be pretty close.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, do you have a noose down on the right ... hand ... corner bottom edge?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {ab|s} a pond?  Or something resembling a pond in the ... bottom right-hand area?<br>
==F: No. ... I have ... under my outlaws' hideout I have a gold mine ...<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: and under that I have a noose.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything to the west of that?  Of the noose?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Stone slabs.<br>
==G: Okay, that's up high ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have a stone creek?<br>
==F: I ... yes I do!<br>
==G: Do you have a saloon bar?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  For now what I ...<br>
==F: And that's all I've got.<br>
==G: Okay, for now what I want you to do is measure off about an inch and a half ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: west of your noose, and an inch and a half down from your noose.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...<br>
==G: Just put a {br|l ittle=little} dot there, okay?<br>
==F: Let me think.  {br|I inch=Inch} and a half over and inch and a half down, okay.  There's a little dot there.<br>
==G: It should be ... right underneath your stone slabs but down about three inches from that.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  What I want you to do now is I want you to {fp|er} a ... big reverse {le|c} from your outlaws' hideout to that point I just gave you.<br>
==F: Okay.  I got it.  Am I going around my gold mine and around my noose?<br>
==G: Yes.<br>
==F: And I'm ...<br>
==G: Towards the east side of it.<br>

==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, what we have to do now is we have to go {br|o over=over} top of what's called swan pond.  It's about the same as that pop can up at the top.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: What I want you to do now is measure off about ... two and a half inches to the immediate west of that.<br>

==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: So, {br|u underneath=underneath} the banana tree?<br>
==G: Right.  Just stop when you're underneath it.<br>
==F: Okay. ... I'm underneath it.<br>
==G: Now we're going to do a big {le|c} up, right onto the footbridge.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.  Too easy.<br>
==G: Now do you have a poisoned stream on the other side of your footbridge?<br>
==F: No!<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}!<br>
==F: I have an old temple ... above crest falls and {ab|ju} ...<br>
==G: Okay.  But the ... {br|foot bridge=footbridge} with the poisoned stream is right ... beside the footbridge.<br>
==F: Okay.  I don't have it.<br>
==G: What you have {br|t o=to} do ... You're up to the footbridge now?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: On the east hand side of the footbridge ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: go south ... one inch.<br>
==F: So go over the footbridge and then south one inch?<br>
==G: Directly south one inch.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... two inches ... east.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have something directly above that point?  Level with your abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Slate mountain.<br>
==G: Right. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what I want you to do ... is we're going to do a reverse {le|c} this time, and you're going to end up right at the point of that slave mountain or whatever.<br>
==F: Right at the tip?<br>
==G: Right at the tip of it ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}.<br>
==G: underneath that remote {ph|villach=village}, by about an inch and a half.<br>
==F: All right!<br>
==G: Do you understand?<br>
==F: I'm ... heading there now.<br>
==G: Now ... You will ... You are staying on the west hand side of the old temple ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh} yeah!  That's right.<br>
==G: So don't ... So don't go over {ph|tho=to} the old temple ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Just go up to it, and do a reverse {le|c} around to it ... and stop when you're there.<br>
==F: {ph|Aaand=And} I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay.  You have the abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Head southwest until you ... almost meet the {le|k} in the {ci|truck}. Do you understand?<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Bout=About} two and a half inches.  Now, go two inches west ... You should be at the other end of it, almost where the {le|a} is ...<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have baboons or anything like that ... {br|imme diately=immediately} to your southwest?<br>
==F: I have nothing immediately to my south west.<br>
==G: Okay, what I want you to do now, is go down, an inch and a half ... south ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: from that point.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Just put a dot there.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And from there, an inch and a half ... west.  Put another dot there.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: An inch and a half up, and put another dot there.  You should have almost like {ph|aaa=a} square box there.<br>
==F: Yeah!<br>
==G: Now what I want you to do is do a loose, flowing {le|u} through that. Do you understand?<br>
==F: {ph|Yeeees=Yes}!<br>
==G: And ... it'll look like a {le|u}.<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, it's done.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, you have white mountain on your map?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: See the {ab|summi} ...<br>
==F: Directly {fp|er} north of this abandoned truck.<br>
==G: Right.  {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do is just mark a dot ... about ... half an inch off the top of white mountain's summit ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: a little bit towards the northwest.<br>
==F: Okay.  Done.<br>
==G: Now.  Connect those two points, where you start with that {le|u} ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: and there ... and go ... along ... the side of the mountain when you get close to it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  You there?<br>
==F: Done.  Done, yeah.<br>
==G: Now I want you to go two inches ... north ... and you should be ... level with the pyramid ... sand.  You have a pyramid on your map at the top?<br>
==F: Yeah.  I have a lemon grove in my way though.<br>
==G: {ab|T} ...<br>
==F: Do you want me to go to the left of it?<br>
==G: {fg|Erm} ...<br>
==F: Or to the right of it?<br>
==G: you should be able to just avoid it.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ab|I} ...<br>
==F: {ab|I} ...<br>
==G: And that would probably be to {ph|thee=the} left ... Like it's right above white mountain, I presume, correct?<br>
==F: It is.<br>
==G: Okay, go up to the top left-hand corner of there.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Now ... See how the pyramid is shaped?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: I want you to draw a line until you're about half an inch nearer the pyramid.  Like {ph|aaa=a} east line until you're half an inch away from the pyramid. {br|A at=At} that point you will stay around ... half an inch around the entire pyramid ... and then go underneath the words, like you'll have to give it a bit more room for around the words. Do you understand?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: So make a big pyramid around it.  And stop when you're right underneath {ph|thee=the} word {ci|pyramid}.<br>
==F: {ab|Oka} ...<br>
==G: Are you there?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do you have a cobbled street?<br>
==F: Wait!  Did I go over the {ab|m} ... over the pyramid to do this?<br>
==G: Yes you did.<br>
==F: {gg|Ah}!<br>
==G: Over.<br>
==F: Okay, I'm not there yet.<br>
==G: Okay.  So you went in {ph|aaa=a} ... northeast direction? ... And then you went in {ph|aaa=a} ...<br>
==F: There.  I'm ... I'm there now.<br>
==G: southeast direction?  And then in ... almost like a west direction?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Should be a loop around. ... Now, do you have a cobbled street below this?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Do you have a remote village?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...<br>
==F: I have ...<br>
==G: Yes?<br>
==F: a poisoned stream.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, that's not ...<br>
==F: {br|I ignore=Ignore} it?<br>
==G: anything to do with our map.<br>
==F: {br|O okay=Okay}.  I have this remote village.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Right above the remote village is a cobbled street.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So what we're going to have to do here is another one of those fancy {le|c}'s.  But this one is ... sharp at the top.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So go an inch ... west, and stop ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and now do a curved {le|c} ... just a slight curve, not {ph|aaa=a}<br>
==F: Am I doing a ...<br>
==G: winding curve ... and underneath ...<br>
==F: a frontwards {le|c} or a backward {le|c}?<br>
==G: A normal {le|c} that you'll end up underneath the remote village.<br>
==F: A normal {le|c}.  Okay. Done.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Are you underneath the remote village?<br>
==F: Yes I am.<br>
==G: Right underneath ... the {le|v} in {ci|village} ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: You have to go about an inch and a half past that ... towards the east ... and you will hit a finish point ... if you don't have that {ab|m} labelled on your map.<br>
==F: I don't, {ph|aaand=and} I'm done!<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}!  There you go!<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Ready?  You got a start point?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Right beside a burnt forest?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: All right.  See the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest}?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Draw a line from {ci|start} to {le|b}.  Standard distance away from the {le|b}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have something below the burnt forest?<br>
==F: Carpenter's cottage.<br>
==G: I want you to curve around it.  Do you have a ravine?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to go above the ravine ... so you're curving underneath whatever you just told me ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: going standard distance above those birds ...<br>
==F: So you want me to go under the carpenter's cottage or over?<br>
==G: Under.<br>
==F: Okay.  Got you.<br>
==G: {ab|Ha} ...<br>
==F: And in between the ravine there?<br>
==G: In between the ravine and the remote village.  Do you have a remote village?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is stay ... just a bit above standard ... {fp|er} distance above those birds ...<br>
==F: Birds?<br>
==G: {br|O of=Of} ... in the ravine ...<br>
==F: Birds.<br>
==G: Two ... birds.<br>
==F: Okay.  Above them?<br>
==G: Above them.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Just a bit above standard.  Now what I want you to do is ... Do you have a pine grove?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: See those ... the top of the trees?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Go over about two inches ... from the top of the trees ...<br>
==F: {ab|O} ... Okay.<br>
==G: put a point ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: connect those two points that I just ... gave you ...<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm over top of the pine grove.<br>
==G: {fp|Er} you shouldn't be.<br>
==F: {gg|Uh-oh}.<br>
==G: Two inches ... left of the ... pine grove ... make a point.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: At the height of the {fp|er} top of the trees.<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: Now connect the points from above the birds to ... that point I just gave you.<br>
==F: Okay.  Got you.<br>
==G: Now.  See the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to make a point ... {fp|er} just a bit left of the {le|p} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: standard distance away ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: from the bottom of the {le|p}, {ph|aaand=and} join those last two points.  Do you have something ... just a bit southwest of pine grove?<br>
==F: Southwest?  Yeah, I got a ... {ab|till=tilled} ...<br>
==G: Like almost ... right underneath, but ... just a bit to the left.<br>
==F: Of pine {ph|grovevv=grove}?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, nothing ... immediately ... southwest, no.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do ... Do you have anything southeast of there?<br>
==F: Southeast?  {gg|Oh}.<br>
==G: Like a cavern or something ...<br>
==F: Avalanche.<br>
==G: Avalanche.  That's what I {ab|wa} {ab|remem} ... I've seen this before. {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do is do the same thing you did last time.<br>
==F: {gg|Oh}, okay.  I remember that.<br>
==G: Remember that?  That backward {le|c} ... turning into a {le|c}?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, going which direction?<br>
==G: Okay, so you get the backward {le|c} ... curving ... southwest ... so it starts ... Fuck! It starts ... from the {le|p} ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: {ph|Aaaand=And} it should curve ... to your right ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and end up ... underneath the {le|g} ... in {ci|pine grove}.  But you should be about three inches down.  Two and a half inches down.<br>
==F: I'm doing a backward {le|c} here, right?<br>
==G: Backward {le|c}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now, do you have a concealed hideout?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: I want you to go round there.  Do you have a boat house?  Not the one on the bottom but the one in the middle of the page.<br>
==F: Go around there, on the outside?<br>
==G: On the outside of it to the right, yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Standard distance away, blah blah blah.<br>
==F: Yeah, yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have a boat house?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: But not on the {ab|bott} {ab|n} ... Like in the middle {ph|ssort=sort} of the page?<br>
==F: No.  I got it right beside crane bay.<br>
==G: All right.<br>
==F: Out of the way.<br>
==G: Do you remember where the boat house was last time?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}. No but I know ... I know where you're going.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go an ... a half an {ab|i} ... or three-quarters of an inch away from the {ci|concealed} part of {ci|concealed hideout}.  Like, from the {le|c} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: staying on that line, put a point, and go due ... south ...<br>
==F: Fuck!<br>
==G: until you're into that little ... bit of a curve ... of the {ab|coco=coconut} of the {br|c crane=crane} bay ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: follow the curve up to that one point, curve down.  Now, there's going to be a coconut palm there.  Do {ab|yo} ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I got {fp|er} pebbled shore and washed stones.<br>
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is ... go ... Where's the washed stones? To the left of pebbled shore?<br>
==F: No.  Just {fp|er} directly {fp|er} beneath it.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well, don't worry about that then.  {fp|Erm} ... I want you to come {ph|mum mum mum uh} ... You don't have that.  Fuck!  {fp|Erm} ... Fuck!  I want you to ... go above pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: from {fp|er} ... that lip ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and I want you to come down ... underneath whatever you just told me that you had ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: And ... that's where you finish.  About {ph|aaaan=an} inch and a half away from the flagship, the bottom of the flagship.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Got me?<br>
==F: Got you.<br>
==G: Done.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Kim.  Ready?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Seen your parked van?  Like, you have a start over top of your camera shop, correct?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, yes I do.<br>
==G: See your parked van?<br>
==F: My parked van is at the very top north ...<br>
==G: {fp|Er}, is there another parked van ...<br>
==F: No there is not.<br>
==G: down south of the camera shop?<br>
==F: {fg|Oh} no.  I have a little ... area called {ci|allotments} ...<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: to {ph|sss} the southeast of my camera shop ...<br>
==G: Now ... Now, what I want you to do is go down ... {ip|bout=about} {ab|thr} ... {fg|mm} two and a half inches, down from your camera shop ...<br>
==F: {ab|R} ...<br>
==G: at the bottom of the letters ... two and a half inches {ab|dow} ...<br>
==F: Am I going on the left side or the right?<br>
==G: Just ... put a dot for now.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, a dot, okay.<br>
==G: Right in the middle where the {le|a} is, two and a half down from the bottom of that {le|a}.  You should be about ...<br>
==F: I'm ...<br>
==G: an equal distance in between there and the border.  Between the camera shop and the border.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: Okay!<br>
==G: Look roughly good to you?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now, what we're going to do is we got to ...<br>
==F: Wait!  {br|I is=is} my dot ... Can you give me ... it in reference to the allotments?<br>
==G: It it will be on a {ab|sou} ... Okay.  At your dot looking up, it's northeast to your allotments.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh} okay.<br>
==G: It's directly underneath the {le|a} in {ci|camera shop}, the middle {le|a} ...<br>
==F: I know, but I just didn't go down far enough.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, I want you to do is one of our famous ... stringy {le|c}'s ...<br>
==F: {gg|Ah}, I can ...<br>
==G: until you get there.<br>
==F: I can do a stringy {le|c}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Got it?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Done?<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: Okay, go up to your allotments ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: about ... {fp|erm} ... a smidgen ... over top of the allotments, of that one barn that's on the ... left-hand corner, put another dot.<br>
==F: Am I going straight ... or kind of curved up there?<br>
==G: {br|Y you're=You're} curving up there but I'm just telling you to put a dot there for now ... and I want you to go roughly an inch out and put another little ... semi-dot ...<br>
==F: An inch out in what direction?<br>
==G: From your parked van.  Like from that last dot I gave you, like, the first dot I gave you.<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: An inch out ... and I want you to do a gradual ... it'll almost look like a {le|j} curve ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: up to that ... point.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Criss-crossing through that other point so you don't ... hit the van.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Are you there?<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  It should kinda look like a {le|g} now . Now ...<br>
==F: Sort of.<br>
==G: you're going to head in a {br|north east=northeast} east direction. That's right in between northeast and ...<br>
==F: Yes, I knew that.<br>
==G: east.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, and you're going to go about six inches, or right underneath the abandoned monastery, but down ... about ... four inches from there.<br>
==F: Is it halfway between the abandoned monastery and the flight museum?<br>
==G: {fg|Erm} ... halfway in between ... the monastery and the bottom of the yacht club.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}!<br>
==G: So that'd probably be right beside it.<br>
==F: It is right beside it.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Now, from allotments to there, I'm going in ...<br>
==G: a northeast east direction ...<br>
==F: northeast east ...<br>
==G: to those two points ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: like just to that one point, and stop there.<br>
==F: I'm {ab|th} ... I'm there.<br>
==G: Now ... see ... You have your abandoned monastery?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: I want you to just do a gradual curve over top of that and stop at the beginning of it.  You know, where the {le|a} is.  So you're going ...<br>
==F: Is it {ab|i} ...<br>
==G: north ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: and then turning west and then coming down southwest and then stopping right by the {le|a}.<br>
==F: I'm going north ... then west ...<br>
==G: Right, you're going up ...<br>
==F: Yes?<br>
==G: and {br|ar round=around} ... the abandoned monastery ... counterclockwise.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, are you there?<br>
==F: No, I haven't {ab|e} ... I'm {ab|ju} ... Okay, I'm going up north towards the abandoned monastery ...<br>
==G: Keep on going until you are around the {br|ab bandoned=abandoned} monastery.<br>
==F: And then I go west?<br>
==G: Like up that five inches ...<br>
==F: Then I go {ab|wes} ...<br>
==G: Just go ...<br>
==F: {ph|A} ...<br>
==G: loop around the abandoned monastery ...<br>
==F: Loop ...<br>
<a name="40">-2G: and stop at the {le|a}.<br>
-1F: In {ci|monastery}?<br>
<b>-0G: No.  The first {le|a} ...<br>
</b>+1F: {fg|Oh}!<br>
+2G: {ci|abandoned}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So you should ... {ph|of=have} already looped over top of it?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: So ... the north face is all covered with a loop?<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: Now ... this is kind of tricky.  Do you have an alpine garden?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Do you have anything below your alpine garden?<br>
==F: West lake.<br>
==G: Okay.  That's ... off past where we're going.  Do you have anything in between ... alpha garden and the abandoned monastery?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, well there's nothing here but we have to do a curve ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: a bit bigger than a pop can ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then ... you'll go straight up the side of ...<br>
==F: Left side?<br>
==G: {ab|alp} ... Yes.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: The left-hand side of alpine garden, and stop ... right at the top of alpine garden.<br>
==F: Okay, I can do that.<br>
==G: So, it's kind of like a {le|c} on its side almost ...<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what we're going to do, is we're doing a reverse ... Do you have a youth hostel?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, well go over ... about an ... inch and a bit ... until you're on the other side of your alpine garden.  So you ... at the northeast corner of it.  Do you understand?<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now ... Connect that line.<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: And now go north two inches.<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: Now, go over ... east ... one inch.<br>
==F: There.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, now we're going to be going in a southeast direction. Do you have a telephone box?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Right to that {le|t}.  Just go straight to that {le|t}.  Nice straight line.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, now do a ... kind of like an underline ... of {ci|telephone box} ...<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: and stop at the {le|x} in {ci|box}.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do now ... Do you have {ph|thratched=thatched} mud hut?<br>
==F: No.  Directly ... northwest of this ... telephone box I have level crossing.<br>
==G: Okay, that's ... that's out of the way.<br>
==F: I have no thatched anything.<br>
==G: Okay.  Basically, above the telephone box ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: about two inches is a thatched, mud hut.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So, what you're going to have to do ... is we're going up on the right-hand side ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So get to the top of the telephone box ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: like, on the top right, the northeast corner ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: and then angle in a northwest direction ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.<br>
==G: {ab|graduall} ... and do one of those {le|s} kind of curves ... and ...<br>
==F: Okay, where will I end up?<br>
==G: where I want you to end up ... This is where I want you to end up. ... is about a quarter of an inch away ... from east lake ... but in between those two points.  See the one that's the southernmost point?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: See the one that's ... closest to your alpine garden? The one that's pointing to it?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: You should be aiming right for the middle of there.<br>
==F: {ph|S} ... {gg|Uh-oh}.<br>
==G: Stop about ... {ph|quarterrr=quarter} to half an inch out.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, Okay.<br>
==G: Right.  Pretend there's an object in the way you have to get around.<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now your finish ... is about half an inch ... towards your alpine garden from that east lake point.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  From that ... one that's directly {ab|bet} ... the closest one to alpine garden.<br>

==F: No.  My banana tree is {fp|er} to the left ... at nine o'clock, at about {ph|pfth} four inches.<br>

==F: Yes.<br>
==G: where the picture ends ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: you go {ph|awwn=on} a ... south ... trajectory, but you're still going west a bit ...<br>

==G: so it looks like you're going under the {fp|er} ... banana trees, okay?  Now ... do you have a rope bridge?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  At about {fp|er} ... seven o'clock ... {fp|er} ... {ip|bout=about} inch an a half away, there's {fp|er} gorillas.<br>

==F: Right where the river bends there?<br>
==G: Sorry?<br>
==F: The rope bridge, seven o'clock ... Okay.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
<a name="42">-2G: until {fp|er} ... {ip|til=until} you reach ... you reach the gorillas. Now you want to ... You want to stay on the left-hand side of the gorillas.<br>

==F: Okay?<br>
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.<br>
==F: So I {ab|wa} ... Stay to the left of the gorillas?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Stay to the left, and {fp|er} soon as you pass the gorillas ... you go straight north ... until you're you're level with the rope bridge ...<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: then you {fp|er} ... you go east ... and you go across, and you go right across the rope bridge ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Now do you have anything right after the rope bridge, like directly right after the rope ...<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Okay.  What you do is then you {fp|er} ... drop down about a centimetre south ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: and you keep on your same {ph|trjr} trajectory going {fp|er} ... {fp|er} east ... of the ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I have a waterfall, at the far east.<br>
==G: Yeah {ab|o}.  Yeah.  Okay.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: go due north, straight up.<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, now ... At about eleven o'clock from the waterfall I have {fp|er} lost steps ... which is about ...<br>
==F: Lost steps?<br>
==G: two inches away.  Yeah.<br>
==F: No, I don't have that.<br>

==F: {fp|Er}, no.<br>
==G: Okay.  Right there, there's lost steps.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Now what you want to do is, when you {fp|er} ... {ab|whe} when you're going north just before the waterfall ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: you keep to the right of the lost steps, so {ab|bas} ... you're straight up ...<br>
==F: Yeah.  Okay, I'm to ... {ab|r} ...<br>
==G: You go straight up and you {ab|g} ... you'll stay to the right of it ...<br>
==F: I'm at the top of the lost steps now.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, {fp|er} to {fp|er} ... About nine o'clock ... do you have {fp|er} fallen pillars?  From the lost steps, pardon me.<br>
==F: Yeah, I {ab|ha} ... Yes, I do.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>

==G: Okay.  Now do you have anything {ph|aat=at} about seven o'clock from the fallen pillars?<br>
==F: I have the flamingoes.<br>
==G: You have flamingoes ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What you do is, then {fp|er} ... You go left ... or {ab|par} correction {fp|er} ... You go west from the lost steps ...<br>
==F: Across the top, right?<br>
==G: Yeah.  {ab|You} you're still on top of the lost steps.<br>
==F: And about parallel with the fallen pillars?<br>
==G: Yeah.  And about half way in between the lost steps and the fallen pillars you go {ab|d} ... you start angling down on a {ph|south_uh_west=southwest} trajectory ...<br>
==F: Southwest {ab|tr} ... So I just ... go by the bottom {fp|er} right-hand corner of the fallen pillars?<br>
==G: Yeah.  And then you straighten right out as soon as you {fp|er} ... you come in line with the {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: {ab|F} ...<br>
==G: beginning of the fallen pillars.<br>
==F: The bottom of them, right?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Okay, I'm going across the bottom of the fallen pillars now ...<br>
==G: Okay.  Now looks like what we want to do is, you want to go south, and you want to hook around the flamingoes.  You want to go underneath, and stay to the left of the flamingoes.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: So I've gone all the way round the flamingoes?<br>
==G: {ab|A} ...<br>

==F: So you ...<br>
==G: So you angle towards, and you keep to the left, of the ancient ruins.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the ancient ruins now.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now, twelve o'clock, directly twelve o'clock about {fp|er} ... again three, three inches away, do you have stones?<br>
==F: Okay.  Reference the three birds at the top of ruined city ...<br>

==F: Straight north, so I'm on the left side of ruined city still?<br>
==G: Yeah.  And then you go straight, and I guess {fp|er} ... You have the rock fall there.  You just want to swoop around to the right so you're right on top of the rock fall.<br>

==G: Okay.  I want you to go down the left-hand side of crest falls ... to the bottom of crest falls ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: then go left, under your banana tree ... and up the left-hand side ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay?  Then go up ... {ab|i} ... to the footbridge ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay?  And cross the footbridge.<br>

==F: Okay.<br>
==G: then go left ... a couple of inches ... Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now.  Do you have white mountain?<br>

==G: Okay.<br>
==F: I have a poisoned stream ...<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==F: and directly above ... {fp|er} white mountain I have a lemon grove.<br>

==G: and left across the bottom ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and stop at the {fp|er} edge there ... Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {fg|Erm}, I have a cobbled street between pyramid and remote village.<br>
==F: I have {fp|er} nothing.<br>
<a name="51">-2G: Okay.  So {fg|erm}, go ... left and {ab|s} ... and down, like on a ... bit of a slant ... and then down the {ab|l} ... to the left-hand corner of remote village ...<br>
-1F: {fg|Er}, do I cross {ph|theeee} ... {fp|er} ... cobbled street?<br>

</b>+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: the left-hand edge of it ... is just a little bit ... past the corner of the pyramid.  So go out a little bit ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  And then, come down ... to {fp|er} ... remote village ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: the left-hand side ... Okay?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And go straight ... under ... remote village ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and ... just to the right, is your finish. That's it.<br>
==F: The end.<br>
==G: Okay, Adam.  Reference your start point.<br>
==F: Seen.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have anything ... Do you have any landmarks right below it, like, in the ... in the line there?<br>
==F: No, all I have is burnt forest off to the right.<br>
==G: Then do you have anything below that?<br>
==F: I have {ab|c} carpenter's cottage right below, like an inch below {fp|uh} burnt forest.<br>
==G: Okay.  And you have nothing to the left of carpenter cottage.<br>
==F: Nothing.<br>
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is {fp|uh} ... Reference your start {ab|poi} ... Okay {fp|uh} actually, reference carpenter cottage.  To {fp|uh} the right of it, an inch away, do you have anything there?<br>
==F: I have a ravine.<br>
==G: Okay, right above it, do you have anything?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: The ravine.  You have nothing above the ravine?<br>
==F: Nothing.<br>
==G: Okay, so about {fp|uh} ... an inch away from the burnt forest you have a remote village.<br>
==F: Remote village?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: So there's four of them in a little square there?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: Okay.  You got your starting point?<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: What you do is {fp|uh} you go south, but you head towards the burnt forest a bit.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: And as as soon as ... Like, you you start aiming {ab|k} ... aiming towards the {le|b} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And as soon as your {fp|uh} pen ... like {ab|yo} ... As soon as the ink {fp|uh} comes in the same line as it, you start curving the opposite way and what you want to do is you want to swing out and, looks like, keep to the left of carpenter cottage, {ip|til=until} you get to the bottom of it, make a sharp right, go east ... until {fp|uh} ... you're right below the {le|e} in {fp|uh} the word {ci|forest} ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: then what you do is you go {fp|uh} up on a {fp|uh} northeast trajectory, and you go up above the ravine, as soon as you're on top of the ravine {ab|yo} you make a sharp right.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: And so {fp|uh} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {fp|uh} pine grove?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, what you do is {fp|uh} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're in between the ravine and the remote village, you go about an inch, inch and a half, then what you do is {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... go ... southeast down towards the pine grove ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: And as soon as you {fp|uh} ... As soon as your pen comes in the same line as the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: you swing out to the right ... Okay, do you have anything right below the pine grove?<br>
==F: Avalanche.<br>
<a name="52">-2G: You have an avalanche?<br>
-1F: Do you have an avalanche?<br>
<b>-0G: No I don't.  That's what it is.  Okay, you want to swing out {ab|arou} ...<br>
</b>+1F: {fg|Oh}, hang on a sec ... avalanche.  Reference {fp|uh} the {le|e} in {ci|pine grove}, the last {le|e}?<br>
+2G: Yeah.<br>
==F: It's {fp|uh} five o'clock.  It's about an inch away, so it's close to the edge of the paper.<br>
==G: {fg|Oh}, okay, it's on the other side!<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, well, looks like what you want to do is you want to ... swing towards it, yet you don't want to go around it, so you want to swing towards it, but you want to keep to the left side of the avalanche.<br>
==F: Okay, so ... sorry, hang on a second.  I've got ... I'm in level with the {le|p}, right?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Of {ci|pine grove} ...<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: And I swing to the south now?<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, {ab|y} you're swinging towards ... {ab|Y} You're still going south but {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... Basically, look at a pregnant lady sideways, at her abdomen, the way that it is ...<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: How it juts out and then {ab|i} it swoops back in ...<br>
==F: So is she {ab|l} ... {ab|Wh} ... Is her belly facing the bottom of the paper?<br>
==G: Her her belly's facing towards the {fp|uh} the edge of the paper where the avalanche is.<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay, seen.<br>
==G: So you ... So you swing back out and then you ... {ab|whe} when you ... when you {ph|sig} swing back in, you should be right below the {le|r} in {ci|pine grove} ...<br>
==F: So all ... I go all the way out towards the avalanche, then?  With this pregnant belly?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: And I come back?<br>
==G: You come back in, yeah.<br>
==F: Below the {le|r}?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay, so you're at the {le|r}.  Okay now, below the avalanche you have a {ab|c} a concealed hideout?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay, you want to do the exact same thing, you want to swing out to the right ... Actually, yeah, you ... Okay, {ab|thi} this one you want to encircle so {ab|y} you go over top of it and you hook around ...<br>
==F: I go between avalanche and concealed hideout?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: And I go ... do a buttonhook around concealed hideout.<br>
==G: {ab|Button} ... Yeah.  And then you go straight across so you're going straight west.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading west.<br>
<a name="53">-2G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...<br>
-1F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.<br>

==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I don't have that.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==F: I got it now.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: See where the {le|b} and the {le|a} is?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Directly above you got, like, a {ab|p} a peak?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  As you swing around the concealed hideout you're going straight ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Soon as you reach that peak ...<br>
==F: {ab|Y} ...<br>
==G: you you like drop straight down and you follow that curve, going around, until you get to, like, the top of the {le|c}.  In the word {ci|crane}.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: So you just follow the contour.<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm there.  I'm at the {ab|t} ...<br>
==G: Okay now do you have a coconut palm to the left of you?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>

==G: Okay, the coconut palm is one o'clock about a {ab|ha} ... three-quarter inch away.<br>
==F: {ab|Cocon} ...<br>
==G: So {ab|ba} basically all's you want to do is you just want to go in between the coconut palm and the pebbled shore.  So {ab|i} {ab|w} ... if you swoop down ...<br>
==F: {ab|A} ...<br>
==G: and just skim across top the ... of the pebbled shore you'll miss the coconut palm.<br>
==F: So I skim the shoreline a little bit longer?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Go underneath the coconuts ...<br>
==G: Go ... Yeah.<br>
==F: And above the pebbled shore?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the top there then.<br>

==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: So I drop down?<br>
==G: Yeah, so basically you swing around pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And pretty much you're going diagonally down until you come in {ab|b} ... I guess ... line with the top of that {fp|uh} washed stones ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Then you buttonhook right around ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And your finish ... your finish {le|x} is about one centimetre away from the {ab|f} {fp|uh} the shore.  Directly in line with the flagship.<br>

==F: No I do not.<br>
==G: Okay.  So what you want to do is take that line east until you ... and then ... {ab|hea} {fp|uh} ... curve up the left-hand side side of the public {ph|tootpath=footpath} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And take {fp|uh} ... And then then turn {ab|r} east for about an inch and a half.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay. Now do you have anything directly north of you?  You should have a {ab|cornfiel} ...<br>
==F: Cornfield.<br>
==G: Cornfield, okay.  Now do you have fallen cairns?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>

==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Yes it is.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do is take the line where you stopped ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: go directly southeast until you come to the {le|f} in {ci|{ab|fa}} ... just off the {le|f} in {ci|fallen cairn} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then turn east and head straight underneath {fp|uh} ... go east underneath fallen cairn ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then up the right-hand side, until you come level with the rocks ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you want to turn northwest and go {br|i in=in} a northwesterly direction for about two inches ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Now, you notice up in east lake there's {fp|uh} ... in the bottom shore there's sort of two little {fp|uh} hump type lines there?<br>

==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do with that line that you just stopped, you want to be in line with the {ab|r} {fp|uh} rightmost edge of the rightmost hump, okay?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Head straight up until you're about half a centimetre away from the edge of the shoreline ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Turn northwest and follow along the shoreline keeping off about half a centimetre ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you know where you'll come to a {fp|uh} ... where the {fp|uh} lake will a {ab|n} a a northerly {fp|uh} swing ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Go about {fp|uh} an inch past that and that's your finish mark.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  Done.<br>
==G: Okay ... {fg|er} Mark.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Start line is just above crest falls.<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  To the {fp|er} left of crest falls is there anything there?<br>
==F: {fg|Erm} ... Far west of page I have a banana tree.<br>
==G: Okay.  A banana tree.  Okay.  Where the start line is ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: you're going to ... You're going to take the line and you're going to go {fp|er} ... west {ab|a} ... Then you're going to arc it down {ph|don=on} the {fp|er} ... {ab|we} {fp|er} west side of {fp|er} crest falls ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: not touching the falls at all.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You're going to get about three-quarters of the way down ... Right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And the ... the line starts to {fp|er} curve ... {fp|er} {br|south west=southwest} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And you're going to go below the banana tree ... {fp|er} so so the line's parallel ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: **NEW SFO READING REQUIRED with the word {ci|crest falls} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  You're going to continue that line for about {fp|er} ... four inches ... until you're about {fp|er} two inches from the edge of the page ...<br>
==F: Okay.  So I've passed banana tree ...<br>
==G: Yeah.  Just just go directly underneath it so you'd miss it.<br>
==F: Okay.  And I'm two inches from ... west border of page?  Okay.<br>
==G: Yes.  Okay.  Stop there.  Now, do you have a footbridge?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: And you have a poisoned stream?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  Don't worry about that.  Okay. Right where the line stops ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: two inches from the page, I want you to start {fp|er} ... arcing the line, so you're going north ... straight up for about ... two inches ...<br>
==F: Okay.  That'll take me about even with the top of the tree.<br>

==F: {fg|Er} ... The tree is ... about an inch ... southwest of the footbridge.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well that's perfect, then.  Okay.  Continue that line ... so that you miss the {fp|er} banana tree completely ...<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Little bits of sand.  Okay.  You'll you'll be about a quarter of an inch above that before you start arcing the line ... up, over the pyramid ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  You're going to come down ... the east ... face of the pyramid, following the the the shape of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: About how far from the pyramid?<br>
==G: {fg|Oh} about ... quarter of an inch.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  You're going to come ... And then you're going to stop at the {fp|er} bottom right ... {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.  I'm there.<br>
==G: part of the pyramid, and you're going to arc the line so you come below the word {ci|pyramid} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and you're going to come to the {fp|er} left edge ... bottom, of the pyramid, and stop there ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  You have cobbled street below that?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Do you have remote village?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Okay.  Cobbled street and remote village and the pyramid, they're all pretty well in line.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: So I want you to take that line, and continue it ... I ... another ... quarter of an inch, out past the {fp|er} bottom left of {ph|theee=the} pyramid ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  And then from there, take that line and and arc it ever so ... slightly, so that you come ... straight down south ... {ip|til=until} you get to the {fp|er} left ... side ... of {fp|er} remote village, the top ... part ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  And you're going to take that line and you're going to go ... directly underneath the word {ci|remote village} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You'll be about {fp|er} quarter of an inch away from the {fp|er} actual word ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and your finish line is about ... half an inch ... past that east side of remote village.  Actually where the {le|e} is in {ci|village} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: your finish line is about half an inch past that, about a quarter of an inch down.  Okay?<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have a start?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: It's beside a burnt forest?<br>
==F: Yes it is.<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, to the right of the ... or to the east of the burnt forest do you have a remote village?<br>
==F: Say again.<br>
==G: Do you ... To the east of a burnt forest do you have an {ab|ea} ... a remote village?<br>
==F: No I do not.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have {fp|uh} a ravine {br|south east=southeast} ... of the burnt forest?<br>
==F: Yes I do.  And directly south I have carpenter's cottage.<br>
==G: Carpenter's cottage.  Okay, do you have a {fp|uh} pine grove to the east of the ravine?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have a concealed hideout to the south?<br>

==F: I have tiled land.<br>
==G: Okay, do you ...<br>
==F: {fg|Oh}, excuse me!  Tilled land.<br>

==F: {fp|Uh}, of tilled land?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: {ab|oka} ... Or of the burnt forest?<br>
==F: I have carpenter's cottage to the south.<br>
==G: Okay.  Okay ...<br>
==F: Between tilled land and burnt forest.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay, here we go, fast and furious.  So from your start ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Go ... in a southeasterly direction ... Go {fp|uh} about an inch and a half two inches so you're just from the start to past the letter {le|b}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then go southwest for about ... {fp|uh} ... two and a half inches, passing on the left side of your carpenter's {fp|uh} whatever there.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now your line should stop so you're just in line with the {fp|uh} ... or just above the {le|r} in {ci|ravine} ...<br>
==F: The {le|r} in {ci|ravine}, yes.  Okay.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Now take that over until you're about an inch and a half away from the {le|r} in {ci|ravine} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Take that over east, sorry.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now head ... northeast, up the left face of the ravine ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|til=until} you're just about half a centimetre over those two little birds that are ... flying there.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go east for about {fp|uh} ... {ph|mm-one=one} two ... about two and a half inches ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you should be {fp|uh} {br|i in=in} line with the top of those trees ...<br>
==F: {ph|Aw} ...<br>
==G: {fp|Uh}, the pine grove ...<br>
==F: Pine grove!<br>
==G: Yeah.  Do you have {ab|pi} ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: You have pine grove?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Okay.  Turn southeast ... and head directly towards the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} passing off the left-hand side of the pine grove and you should stop {ab|y} when you're about half centimetre away from pine grove ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now this is where it kind of gets {ab|c} ... This is the only little {fp|uh} {ab|g} {fp|uh} {ab|croo} crooked part about it but ... {ab|Y} ... Now you'll turn ... {fp|uh} a {ab|f} ... a sharper southeast in towards your avalanche, but then as you get close to it, turn away from it.  And the diameter that you're turning is about the size of a silver dollar ... And then as soon as you come out of that you're going to immediately ... turn away from the avalanche ... {fp|uh} ... and that diameter in is is about the size of a dime but you'll be passing over the top of the hideout or the concealed hideout ... You see what I'm ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: You see what I'm saying there?<br>
==F: So I go {ab|sou} ... I go southeast in a ... semi-circle fashion ...<br>
==G: Yeah, southeast in a semi-circle ... You're going to turn southeast, and proceed in a semi-circle fashion ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: until you're coming out of your semi-circle and then you're going to turn into another reverse semi-circle ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and then you're going to go over the top of the hideout ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: around the right-hand side and underneath ... the {fp|uh} ... the concealed hideout.<br>
==F: Okay.  I I see, yes ... Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  So where are you now?<br>
==F: I'm underneath the {le|c} ...<br>
==G: {fg|Ah} ...<br>
==F: in {ci|concealed}.<br>
==G: Okay, good.  Do you have a boathouse to your left?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, I have a boathouse ... below ...<br>
==G: {ab|Be} ...<br>
==F: concealed hideout.<br>
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is go ... approximately three-quarters of an inch past the letter {le|c} in {ci|concealed} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: or the first letter {ab|concea} ... or first letter {le|c} ... and stop.  You should be just past ... the {fp|uh} ... {fp|uh} {fp|um} ... Do you know where the little point is?<br>
==F: Yes.  Yes.<br>
==G: Yeah.  Above the letter {le|a}?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: You should be just about half a centimetre past that.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, now what you're going to do is head ... Take your line straight down towards the bay ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you're going to follow along the shoreline heading sort of out ... {ab|y} ... The the shoreline part that's heading out into the bay.  But you're you're just going to follow {ph|thlong=along} the shoreline ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ab|Cl} ... Hug the shoreline really close, until you come out of {ab|tha} {fp|uh} out of that {fp|uh} area just above the letter {le|c} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Keep on hugging the shoreline heading down until you come ... {fp|uh} ... Do {ab|y} ... You have pebbled shore?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: You're going to pass ... You're going to take a {ab|l} {fp|uh} west turn, and you're going to pass off close to the top of pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, and then you're going to take ... Do you have anything {fp|uh} {ab|b} {fp|uh} below pebbled shore?<br>
==F: Yes, I have washed stones.<br>
==G: Washed stones.  Okay, what you're going to do is you're going to {ab|pa} ... Do you have anything {fp|uh} ... to the {fp|uh} northeast or to the west of {fp|uh} pebbled shore?<br>
==F: To the west of pebbled shore?  No I do not.<br>
==G: Okay.  What you're going to do is you're going to pass off to the left going down the left-hand side ... of {fp|uh} pebbled shore ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {fp|uh} for about three inches.  And then head ... You're going to take {fp|uh} ... You're going to pass down the left-hand side of {fp|uh} {ab|s} washed stones ... So you're going to go in another large {fp|uh} semi-circle fashion ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Now you see that inlet where the flagship is?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: About ... half an inch west from the centre of the inlet ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>

==F: Yeah, and I also have {fp|erm} ...<br>
==G: Flagship?<br>
==F: Washed ... Yeah.  I have {fp|er} ... a thing called {ci|washed stones} between flagship and pebbled shore.  {ph|Kkk} ... It's {fp|erm} two fingers away from that dip, above the ship ... to the west.<br>
==G: {ph|Mmkay=Okay}.  All right.  Come down the west side, towards towards the {le|b} in {ci|burnt} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and then ... do a little hook.  I don't know if there's ... Do you have something there?<br>
==F: Yeah.  I have a carpenter's cottage.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go {ab|ar} ... to the east around ... your cottage there ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>

==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Erm} ...<br>
==F: You want me to go round my tilled land, you said.  Right?<br>
==G: Tilled {ab|lan} ... How far down's your tilled land?<br>
==F: {fp|Erm}, it starts at three fingers down from the carpenter's cottage ...<br>
=-G: Okay.  No.  I don't want you to go round ... there.<br>
==F: {ab|Ok} ... Okay.  Just go underneath the ravine, then?<br>
=-G: No, no.  I said, go under your cottage ... and go between your cottage and the ravine.  Go up ... Go up in between those two ... and then go underneath the remote village.  But you don't have the remote village. {ph|tu-tu-tuu} ... It's {fp|er} ...<br>
==F: {gg|Oh} ...<br>
==G: Draw a line ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I got you.<br>

==G: and then just go straight across towards the tips of {fp|er} the the pine grove ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and then go down the west sides of those ... And then you go around something.  I don't know what that is.<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, it's my avalanche site.<br>
==G: Okay.  {ph|Gooo=Go} to the {ab|ea} ... around it to the east ... And then ... Do you have something else there too?<br>
==F: Just a concealed hideout, it's called.<br>
==G: Okay.  Well go down around ... {fg|Oh}, wait a minute. Where's your {fp|um} ... your thing in relationship to the grove?  Your pine grove.<br>
==F: It's {fp|erm} to the east ... {fp|er} two fingers, and it starts at two fingers down ... and it's about three fingers wide.<br>
==G: {fp|Erm}, where is it, like?  Is it right underneath the pine grove?<br>
==F: No.  It's {fp|er} off to the ...<br>

==F: to the east.<br>
==G: Okay.  Go ...<br>
==F: See where the {le|e} is, in {ci|grove}?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: If you go down three fingers, that's where the start of it begins.  And it goes over ...<br>
==G: To the west.  Okay.  Just go around that.  Around ... the concealed hideout ... towards the boathouse ...<br>

=-G: No.<br>
==F: The {le|b} in {ci|crane} ... Okay.  I have a boathouse ... you know ... {fp|um} ... the far right-hand side of crane bay, where it goes off the paper.<br>
=-G: Yeah.  Yeah.  No, {ab|I} ... This one isn't.<br>
==F: Or ...<br>
==G: Okay.  It's {fp|er} ... two fingers, okay, to the ... rightmost point ... right above {le|a} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: in {ci|bay}.  Okay.  Go two fingers directly above that ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>

==F: Okay.  So I'm going to go right under concealed hideout ...<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: like ...<br>
==G: One ... {ip|bout=about} one finger width past the {le|c} ... and then head straight down to that point ... right above {fp|er} the bay there. And then follow that little ravine there, the cut ... in the bay.<br>

==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Draw an {le|x} and that's your finish line.<br>
==F: Okay.  Finished.<br>
==G: Okay.  You have your {le|x} above the camp, right?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  You want to go straight left, for about ... centimetre and a half.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Then you're going to {ph|llloop=loop} down, to a point ... parallel to the words {ci|missionary camp} ... and about ... three centimetres over.  And on your way down you're going to pass {ip|bout=about} half a centimetre away from the missionary camp. Tent.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: So you're going to loop down a half centimetre away from the tent and start to be parallel.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Crossing towards the missionary camp. Okay, from there ... You have a banana tree in the left-hand corner?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
<a name="69">-2G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.<br>
-1F: Below the writing?<br>
<b>-0G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre below the writing.<br>

+2G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.<br>
==F: Under the leaf?<br>
==G: {fp|Uh} {ph|bii} {ph|puh} right underneath the {ab|t} base of the tree.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now what we're going to do is we're going to circle around the left-hand edge of the trees, up and across the river.  So what we're going to do is we're going to stay about a half a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the tree ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And we're going to move up and we're going to go {ph|thththrough=through} the bridge, like across the bridge.<br>
==F: The rope bridge?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, so stay a half a centimetre away from the tree and gently loop up {fg|aw} it's about six seven centimetres ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: And then gradually ... turn to the right, right through the rope bridge.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay and when you get to the other side ... you're going to {ab|co} ...<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: You're going to come out about a half a centimetre ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: And then you're going to go down about a centimetre ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  And now ... Do you have anything left of the waterfall?<br>
==F: No I don't.<br>
==G: Okay.  We're going to go ... to a point ... I'm {ab|go} ... like, I'm going to give you a point and tell you where to go.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, it's about five centimetres to the right of where we are now ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And about a half a centimetre above that.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: It's ... It's on the left-hand side of the waterfall there.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: We're going to go to there.  Just {ab|ea} ... gently ease up there ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, now we're about a half a {ab|c} ... well, maybe a quarter centimetre away from the left-hand edge of the top of the waterfall.<br>
==F: {ip|Bout=About} a centimetre away, you said?<br>
==G: {ip|Bout=About} a half a centimetre.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, and then we're going to go straight up, keeping about half a centimetre away from the waterfall, up to ... third ... what are they, marked {ci|pillars} on yours?<br>
==F: Fallen pillars?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to go straight up to there, {ip|til=until} we're about ... and keep about a half a centimetre away from them on the right ... until you're right at the top of them, and then stop there.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay, are you still on the right-hand side?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  What we're going to do is we're going to loop over top of them, and ... Do you {ab|ha} ... Do you {ab|ha} ... Do you have {br|f fallen=fallen} pillars?  Off to the left?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} that's like {fp|uh} what I'm at right now.  I have ... Fallen pillars is where I am.<br>
==G: Okay, {ab|wh} what do you have to the right of there?<br>
==F: To the right of fallen pillars?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Empty space.<br>
==G: You don't have anything to the right of fallen pillars?<br>
==F: Nothing at all. Should there be pillars there?<br>
==G: I have lost steps, straight above the waterfall and to the left.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, we're going to backtrack.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Okay. Back to where we were below the waterfall?<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: We're going to go straight up ... about eight centimetres.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, then we're going to ... gradually turn to the left ... and we're going to go ... go up another half a centimetre ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And then ease your way over to the left, about four centimetres away.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, now we're going to start to {ab|g} ... turn down again ... and the next turning point, from where we are, is about ... one centimetre to the left, and about two centimetres down.  So that's the next turning point, just gradually ease your way to that point.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, and then we're going to go ... straight left, below the fallen pillars about ... close to a centimetre below the word {ci|fallen pillars} ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Parallel to there, to {fp|uh} just left of the word {ci|fallen} ... all right, left of the {le|f} and we'll stop there.<br>
==F: All right.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} ... {ph|tschew} ... Do you have anything below that?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} {ab|fall} {fp|uh} flamingoes is down and {fp|uh} ...<br>
==G: To the left?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, we're going to go around them.  Below them.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: So just ... I {ab|g} ...<br>
==F: Make a {le|u} underneath?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Just make a big {le|u} and stay about a half a centimetre away from them.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And then ...<br>
==F: {ab|Clear} ...<br>
==G: Come up until ... {fp|uh} ... {ab|y} ... Well, just make a little {le|u}, until you're straight across from where we are now.<br>
==F: Yeah.  That's where I am.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now we're going to ... You have ancient ruins or, what is it, just ...<br>
==F: Ruined city?<br>
==G: Ruined city, yeah.  Okay, same thing.  We're going to ease up to there and stay about a half a centimetre off to the left-hand side, and just ease up to the ancient ruins.<br>
==F: That's ruined city, right?<br>
==G: Ruined city, yeah, sorry.<br>
==F: All right ... I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay, what point are you at?  At the ruined city?<br>
==F: I'm at the very left-hand side approximately ...<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: halfway up the ruined city.<br>
==G: Okay.  You're going to ... See that dark ... the very dark shaded-in ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: section?  We got to go straight above that, about a centimetre.  So just stay half a centimetre away and go up about a centimetre above that.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay.  Do ... You don't have stones at the top of the page, do you?<br>
==F: I have rock fall?<br>
==G: Okay.  Or, wait, is that the mountain?<br>
==F: I have white mountain.<br>
==G: And to the {ab|le} ... straight above the the ruined city?<br>
==F: Straight above it I have nothing, but off to about one, one o'clock, two o'clock maybes, a rock fall.<br>
==G: Okay.  All right.  Looks like we're going to have to go ... {ab|ar} ... on top of that and to the right.  So we're going to go up about ... five centimetres straight up.<br>
==F: From where I am now?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: One two three four five.<br>
==G: And will you pass over top of the rock fall now?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} no, I'm just coming up to the bottom of it.<br>
==G: Okay, it's marked on mine {ci|stones}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay, so we're going to turn below them about a half a centimetre away and go straight, to ... over to the right about ... okay, about {ph|ffff} five centimetres.  To the ... And then we're going to be at the base of the mountain there?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, stay about a half a centimetre away from that, and ... go all the way round it to the other side.  Above it.<br>
==F: Of what?<br>
==G: The mountain.<br>
==F: Go ... So go around the left?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Go over top of the mountain.  Staying about a half a centimetre away.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And then when you get to the very bottom right-hand corner of of the the mountain ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: We're going to start to turn left again.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And I ... I have a thing called biggest furniture store.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Do you have gazelles?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, about five centimetres above that I have a big furniture store, {ab|bi} the {fp|uh} furniture store.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: So we have to stay about ... a centimetre and a half below the word {ci|white mountain}.  And you're going to turn to the left and go parallel to that.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  And you stop about ... half a centimetre left of the {ph|ber} very bottom left-hand corner of the mountain ... Just below that, like, that far to the left.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, and then go down about ten centimetres, straight down ... to the bottom of gazelles ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Turn to the right and stay about a half a centimetre below the word {ci|gazelles}.  And go for about another four centimetres, to the right ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Mark an {le|x}.  That's the finish.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: All right.  Right above the diamond mine ...<br>
==F: {ph|Aaayym=I'm} there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, on the west side ... just one centimetre away from the ... diamond mine, do a gentle arc all the way down until you're about a half a centimetre underneath the {le|d} in {ci|diamond}.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Move along to the east ... keeping half a centimetre under the writing of {ci|diamond mine} until you stop at the {le|e}. ... In {ci|mine}.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  To your east do you have a wagon wheel?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, I do not. I have a cactus.  And a rift valley.<br>
==G: All right.  Here's what I want you to do.  Go ... at a very ... gentle ... upward ... slope ...<br>
==F: From where I am?<br>
==G: From where you are.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Very gentle.  But I want you to go more east.  East about ... five centimetres, up one centimetre. {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ph|aye=are} you {ph|rat=at} ... Are you at the ...<br>
==F: Okay.  So I'm going up ... Okay.  From the diamond mine, I'm going up one centimetre and over five?<br>
==G: Yeah.  But you're going over five first and then up one.  So it's a very gentle ... slope ...<br>
==F: I don't ... I'm not getting that. I'm not understanding that part.<br>
==G: All right.  From the diamond mind ...<br>
==F: Yes.  I'm at the {le|e} ... in  {ci|diamond mine}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to go ... north ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Correction!  We're going to go east five centimetres.<br>
==F: From diamond mine?<br>
==G: From the diamond mine.<br>
==F: {ph|Sss} continuing the straight line?<br>
==G: Just go straight, east.<br>
==F: Okay.  One two three four five.  I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go ... north ... four centimetres ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you've got your cactus and your rift valley?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to do a gentle arc over top of the cactus ... and straight down the middle of rift valley.<br>
==F: Until I hit the {ci|cactus}, {ab|l} ... the {ab|r} ... the lettering?<br>
=-G: {fp|Er}, no, you go right over top of the cactus and you just stop right in the middle ... where it ... the sandy part of the rift valley is ...<br>
==F: Okay.  So I'm not going anywhere close to the ... cactus at all, then?<br>
=-G: No, you're going right over top of it.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm here.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, underneath the rift valley do you have two rocks?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, yes I do.<br>
==G: All right.  I want you to go straight down ... five centimetres ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: towards the large rock.<br>
==F: {ph|Ooookay=Okay}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a stony creek?<br>
==F: {ph|Nnnnnno=No} I do not.  But I have rapids.<br>
==G: But you do have a waterfall?<br>
==F: I have a rapids to my left.  Left of the rocks.<br>
==G: All right.  What ...<br>
==F: {ip|Bout=About} ten centimetres.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, take a look at the little rocks, or the rocks.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Go to the ... west of the rock.  You see a little tiny square?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Go right or {fp|er} ... left, two centimetres ...<br>
==F: Of that rock?<br>
==G: Of that little tiny square.<br>
==F: Left two centimetres.<br>
==G: Mark that point and draw a straight line from there ... all the way up to where ... I last left you.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: All right.  Now I want you to make a gentle, downward bow shape.  So with ... The bow is going to go ... bend towards the south.  It just goes down one centimetre ... and then it rises back up, and the bow has to be a total of four centimetres long. ... So you got that? You're doing a gentle downward bow ...<br>
==F: About four centimetres and then ... continuing up towards the rapids?<br>
==G: {ab|We} ... It's one centimetre down ...<br>
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.<br>
==G: but it goes along ... to the west, a total of four centimetres. So that you stop ... just to the ... east of the ... {fp|er} ... white water or in your case the rapids.<br>
==F: Okay, can you give me that one more time, please?<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: We're at {ab|th} ... I'm at the square of the rocks.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're at the square of the rocks?<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, can you see the white water or your rapids?<br>
==F: My rapids are on my left side, ten centimetres over ... from the rocks.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you ... to ... You got to {ab|g} go towards the rapids but you have to make a gentle ... bend ... You know what a happy face looks like?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Make a happy face from the ...<br>
==F: From the point I'm at ...<br>
==G: to ...<br>
==F: to the rapids, make a {ab|p} ... make a happy face?<br>
==G: to the upper part, northernmost ... point ... on the east side of the {ab|r} {fp|er} {ab|wh} ... rapids.<br>
==F: All right.  No problem then. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm there.<br>
==G: All right.  Do a gentle, upward arc around ... the ... rapids, going to the west ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: keeping a half centimetre away.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Do you have a ... item below the rapids?<br>
==F: I have a manned fort.  And that's all I have.<br>
==G: All right.  Here's what I want you to do.  Go ... south, in a gentle arc, and go all the way around ... the fort, at the bottom, and stop at the gate.<br>
==F: Left side of the fort?<br>
==G: Yes, you'd be on the left side of the fort.<br>
==F: Okay. ... Am I keeping half a centimetre distance from the fort?<br>
==G: Yeah.  That'd be good.<br>
==F: {ph|Aaaaaand=And} until I reach a {ab|le} ... the lettering?<br>
==G: {fp|Er}, the lettering or where the door is.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: All right. ... You have stone slabs to your east, but you ... And do you have a hideout ... also to the ... northeast?<br>
==F: Yes I do.  Outlaws' ...<br>
==G: It would ... might be a cave.<br>
==F: Yes I do. Outlies ... Outlaws' hideout and stone slabs.<br>
==G: All right.  Reference where I {ph|laft=last} ... last left you ...<br>
==F: Yes.<br>
==G: Draw ... a straight line to the {le|o} in the {ci|outlaw} ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: and stay about ...<br>
==F: So that's curving upwards?<br>
==G: It's curving upwards.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Stay about ... half a centimetre under the {ab|out} ... the {ab|w} writing.<br>
==F: I've reached the {le|o} in {ci|outlaws'}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}. Draw the line straight across until you hit the {le|t} ...<br>
==F: Okay, I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do a gentle, downward arc ... until you're about a half a centimetre away from the edge of the page ...<br>
==F: Downwards where?<br>
==G: So you're going east.<br>

==F: Am I keeping a distance?<br>
==G: Say again.<br>
==F: Am I keeping any distance?<br>
==G: {fp|Erm} ... keep about ... fairly close to the edge and about a {ab|ha} {fg|er} one centimetre away from the {fp|er} wood {ph|scaffling=scaffolding}.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: All right.  Do you have a {ab|s} a pond?<br>
==F: {fp|Er}, I have a stone creek.  To the left of my slabs, {fp|er} three centimetres down.<br>

==G: Yes.  You'd be over top of the writing.<br>
==F: Okay.  I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go ... straight west, for about a centimetre, and then you {ab|sh} {fp|er} ... directly in front of that should be your object, right?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: I have no objects there.<br>

==F: Okay then.<br>
==G: About two centimetres above it?<br>
==F: {ph|Nnno=No}.<br>
==G: The frown has to be a total of five centimetres ...<br>

==F: Done.<br>
==G: Okay, Marcus, your start.  Do you have the site of the forest fire?<br>

==G: Okay, don't worry about it, there's a second one.<br>
==F: Right.<br>
==G: What you want to do is ... Leave yourself half an inch and go underneath the waterfall and up the waterfall.  To the west.<br>
==F: All right, so {fp|uh} I can go straight between the granite quarry and the waterfall, right?<br>
==G: That's right, stay closer to the waterfall.<br>
==F: I'm up at the top of the waterfall.<br>
==G: Okay, leave yourself half an inch ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and ... You have something to the northeast of waterfall?<br>

==G: Okay, do you have the fallen ...<br>
==F: Yeah, I got it.<br>
==G: cairn?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Draw yourself a forty-five degree angle going southeast, straight underneath the fallen cairn ...<br>
==F: Okay, I'm underneath it right now and I'm heading ...<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to ... Do you have the limestone cliffs?<br>
==F: {ab|Ye} {fp|uh} ... No I don't.<br>

==F: Lion country. ... It's just {fp|uh} east of {fp|uh} east or it's just south of east lake.<br>
==G: Yeah, okay.  All right.  I guess that's the same thing then.<br>
==F: What is yours called?<br>
==G: Limestone cliffs.  Do you have cliffs there?<br>
==F: No I don't have cliffs.  Where are the cliffs again?<br>
==G: Okay, I think ... You see the ... eastmost south portion of the east lake?<br>

==F: No I don't have them.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: Am I going in between them?<br>
==G: Yeah, you're going in between, so stay closer to your ...<br>
==F: Got it.<br>
==G: {fp|uh} {ab|thi} ...<br>
==F: And where ... And whereabouts at the cornfield? ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm in between them now, I've done a doughnut and I ...<br>
==G: Okay, leave yourself half an inch, {ab|t} go straight up to east lake ...<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm at east lake now.<br>
==G: Okay.  You see the west ... the farthest westmost south tip?<br>
==F: Yeah.  I'm there.<br>
==G: Put one finger ... west ...<br>
==F: Yeah?<br>
==G: Draw an {le|x}.  We're done.<br>
==F: Done.  Let's go.<br>
==G: That's perfect.<br>
==G: Okay Mark, do you have {ph|thuuh=the} crest falls?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, go down to {le|c} ...<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, right or ... or east or west?<br>
==G: West side.<br>
==F: Okay, I'm there.<br>
==G: Do you see where ... Do you have baboons?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.<br>
==G: It's up a bit ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...<br>
==G: on the left side.<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.<br>
==G: You still don't?  Okay.  Take a full hand ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: {fp|uh} and {ph|gooo=go} directly west of crest falls.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, straight across?<br>
==G: Straight across.<br>
==F: Done.  I got a banana tree there.<br>
==G: Yeah, I figured you had something.  Do you have a footbridge?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Go up into the footbridge?<br>
==G: Yeah, go {ph|gnthg} go {fp|uh} ...<br>
==F: {ab|Alri} ...<br>
==G: go right to the end of it on the east side ...<br>
==F: The east side?<br>
==G: Yeah, go right over top ...<br>
==F: Okay, I don't go around the banana tree?<br>
==G: Yeah, go right around it.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, to the west though, right?<br>
==G: To the west, that's right.<br>
==F: Right, and then I go over to the east?  Yeah, I'm at the {ab|footbri} ...<br>
==G: Yeah, across the footbridge.  Do you have the poisoned stream?<br>
==F: {fp|Uh} no.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do is, is as soon as you get to the ... end of the footbridge, come two fingers directly south ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Do you have the old temple?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, {ab|g} {fp|uh} go right to the west side of the old temple and go up ...<br>
==F: Now, I go south two fingers first?<br>
==G: Yeah, go south two fingers to avoid the poisoned stream.<br>
==F: Yeah, and then I go where?<br>
==G: Go across ... to the old temple.  Leave yourself half an inch on the west side.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Okay?  Do you have the abandoned truck?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... go directly north on the west side of the old temple ... Go one finger north ... of the abandoned truck ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I've a got a mountain there.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do is go over top of that mountain and {ab|undernea} ...<br>
==F: And get over to the truck?<br>
==G: and underneath the truck.<br>
==F: Over and under ... All right, I'm under the ... and I'm over ... I'm at ... the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned}.<br>
==G: Okay, perfect.  What you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ... half a finger west ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: you need to come down another ... three fingers, underneath ... what I have as baboons.<br>
==F: Okay, and that'll take me just about to where I run into the line for the footbridge, right?<br>
==G: Yeah, almost.  Maybe a finger?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do then is ... {fp|Uh}, you have white mountain?<br>
==F: Yeah.  And go up the side of white mountain?<br>
==G: Okay ...<br>
==F: The west side?<br>
==G: Yeah, leave yourself enough room to get around the baboons.<br>
==F: Got her.<br>
==G: Go up ... Go ...<br>
==F: I'm at the top of the mountain, Dave.<br>
==G: Okay, go directly {fp|uh} ... Do you see where the pyramid is?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Go as far north as the base of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: {ab|S} ... {fg|Eh} keep going up the side of the mountain?<br>
==G: Yeah, but go straight north once you hit the peak, and ...<br>
==F: Straight north!  I'll run into {ab|s} a lemon grove.<br>
==G: Okay, go around the lemon grove ... {ab|g} to the west side.<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm around the lemon grove now.<br>
==G: Okay, go around the pyramid, up on top, and to the east.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have a ... You don't have a cobbled street, do you?<br>
==F: No, I got a poisoned stream though.<br>
==G: Okay, what you're doing is, go right underneath the pyramid, to the edge of the pyramid ...<br>
==F: To the west edge, right?<br>
==G: That's right.  Do you have the remote village?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} follow a soft line, {ph|dlike=like} go one finger west of the pyramid, and ...<br>
==F: Yeah, I'm there now.<br>
==G: Okay, and go directly south, underneath the remote village ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Leave yourself half an inch ...<br>
==F: Okay, I'm there now.<br>
==G: Okay, one finger ... east of the {le|e} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: right at the same height as the letter {le|n} in {ci|mountain} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: draw yourself an {le|x}, that's the finish.<br>
==F: Done.<br>
==G: Okay, you have your start point and you have ... a, like, a forest fire ... underneath it?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, go out a {ab|cen} ... like ... a centimetre to the left so you're like a half a centimetre down the left-hand side of the forest fire. Go down about ten centimetres ...<br>
==F: Parallel with farmyard?<br>
==G: Yeah, you want to be {ab|r} straight across from the bottom of farmyard.<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: Okay.  And then you want to go ... bend to the right about four centimetres ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: And now you're going to go up the left-hand side of the adventure playground.<br>
==F: The left-hand side?<br>
==G: Yeah.  So you got to kind of curve back ...<br>
==F: All right.<br>
==G: And then ... Okay.  From the top of the adventure playground ... You have something underneath your granite quarry, don't you?<br>
==F: Yeah, privately owned fields.<br>
==G: Okay, we're going to go below that.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so you're going to angle up to the corner and then head straight up the page and circle above the granite quarry.<br>
==F: {fp|Uh}, going around the right or around the left?<br>
==G: Around the right.<br>
==F: All right.  I'm there.<br>
==G: So you're going to go out to the right about, what's that, ten centimetres or so?  To the ... To the right-hand edge of that ... {ph|hoo} whatever it is that's there.<br>
==F: Okay, I came around the adventure playground on the left?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Over ...<br>
==F: under privately owned fields?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: Hooked north?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: went up over top of the granite quarry?<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==F: And I'm now sitting at the {le|g}.<br>
==G: Okay, good.  Good.  Exactly.  Okay {fp|um} ... You don't have a ... Do you have a fence or anything underneath the waterfall?<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay, there's a fence about three centimetres below the word {ci|waterfall}. That runs straight across.<br>
==F: All right.  How big is it?<br>
<a name="72">-2G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three centimetres straight across.<br>
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?<br>
<b>-0G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.<br>
</b>+1F: Okay.<br>
+2G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an angle ... and then go straight across ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm right between them now.<br>
==G: Okay.  {br|U under=under} the waterfall, like, under the word {ci|waterfall} ...<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: and curve up the left-hand side, follow it all the way up, and then ... See that very sharp peak?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: On the {br|l eft=left} hand side?  You just want to come above that to the right about a centimetre.  Go straight up {ab|unti} {ip|til=until} you're about a centimetre above it and then turn to the right.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, stop there.  Then go another two centimetres ...<br>
==F: On that ...<br>
==G: So {ab|y} ... you're ... you should be straight above the right-hand edge of the waterfall.<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now you want to go north two more centimetres, straight north two centimetres.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: And now, do you have any obstacles around here?<br>
==F: Yeah.  Public {fp|uh} {ph|tootpath=footpath} or something.  It's, like, about an inch to my right.<br>
==G: Yeah, that's good.  Okay, we're going to go ... above that and then down to the right, and circle under the fallen cairn, on the right-hand edge of the paper?<br>
==F: All right, I'm under it.<br>
==G: Okay, you just make a big loop and come underneath the fallen cairn.<br>
==F: I'm under it.<br>
==G: Okay, do you have limestone cliffs or, like, limestone or ...?<br>
==F: No.  I have an east lake.<br>
==G: It's {ab|bet} ... It's between fallen cairn and east lake on the right-hand edge of the paper.<br>
==F: No.<br>
==G: Okay.  {fp|Um} ... this is the tricky part, right here.  Underneath fallen cairn, when you circle back up ... {ab|y} ... you have to come back to the left ... but {fp|uh} ... Okay, I'm going to give you a point.  See the {le|e} in fallen cairn?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Five centimetres straight above that ... You you come around fallen cairn and then you loop back up to that point.<br>
==F: All right, I'm there.<br>
==G: Okay.  Now go {ab|s} ...<br>
==F: I'm right at the very right-hand side of lion country.<br>
==G: Okay, I don't have that on mine.<br>
==F: Okay, does ...<br>
==G: {ab|Li} ...<br>
==F: From that point, does your line hook low or does it go high?<br>
==G: It goes straight up.<br>
==F: All right, heading for east lake?<br>
==G: Yeah.  Until you're about a half a centimetre away again.<br>
==F: All right, I'm there.<br>
==G: And then follow it ... Okay, see the very bottom left-hand corner?<br>
==F: Yeah.<br>
==G: Okay, we're going to follow it around but instead of ... when we get to that point, just keep going straight towards the cornfields for about another centimetre.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Mark the {le|x}.  That's the finish.<br>
==F: That's it.  Done.<br>
==G: Yeah.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're right above a falls?<br>
==F: Yes, I am.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go ... two centimetres ... west ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: And then three centimetres down.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: Now.  Directly west of your falls you probably have two objects? ... Do you?<br>
==F: I have banana tree to the very left and that's all I have.<br>
==G: Very {ph|ferry=very} left.  All right, I want you to go ... {fp|um} {ab|s} ... even with the crescent falls to the west, it's about fifteen centimetres {ab|w} left, so you would pass your obstacle ... and then you would arc up to the north.<br>
==F: Around my banana tree?<br>
==G: Do you have a ... Say again.<br>
==F: Around the banana tree?<br>
==G: Around the banana tree.  Do you have some {ph|bidi} {fp|uh} baboons above your {ph|bananha=banana} tree?<br>
==F: I do not.<br>
==G: Okay.<br>
==F: I have nothing above my banana tree.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, just up about ... six centimetres.<br>
==F: {fp|Ah}, okay, I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a footbridge?<br>
==F: Yes, I do.<br>
==G: I want you to go from where I left you ... arc across the footbridge and as soon as you cross ...<br>
==F: Across?  On it?  Over?<br>
==G: Yeah, like on it.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: Soon as you get to the other side stop.  Do you have an {fp|uh} a a poison stream ... directly east of the footbridge?<br>
==F: No, I don't but I have an old temple to the right.<br>
==G: Okay.  What we're going to do is you're going to go straight south two ... and a half centimetres ...<br>
==F: From my footbridge?<br>
==G: From your footbridge.<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  South two centimetres.<br>
==G: Then you're going to go ... east ... about ... five centimetres ...<br>
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, and then you have your temple ...<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: What you're going to do is you're going to go up ... the western side of the temple ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Up to the peak.  Now do you have a mountain just slightly to the ...<br>
==F: {ab|S} ... Yes, I do.<br>
==G: Go up, over top of the mountain on the western {ab|si} ... {br|a all=all} the way around and then when you get to the western side stop.  So you're going up on the east side ...<br>
==F: To the peak?<br>
==G: Up to the peak.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have an {ph|anbandoned=abandoned} truck?<br>
==F: Yes I do.<br>
==G: Go down ... along the mountain and stop under the {le|k} of the {fp|uh} ... {ci|truck}.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Proceed to the {le|a} ...<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
==G: in {ci|abandoned}.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: All right.  From the {le|a} you're going to go south ... three centimetres ...<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you're going to go west three centimetres.<br>
==F: Okay.<br>
==G: Then you're going to go north three centimetres.<br>
==F: I'm there.<br>
