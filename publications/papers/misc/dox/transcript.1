==G: Can we go, Steve?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Uh}, we're starting from above the missionary camp.
==F: Yeah.  Got it.
==G: Do you have that?  Okay, what I want you to do is proceed ... west, to the {ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} northwest corner of the missionary camp.
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have anything right beside the missionary camp?
==F: I have a banana tree off to the far west.
==G: Off to the far west?  How far?  Is it right beside the missionary camp or there's a gap?
==F: It's {ip|bout=about} {fp|uh} ... two ... two fingers from half page, west.
==G: Okay.  Okay what I want you to do is go along ... south, down past the missionary camp ...
==F: All right.
==G: {ab|S} So you're even with it, though.
==F: All right.
==G: And proceed to the bottom of that ... I believe you have a banana bush.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Or whatever.
==F: A {ab|bana} ...
==G: I've got gorillas.  Do you have gorillas?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  I I think gorillas and banana bush are sharing the same thing here.  So proceed west to that ...
==F: All right.
==G: to the far southwest corner ...
==F: All right.
==G: of your bananas ...
==F: All right.
==G: And what I want you to do is ... now proceed north ...
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have a rope bridge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, what I want you to do is curve up above, to the {fp|uh} west side of the rope bridge ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Now join to the other side of the rope bridge now, the east part.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have anything beside that?
==F: {fp|Uh}, I have a waterfall to the far, far east.
==G: Okay.  I want you to ... just go down a bit, go {fp|uh} ... south, down past the the rope bridge, once you get off it ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ab|ju} just about one finger width.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  And then proceed to the bottom ... the {fp|uh} southwest tip of the waterfall ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Above the waterfall, on the west side, do you have some lost steps?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Do you have anything there?
==F: I don't have anything.
==G: Okay.
==F: No.
==G: What I want you to do is, start moving north ...
==F: All right.
==G: up the waterfall, up the west side of the waterfall ...
==F: All right.
==G: about ... one finger length.  Do you have any fallen pillars?
==F: {fp|Uh} off to the {ab|f} west, I do.
==G: {ab|A} Above the {ab|n} ... the {fp|uh} rope bridge, more or less?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  I want you to head for the northernmost {fp|uh} ... northeastern tip of the fallen pillars ...
==F: All right.
==G: and then go below them.  And end up at the ... southwest tip.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything ... {ab|l} let's see {fp|uh}, southwest of that?
==F: {ab|Y} ...
==G: Of the fallen pillars?
==F: Yes I do, I have {fp|uh} flamingoes.
==G: Okay, I don't have any flamingoes, so what I want you to do is curl around the ... {fp|um} ... southeastern tip of the flamingoes ...
==F: All right.
==G: and come up to the ... northwestern side.
==F: All right.  I'm there.
==G: Okay?  So you've gone almost all the way around them.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, do you have any ancient ruins above that?
==F: I have a ruined city.
==G: Ruined city?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {fp|Uh}, is that about one quarter down the page?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, I want you to head for the ... {fp|um} ... let's see, northwestern tip of that ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  And stop there.  Now, do you have any stones up above that?
==F: I have a rock fall off to the {fp|uh} ... north ... north northeast ... of it.
==G: To the north northeast?
==F: Yeah.  Approximately half a finger.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Um}, what I want you to do is from the ancient ruins, just head straight north.
==F: All right.
==G: {ip|Til=Until} you're about {ab|th} ... half a finger down from the top of the page.  Do you now have a white mountain off to the east?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Head for the north {ab|w} ... {fp|um} sorry, the southwest tip of that mountain ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Now proceed over top of the mountain and down to the ... {fp|um} southeast side ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Below this mountain, do you have the biggest furniture store?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is go right under the mountain to just right below it and head west ...
==F: All right.
==G: under the mountain ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You're ... You're going to pass in between the mountain and my biggest furniture store ...
==F: All right.
==G: And stop at the ... {ab|n} ... where you started touching the mountain but dropped a bit.
==F: {gg|Oh}, all right.
==G: Okay?  {fp|Um}, do you have any gazelles?
==F: {fp|Uh}, right to the {ab|d} south, I do.
==G: To the south?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Yeah.  Head south to the gazelles ...
==F: All right.
==G: To the {fp|um} southwestern point of the gazelles ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then turn east ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Go about half a finger east of the gazelles ...
==F: All right.
==G: And that's our finish point.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?
==G: Start!  Northwest of the diamond mine ... You've got the start marked, I guess?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You proceed ... southwest one finger, then southerly about three and a half fingers, and pass eastward, on the southern border of the diamond mine.
==F: Okay, I don't ... okay, so eastward you want to go?
==G: {gg|Oh}, do you have the diamond mine?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {gg|Oh}, okay.
==F: Okay, from the start point you want me to go where? Come {ph|chmm} south?
==G: Yes.
==F: Southwest, right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ab|O}
==G: Well you're really just doing a loop around the diamond mine ...
==F: Okay.  Okay.
==G: counter-clockwise. And you come off near the {le|e} of the word {ci|diamond mine}, heading east northeast towards ... the rift valley.
==F: Okay, where do you want me to stop there?
==G: Well, you better stop about half way towards the word {ci|rift}.  Have you got the wagon wheel marked in there?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  On your ... north side as you're heading towards the rift valley, about half way from the word {ci|diamond mine} to the middle of the rift valley ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: there's a small wagon wheel on your north side.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed ... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading northerly or {ab|eith} even slightly west of north, going up the east side of that wagon wheel.
==F: Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?
==G: No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...
==F: You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...
==G: Towards ...
==F: middle of the {ab|ri} ...
==G: Half way towards the rift valley.
==F: {gg|Oh}, okay, half way.  All right.
==G: Yeah, the wagon wheel's half way, and you just ... make a left turn around the far side or the east side of that wagon wheel.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you're passing ... on the south side of this wagon wheel, and you curve ... counter-clockwise to your left, as you go past it, so you're actually heading north {ab|a} after you've passed the east side of the wagon wheel.  It's just a big {le|s} you're doing.  And then, after you're about a finger north of the wagon wheel, you cut back to the right or the northeast, and then you go over the top of the rift valley and right down the middle ...
==F: Okay.
==G: of the rift valley heading south southwards right down the middle of the rift valley.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you go above it and then it's just like you're going for a swim in a pool.
==F: So I I'm on the east side of the cactus now?
==G: {fg|Er}, I don't have a cactus marked, but probably the cactus is, what, southwest of the rift valley?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Yeah, just ignore the cactus.  You're going due south from the very centre of the rift valley ...
==F: Okay.
==G: about four fingers
==F: Okay.
==G: So you probably miss the cactus.  Then, after going about ... Have you got rocks?  South of the rift valley?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  About ...
==F: I'm right above them, right now.
==G: Yeah, okay, well sixty per cent of the way from the rift valley to the rocks, you change your course and start heading ... southwest.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you miss the rocks by about one finger.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you then can proceed about four fingers past the rocks, so that you're now {ab|w} ... {ab|s} west southwest of the rocks about three or four fingers.  On your north side there should be a stone creek.
==F: No.  Don't have it.
==G: No stone creek.  Well it's there, and what you do ...
==F: {gg|Oh} Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!
==G: {gg|Oh}.
==F: It's {fp|er} ... south west from the rocks, way down.
==G: {gg|Oh} {ab|tha} that'll be a different one.  Yeah, {gg|oh} that's away down.  That's a different stone creek.
==F: Yeah.
==G: There's one stone creek ... due west of the rocks about four fingers.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|An} {ab|An} And after heading south from the rift valley and then heading southwesterly, you pass ... south of this stone creek which is four fingers due west of the rocks ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And then you ... curve to your right or to ... the north ... west northwest, let's say.  Do you have the white water ... marked?
==F: I just have rapids.
==G: Rapids.  It's probably the same.
==F: {gg|Mmm}.
==G: And this is about five or six fingers south of the diamond mine?
==F: Diamond mines? Yeah.
==G: Okay.  You pass ... {ab|ac} above the north side of {ab|tha} those rapids.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you're heading ... west northwest at the time.  Do you have a swamp marked?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Well, you're heading toward the swamp, but you don't go anyplace near the swamp, you cut a sharp left, heading south west and then south, around that white water, so you're actually passing counter-clockwise around the white water or the rapids.
==F: Okay.  So am I going to go east, again?
==G: No ...
==F: Past ... No?
==G: you're then going to go south.
==F: Okay.
==G: After passing the rapids you head south about five or six fingers.
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then you ...
==F: I should be right beside a manned fort.
==G: You know I don't have the manned fort, but what I think you'll be doing is passing west of the fort as you're heading southerly.
==F: Okay.
==G: And ... Do you have the stone slabs marked?
==F: Yeah.  They're {fp|uh} ...
==G: Northeast of the stone creek?  The lower stone creek?
==F: They're south ... Yeah!  {ab|Th} That's right.
==G: And they're southwest of the outlaws' hideout?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Well, heading toward the stone creek, the lower stone creek, you curve to the east northeast, towards the outlaws' hideout.  So you've ...
==F: So I should be going around the manned fort, then?
==G: Yes, you're probably going around the manned fort.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you head right up to the south side of the outlaws' hideout and you hang a right and you curve southwards then ...
==F: Okay.
==G: having missed the south side of the outlaws' hideout by about a half finger.
==F: So I ... I'm coming down to a gold mine.
==G: Yeah, you're probably going around the gold mine, then ... {ip|cause=because} you head straight down the right-hand side of the page, and around the noose, you're passing to the east of the noose.
==F: Okay.
==G: You then ... curve ... to the south west after you pass the east side of the noose.
==F: Okay.
==G: And go about three fingers.  And then, dead ahead of you is a little swan pond, which is about one finger high and three fingers wide.
==F: I don't have that, I have a a saloon bar?
==G: You'll get there later.
==F: Okay.
==G: It's about half way from the noose to the saloon bar.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then you skirt the swan pond on the north side by dipping up about half ... about one finger, then west about three fingers, and then southwest about one finger.  So you just bypass this swan pond.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then you continue on to the south side of the saloon bar.
==F: South side, okay.
==G: And then you just have a slow arc {fp|uh} that takes you past the saloon bar and up to the northeast, about three and a half fingers, where you finish.
==F: So I should be coming ... down? Okay, okay.
==G: {fg|Uh}, what you're doing is a big circle.  The centre of the circle is the stone creek, and the the course you're following takes you past the saloon bar on the south side, so it's just a big arc from the swan pond, below the saloon bar and then up to the northwest to your finish.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you're about three inches from the ... southwest corner of the saloon bar when you finish.  And you're heading northwest or or north northwest at that point.
==F: Okay.
==G: That's it.
==F: Done!
==G: Okay, Richard.  We're going to start off.  Do you have an east lake in the ... northeast corner?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Of your map?  Right.  There's the ... Do you see the ... ... the northwest point of {ab|th} east lake?
==F: Northwest point of east lake?
==G: Yeah.  The highest northwest point.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then directly below that is the ... southwest corner ... of east lake?
==F: Straight down?  The southwest?  Yeah.
==G: Yeah.  Okay, well just ... just a little {br|pa ast=past} a a little west of that corner is your {ab|f} ... {fg|Oh}, well, that'll be your finish {fg|eh}? I'm looking at the wrong spot!  Okay. Do you have a ... train crossing at the ... {br|north west=northwest} corner of your page?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Well, if you go directly south, {ph|fffar=far} down south, do you have a {ph|ssssite=site} of ... {ph|ffforest=forest} fire?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Right above, in the centre of the {ab|s} ... site of forest fire ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I got the start.
==G: Okay ... {gg|Oh}!  All right. ... Okay, so now you're going to go ... to the left-hand side ... of the forest fire site ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: and go ... straight down south.
==F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?
==G: No.  No.  Go west.
==F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.
==G: Yeah.
==F: And then straight south?
==G: Straight south.  Do you have a picnic site?  South of the site of the forest fire?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, then.  On the far right corner of your page do you have a farm ground?  Farmyard, sorry.
==F: Yeah.  On the far right, bottom right.
==G: Okay.  So then, at the bottom ... Okay.  As you've {ab|go} ... You've gone straight down south from the forest fire site?
==F: Yeah, but I'm on basically the southwest corner of the forest fire.
==G: Okay.  Go ... Keep going straight down {ip|til=until} {ab|yo} ...
==F: Keep ... Straight down?  How far?
==G: until your line's {ph|beloooow=below} the farmyard ... just in line with that.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay? ... Then go ... Do you have an adventure playground?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Well, go ... straight ... east ...
==F: Straight east?
==G: towards {ab|far} ... the farmyard ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then go straight up {ab|n} north ...
==F: When do I head north?
==G: {ph|Buz} So that you'll come up along the west side of the adventure playground.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  The the west side, okay.
==G: Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit {br|north east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: until you come to in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your stopping point would be {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south} west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You see that, way up there?  But you're still {ab|s} ...
==F: So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?
==G: No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line with the southeast corner ...
==F: So I go ...
==G: southwest corner, sorry, of east lake.
==F: Okay.  So I ... you want me to go {ab|nor} ... northeast, when I hit the adventure playground, the northwest corner?  Go northeast until I hit the southwest corner?
==G: Okay.  You've gone straight up ... the west side of the adventure playground ...
==F: Yeah.  And then start curving northeast?
==G: Now {ab|s} ... Yes.
==F: Okay.  And then ...
==G: Until you're in line ... with the ... southwest corner of east lake. Just so that you're in line.  Don't go up or anything.  {ab|J} ...
==F: Okay.  So basically, east lake ... {ab|w} I'll stop at this point {fp|er} east lake, that southwest corner'll be north of me?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Directly north of you.  Right.  Okay, now you're going to go straight up. Do you have a {ab|d} {fp|er} granite quarry?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  You're going to come up ... go all the way up and curve over the top of the granite quarry ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Curve over the top of the granite quarry.
==G: {ab|c} ... And then, to the left of that do you have a train crossing?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Then curve down ...
==F: I've got ... I've got a train crossing though, like, the top {ab|we} ... the northwest.
==G: Okay, yeah.  Don't worry about that one.
==F: Okay.  Another one.
==G: I have two then.  Okay, then you're going to come ... curve over the top of the granite quarry ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And go ... south southeast ... travelling direction, so ...
==F: South southeast?
==G: Yeah.
==F: South southeast?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you want me to curve around?
==G: Yeah, over top and then you'll be travelling south southeast.  Do you have a waterfall?
==F: Yeah, I have a waterfall.  That's west ... {ab|di} just a little bit north and west of granite quarry.
==G: Yeah, okay.  And then curve up underneath the waterfall ...
==F: So, how far south ... Okay, after I curve ...
==G: {gg|Oh} just so that you're in line, sorry, just so that you're in line with the word {ci|granite quarry}.
==F: Okay.  So just go ... just basically {br|south east=southeast} until I hit the granite quarry.  Okay.  And then from there?
==G: {ph|Wa} No, no.  You you've gone up over top of the granite quarry, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Then come down ... southeast, yeah?
==F: Okay.
==G: so you're in line with the word {ci|granite quarry} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Then curve up under the waterfall.  Go straight up the ... west side of the waterfall.  The rock there in the waterfall.
==F: So, I go under the word {ci|waterfall} and then {ab|g} off the {ab|we} ...
==G: Yes.
==F: curve on the west side?  Okay.
==G: Then straight up across the top of the waterfall ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Across the top.
==G: And then from the ... the farthest ... point of waterfall that you can see, make a curve up ... so that you come in line ... Do you have cornfields north of that?
==F: I've got cornfields northeast.
==G: Well, yeah, okay.  But so ... when you come across the top of the waterfall ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: curve north ...
==F: Curve north?
==G: so that you're going straight up in line with the cornfields.  The edge of the ... the west edge of the cornfields.
==F: Okay.  So I go up the west edge, of cornfields.
==G: Right.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a limestone cliffs way off to the {ab|we} ... the east, sorry?
==F: No.
==G: No.  Okay. Let me see then. Okay.  You see the ... the southeast corner of east lake?
==F: Southeast corner?  Yeah.
==G: Yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ip|cause=because} you've stopped probably by now ... at the ... Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... You've come up straight towards the cornfields?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Okay.  Halfway between the waterfall and the cornfields you stop, okay?
==F: Okay.  Halfway only.  Okay.
==G: Okay?  And then you go ... Start curving right ...
==F: Curve right.  Okay.
==G: and head ... {fp|er} south southeast.
==F: South southeast?
==G: And then do you ... do you see {ph|aaaaa=a} a fallen ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how far do I curve right?  How far do I go right?
==G: Just a little curve right.
==F: Okay.
==G: Not far {ph|ss} ... The curve should ... be in a little arc, within the word {ci|cornfields}.  That's north of you.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Then do you have a ... fallen {ab|cair} ... cairn there? To the {ab|sou} ...?
==F: Yeah.  I got a fallen cairn.
==G: Yeah, okay.  Follow that all the way ... Come all the way down there then ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and curve up all the way around so you're coming up the {fp|er} ...
==F: So ...
==G: east side of it ...
==F: So I curve under the fallen cairn and then on the east side? Okay.
==G: Yeah.  Yes.  So that you're coming all the way up the other side.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then do you have limestone cliffs just ...?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Okay, you see the {le|k} in {ci|east lake}?
==F: Okay, yeah.
==G: Okay.  You're going to curve over top of the fallen cairn ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then you're going to come straight up towards the {le|k} in {ci|east lake} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Follow the east lake along the {ab|w} ... the shoreline there ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  {ph|Ss} the south shoreline, right?
==G: Yes.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Just past the far ... the {ab|f} ... the ... the farthest ... southeast corner there ... is your finish line.
==F: Okay.
==G: Just past there.  Is your finish.  That's it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Right.
==G: Okay, {ab|Rich} Richard, do you have a remote village right ... in the {br|nor thern=northern} part of your sheet?  Almost in the centre?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I've got {fp|uh} remote village below the pyramid.
==G: Below the pyramid, yeah.  The the top pyramid?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.
==F: Okay.
==G: You see that remote village?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Right, okay, well then, doesn't matter.  That's where we'll finish.  Right. Do you have {fp|uh} ... crest falls at the bottom of your page?
==F: Yeah, I've got the start.
==G: Okay.  Right there, then.  Okay, start there ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: and curve around the west side ...
==F: The west ...
==G: so that you're ... you're going south ... Go west for ... at crest falls and go down along the side of crest falls to the south ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and curve so that you're going ... in line with the word {ci|crest falls}?  Go straight west.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how far?
==G: Keep going until ... Do you have {ab|balloo} ... {gg|Oh}, or, sorry, baboons?  In {ab|th} ... north ...
==F: No.
==G: on the {br|north west=northwest} part of your sheet?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, do you have {fp|uh} ... white mountain?
==F: I've got ...
==G: Way up north on your sheet?
==F: I've got ... Yeah I've got a white mountain right next to the remote village.
==G: {fg|Oh}, okay, right.  Well ... from that that line going straight from crest falls ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to curve a line up ... so that you're heading in the direction of the {le|w} in {ci|white mountain}.  Past the {le|w}, actually, in {ci|white mountain}.  Almost the edge, of the west side of white mountain.
==F: Okay, so from the crest falls ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: I go ... Basically, from the start, I go ... west, then go on the west side, go south?
==G: Right.
==F: {ip|Til=Until} I'm in line with the word {ci|crest falls}?
==G: Right.
==F: Then go west.  How far do I go west?
==G: Keep going west until you're at the ... edge of white mountain.  You see where the edge of the bottom of it is?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ab|th} ... Just the edge of the mountain itself?  Okay.
==G: Yeah.  Okay, and then curve up and make like a circle.  Do you have a footbridge?
==F: I've got a footbridge which is northwest of crest falls.
==G: That's right.  Okay, you're going to come up and circle around and cross over that footbridge.
==F: Okay, so basically I go west and I go ... curve towards the white mountain?
==G: Curve north.  Curve north ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and then you're curving back east over the footbridge.
==F: Do I go {ab|d} over it or {ab|un} ... Over the top?
==G: Over it, right over it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, and then right as you ... soon as you get off the footbridge ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: go ... Do you have a poison stream there?
==F: {fp|Uh}, I've got a poison stream which is northwest ... northeast of the remote village.
==G: Okay, don't worry about that, then.  I have one of those too.  Okay, as soon as you get off the footbridge, then, right at the edge of the footbridge, head south ...
==F: Right at the edge, okay.  So head south at the east edge?
==G: Yeah, and then ... to between ... Do you have a ... where it says {ci|start}?  Just {fp|uh} a little bit up from there, go ... You know where it says {ci|start}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, take your south line ... Do you have an old temple?
==F: Yeah, I got an old temple.
==G: Okay, well, take your ... your line south off the footbridge, then.
==F: Okay, so ... Hang on!  I go on the footbridge ...
==G: Right.
==F: and then on the east side I go south?
==G: Yes.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how far south?
==G: Right south, right away.
==F: How far south, though?
==G: Halfway between ... the word {ci|footbridge} and {ci|start}.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay, and then curve up so that you come up along the west side of old temple ...
==F: So {ph|basicalleee=basically}, curve up?
==G: Yeah, curving up ...
==F: So you {ab|wa} ...
==G: right up ...
==F: Go east and then curve up over the ... old temple, you mean?
==G: Right.  On the west side of it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  And then you're going to come up in a {ph|biiig=big} arcing circle, going north ... so that you're ... {gg|Oh}, how do I say that? Do you have an abandoned truck?
==F: I have an abandoned truck which is south of white mountain?
==G: West ... {ab|I} It's north ... It would be north of the footbridge?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, well, as you come up the west side of the old temple ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: make a big arc so that you're half the distance between the abandoned truck and your remote village ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, half the distance between the abandoned truck and remote village?
==G: Right.
==F: Arc there, okay.
==G: Okay?  So ... And then circle down and head southwest so that you come straight under the abandoned truck.
==F: Okay.  {fp|Uh} ... so ...
==G: Then when you get to the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned} ...
==F: {fp|Uh-huh}.
==G: curve south ...
==F: Okay, so curve {ab|s} ... Okay, so basically, I curve ...
==G: Curve south.  {ab|Ju} ... Go south.
==F: Curve and then go around the bottom?  Of ... abandoned truck?
==G: In the {le|a} ... From the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned truck}, go south.
==F: Go south.  Straight south?
==G: Yeah.  Just go straight south.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: How far?
==G: You're going to go as far as ... Count the rings on the temple, there's one, two, three, four, five, six ... I have seven rings, right to the top ...
==F: One.  Two, three, four, five, six, seven {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and you're going to go west at about the second ring ... from the bottom.
==F: From the top or the bottom?
==G: Pardon me?
==F: From the top?
==G: From the bottom of the old temple.
==F: Okay, so the second from the bottom.
==G: That's the height level, yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ip|cause=because} you have to go around baboons, I have baboons.
==F: So I go south of abandoned truck from the {ab|cor} ... the southwest corner of abandoned truck?
==G: Yeah.  From the word ...
==F: And then go west?  At the second ring of the temple.
==G: Yeah, and head west.
==F: Okay, how far?
==G: Do you have anything else {fp|uh} ...
==F: I've got nothing west of abandoned truck.
==G: Okay, then, make a curve ... farther out than the {ab|o} ... the first big curve you made ...
==F: Okay, then ... The the first one, basically, after crest falls, you mean?
==G: Yeah, that big curve you made first?
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, and then ...
==F: Further out?  How high, though?
==G: {fg|Oh}, not ... not high.  Just ... Make the curve about the same size as the abandoned truck, actually.
==F: So, okay, so basically half ...
==G: From the old temple, from the second ring, you're going to make a curve the size of the abandoned truck ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: so that you're going west and then you're going to go north ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: towards white mountain ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Come all the {ab|w} ... Come all the way up north along the west face of white mountain.
==F: Okay, so you want me to curve around it and then go ... Do I go ... curve towards the white mountain?
==G: Yeah.  You made a big curve and then you're going to go on an angle of probably ... {ab|north} northeast ...
==F: Northeast, okay.
==G: towards ... Go up the face of white mountain, the west side.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, how {ab|fa} ... Okay yeah, I go up the face of the west side?
==G: Okay, and then go ... As you're going up the {ab|w} ... the west face, go straight up ... Do you have a pyramid at the top of your page?
==F: I've got a pyramid at the {ab|to} ... the {br|north east=northeast} {ab|cor} ...
==G: Okay, well, go ... Keep going north from the tip of white mountain, go straight north ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: until you're in line with the bottom of the pyramid, and then head east ... Right?
==F: Okay.
==G: Curve up all the way up and around right down underneath the bottom of the pyramid ...
==F: So I curve ... {ab|bel} ...
==G: Curve all the way around the pyramid, go right around it ...
==F: Below?
==G: like you're making a pyramid yourself.
==F: Okay, below the pyramid or above it?
==G: Right up above it ...
==F: Okay, above it.
==G: down the east side and across the bottom.
==F: Okay.
==G: So that you're heading west again.
==F: All right.  Got it.
==G: Right then, do you have a ... cobbled street?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, well then, at the {ab|b} ... southwest corner of the pyramid ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: go south ...
==F: Go south, okay.
==G: come ... curve around the bottom of the remote village ...
==F: Curve around the bottom?  Or ...
==G: Yeah.  Come all the way down south and curve around the bottom of the remote village ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and just past the remote village, you finish.
==F: Okay, so I'm going to curve ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, so, basically, come down on the west side of remote village and go east?
==G: Right.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I go east and {br|h how=how} far?
==G: Just past it, make and {le|x}.
==F: Just past, okay.
==G: and you have your finish.  Okay?
==F: Got it.
==G: That's it.
==G: Are you ready, steve?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, our starting point is at the site of the forest fire.
==F: Yeah, got it.
==G: Okay.  What you're going to do is you're going to move to the west side of the forest fire.
==F: All right.
==G: And start moving south.  Down.  Do you have a picnic site just below the forest fire?
==F: I have a ... No I don't.  I have an adventure playground, right to the {fp|uh} ... {ab|s} ...
==G: Okay, okay.  Have that too.
==F: {gg|Oh}.
==G: Right below the forest fire, I have a picnic site.  So what you're going to do is you're going to head, {fp|uh} sorry, south, down ... around the west side of my picnic site ... and start east and then come up between that and the adventure playground.  So I want you to end up on the ... northwest corner of the adventure playground.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I go on the east side of ... or I go on the west side of the forest fire?
==G: Yeah.
==F: All right.
==G: Straight down.  Imagine that there is a picnic site just below there.
==F: Yeah, all right.
==G: Okay?  {ab|S} So you're going to go around that.  And you're going to end up at the {fp|uh} ... {ab|n} northwest corner of the playground.
==F: All right, I'm there.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... for ... two finger lengths, I want you to head east.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, do you have anything east of the adventure playground?
==F: I have a ...
==G: Up a bit?
==F: I have a ... privately owned field.
==G: Okay, I don't have that.  What you're going to do is you're going to go underneath that field ...
==F: All right.
==G: And you're going to stop at the {fp|uh}, let's see {fp|uh}, southeastern tip of that ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Now, do you have a {ph|go} ... granite quarry, above that?
==F: {fp|Uh}, directly to the north I do, yes.
==G: Okay.  Now what I want you to do is from that {fp|um} ... southeastern tip, is go up to the ... {ab|g} go north to the northeastern tip of the granite quarry.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Now what you're going to do is you're going to go over top of the quarry, and end up on the ... northwestern tip.
==F: All right, I'm there.
==G: Okay?  Now to the {fp|uh} ... southwest, do you have a {fp|uh} train crossing?
==F: I have nothing, to the southwest.
==G: Okay, I ... {fp|Uh}, do you have a waterfall?
==F: I have a waterfall to the {br|ea east=east} ... or to the west, yes.
==G: Okay.  I want you to {fp|um} ... From your point {ab|d} ... on the {fp|um} northwest corner of the granite quarry ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: dip down to {ph|thee=the} ... southwest tip ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And head to {ph|thee=the} ... southwest corner of the waterfall.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now head north up the west side of the waterfall ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Head east along the top of the waterfall until you get to the {fp|uh} ... northeast tip ...
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have anything to the {fp|uh} northeast there?
==F: I have a ... sign there, yeah.
==G: A sign?
==F: A public {ph|totepath=footpath} or something like that.
==G: Okay.  I don't have anything there.  So what I want you to do is head directly north from that {fp|um} ... from {ph|thee=the} ... {fp|uh} northeastern tip of the waterfall ...
==F: All right.
==G: for about {fp|um} half a finger length ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, now from that point, do you have ... let's see {fp|uh} ... southeast ... {fp|uh} fallen cairn?
==F: {fp|Uh}, way off to the far east I do, yes.
==G: Okay, I want you to head for that.
==F: All right.
==G: {ab|Hea} ... Head for the {fp|uh} ... {ab|n} {fp|uh} ... southwestern tip.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Now come around that ... to {ph|thee=the} northeastern tip ...
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have {ph|limefstone=limestone} cliffs above you?
==F: {fp|Uh}, no I don't.
==G: Do you have the east lake?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, what you're going to do now is head for {ph|thee=the} ... See the {le|a} in {ci|lake}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {ab|g} ... Follow that straight down and head for that point. {ab|A} At the {fp|uh} ... the ... the edge of the lake there.
==F: All right.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Now you're going to head east ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have cornfields there?
==F: {fp|Uh} ... to my west, I do.
==G: Yeah, {gg|oh} {ab|s} {ab|s} sorry, west.  {ab|N} Not east. {ab|Di} Disregard that.  Head west.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do ... Do you have cornfields there?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, right in between east lake and the cornfield, put an {le|x} and that's where the finish is.
==G: All right.  Have you got the {fp|uh} start marked {fp|uh} Mike, on the lower right-hand corner on the top of crest falls?
==F: Yeah.  It's {fp|uh} just above the crest falls.
==G: Right.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay. Well, {fp|ehm}, since it's easy to draw lines where they're not going to have to be, shortly thereafter, when you discover there's something there that you didn't know about, I'm going to mention a few of the obstacles that we're going to ... be going around and you can mark them in ahead of time and ... and then we'll draw the line.  {fp|Uh}, do you have a footbridge in about {fp|uh} five fingers northwest of the falls?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have the poisoned stream immediately east of the footbridge?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  About one finger-width away from the footbridge, and with the same northerly boundary but going down about one finger, {fp|uh} {ab|d} in a southerly direction there's going to be a poisoned stream.  It's just an obstacle that we're going to have to go around.
==F: {ab|Oka} ... Do you have a banana tree there?
==G: {fp|Uh}, a banana tree?
==F: Yeah.
==G: No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?
==F: That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.
==G: Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at one point.
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Uh}, do you have the old temple to the east of the footbridge?
==F: {fp|Uh}, yeah.
==G: Okay.  Do you have the abandoned truck, north of the footbridge?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have the hill with baboons on it, southwest of the abandoned truck?
==F: {ph|Nnnno=No}.
==G: Okay, about three fingers southwest of the abandoned truck, there's a hill with baboons on it.  It's just called baboons.
==F: Okay.
==G: It's about the same size as the abandoned truck.  Do you have white mountain north of the abandoned truck?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have the pyramid, northeast of white mountain?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have the cobbled street, south of the pyramid?
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.
==G: Okay.
==F: South of the pyramid, there's a remote village.
==G: All right.  In between the pyramid and the remote village, about {fp|uh} ... forty per cent of the way down from the pyramid to the remote village, and directly above the remote village in terms of east-west, there's a cobbled street with a street lamp on it.
==F: Okay.
==G: We're going to be jogging around that later.
==F: All right.
==G: And that's about all you need to to watch out for.  Okay, we start ... above the crest falls, go west ... about a finger and a half, and then curve southwards so we're just going around the north west {fp|uh} margin of the crest falls heading {br|south westerly=southwesterly} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then, after we get even with the base of crest falls, we start heading westerly, and proceed westerly ... about {ph|ssssix=six} or eight fingers, so that we're about two-thirds or three-quarters of the way towards the edge of the map.
==F: Okay.  So I should be ...
==G: Then we arc ...
==F: I should be coming right under the banana tree, then?
==G: Right.  Okay, that's fine.  And then we arc ... We'll probably be going west of the banana tree and then north ...
==F: Okay.
==G: We arc up to the north, a big right curve.  Go north, towards the baboon hill ...
==F: Okay.  West side of the {ph|boom} ... baboon hill?
==G: {fp|Uh} {ab|n} ... We don't get that far.
==F: Okay.
==G: We then continue arcing to the right, and head right on to that footbridge heading easterly, right into the west ... end of the footbridge and go right across the footbridge.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|W} ... As soon as we get across the footbridge we have to curve immediately southwards to avoid that poisoned stream.
==F: Okay.
==G: We go about two fingers south, and then we head immediately due east, passing on the south side of the poisoned stream.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading right to the old temple now.
==G: {ab|R} ... That's correct.  We now arc to the left, a left turn going north, and we're heading due north as we pass the west side of the old temple, very close to the old temple as we head due north.
==F: Okay.
==G: We go about ... three {ab|f} or four fingers from the base of the old temple, that's about two fingers above the ... the north end of the old temple, and then we alter course to the north west, travel about three or four {ph|ff} ...
==F: So, I'm going to be going up slate mountain, then?
==G: {fp|Uh}, you probably have a mountain in there.
==F: Yeah.
==G: So we're probably going on the east and the northeast sides of slate {br|mou ntain=mountain}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then we get above the top of slate mountain ...
==F: I should be ...
==G: We head ...
==F: right below remote village.
==G: Remote village.  Correct.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, at that point we change course and head south west and pass ... east to west along the south side of the abandoned truck.
==F: Okay.  So I should be, like, right above the baboons or whatever?
==G: That's correct.
==F: Okay.
==G: About half a finger west of the southwest corner of the abandoned truck, you you turn south, and you now dip south, then west, and then north, right around the baboon hill.
==F: Okay.
==G: And after you've finished passing the baboon hill on the west heading north, you'll go east ... or sorry, north northeast, and go right up to the west face of white mountain.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you {ab|par} ... go parallel to the west face of white mountain about a half a finger's ... width away from white mountain.  And when you get to the peak of white mountain, you then head due north.
==F: So I'm going right up to lemon grew?
==G: I would suppose so.
==F: Okay.
==G: And when you get ... even with the base of the pyramid, in a north-southerly orientation, you make a ... sharp ... right ... turn, heading eastwards, towards the pyramid, but you're about one quarter of the way up the height of the pyramid at that point, not right at the base, but about one quarter of the way up.  And you head ...
==F: Okay.
==G: east towards the pyramid, and when you get to the west face of the pyramid, you {ab|g} ... head north east and do the same thing that you did with the other mountains.  You go up to the peak of the pyramid and then down, southeast along the east face.  Of the pyramid.
==F: So I'm just going up and around it?
==G: Right, yeah.  You're just missing it by a half finger's width.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  When you get to the east side of the pyramid you swing ... to the south west, and then the west, and cross underneath the pyramid from east to west.
==F: Okay.
==G: And when you get to the ...
==F: So I'm in between the pyramid and ...
==G: and the cobbled street.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, when you get to the {ab|m} line of the west side of the pyramid, you then head south southwest, and you pass on the west side of the cobbled street, the west side of the remote village, and then swing a ... a left turn or ... towards the east, and cross across west to east, on the south side of the remote village ...
==F: So I'm coming ...
==G: to your finish ... line, and the finish mark is about one finger east of the {le|e} of {ci|remote village}, the final {le|e} of {ci|village}, and about half a finger south of that {le|e}.
==F: Where is it?  Where's the finish point?
==G: {fp|Uh}, half a finger south of the last {le|e} of village, and about one finger-width east of it.
==F: Okay.  Okay.
==G: That's it!
==G: All right.  {fp|Er}, Steve, our our starting point is up in the burnt forest ...
==F: Yeah.  I have it.
==G: Okay.  Our {ab|f} ... I'll just tell you our finishing point, which will be ... Do you have a flagship at the bottom?
==F: Yeah.
==G: right in front of the flagship.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  So that's where we're going to.  Okay.  This is how I want you to start.  I want you to start at the ... {fp|erm} ... let's see, the ... {br|north western=northwestern} edge of the burnt forest ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: What do you have below the burnt forest there?
==F: I have a carpenter's cottage.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is head down the ... western side of the burnt forest ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and once again the western side of the carpenter's cottage ...
==F: All right.
==G: Once you hit the {ab|n} the southernmost point of the carpenter's cottage I want you to ... make a a turn and head east ...
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have a ravine?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to head between the carpenter's cottage and the ravine.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Above the ravine, do you have a remote village?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is head to the top ... the {fp|er} ... northernmost part of the ravine ...
==F: All right.
==G: and keep heading east again ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?  Now stop about one finger width past the ravine.  Do you have a pine grove to the {fp|er} ...
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  I want you to head to the ... {ab|n} {fp|er} ... {br|south western=southwestern} point of the {fp|er} pine grove ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything below that?
==F: An avalanche?
==G: Okay.  I don't have that.
==F: And a concealed hideout?
==G: {ph|Yyyou=You} have an avalanche and a concealed hideout?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now the concealed hideout is ... {ab|fur} {fp|er} southeast of the avalanche?
==F: {fp|Er} ... it's pretty well directly south.
==G: Pretty well directly south?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is ... go around the ... north {fp|er} eastern side of the avalanche ...
==F: All right.
==G: and once again the northeastern side of the concealed hideout ...
==F: All right.
==G: and once you get to the ... southeastern point of the hideout ... I want you to go west.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a boathouse right there?
==F: Directly south I do.
==G: Directly south?
==F: Directly south of the hideout.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, I I've got two boathouses.  Okay?  I've got one right ... Do you ... Do you have the the words {ci|crane bay} written in big on the bay there?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Right about where the {le|a} and the {le|n} are, in {ci|crane} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: if you go up one finger-length, I've got a boathouse there.
==F: All right.
==G: That should be parallel to the concealed hideout.  Now what I want you to do is, from where I left you, head towards where that boathouse would be ... stop at the {fp|er} ... the {le|a} in {ci|bay} ... {ph|mm} {ph|w} like {fp|er} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: parallel to that ...
==F: Seen.  Yeah.
==G: and just head straight south ... to the water's edge.
==F: All right.
==G: Now what you're going to do is follow crane bay around ... Do you ... Do you have a coconut palm?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Follow it {ph|tooo=to} where the {le|c} is in {ci|crane} ...
==F: All right.
==G: and now start heading due west. Do you have a pebbled shore?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  I want you to be on the ... northern part of the pebbled shore, so just above it.
==F: All right.
==G: And then you're going to proceed down the western ... part of the pebbled shore ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have anything below the pebbled shore?
==F: {fp|Er} washed stone.
==G: Okay.  I want you to go around those stones ...
==F: {fp|Er}, which side?  The east or west?
==G: The western side.
==F: All right.
==G: And end up right at the finishing point, right in front of the flagship.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  There we go.
==G: Start! Have you got a {br|c amera=camera} shop marked, in the lower left-hand quadrant?
==F: Yeah.  That's right below start.  Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Have you got a parked van about three fingers' breadth ...
==F: No.
==G: due south?  Of the camera shop?
==F: I have a parked van but it's way up to the north.
==G: {gg|Oh} yeah, I got one up at the top.  That's a different one.
==F: Yeah.  That's the only parked van I have.
==G: Well, you could probably pop in another parked van.
==F: Okay.  Where is it located?
==G: It's about {fp|uh} ... There'd be a gap of about {fp|uh} two and a half to three fingers' breadths.  Otherwise it looks the same, same orientation, but it's south of the camera shop.
==F: Okay.
==G: About two and a half fingers' width of space between the two.
==F: Okay.
==G: Have you got the allotments, to the east southeast of the camera shop?
==F: Yeah.  That would sort of be in the middle of the van and the camera shop, wouldn't it?
==G: {gg|Mmm}?
==F: That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...
==G: {fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van is due south of the camera shop.
==F: Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the middle of them.
==G: Bring the van over?
==F: No.  The {fp|uh} alloitments in between the camera shop and the van?
==G: {gg|Oh}!  Well, yeah, these allotments are at least a finger's breadth away from the camera shop and about a finger's breadth below it. The parked van's about three fingers below it.
==F: Okay, all right.
==G: Due south.  So I might as well just get started.  You start there, go to the west, or south west about one finger's width, and then veer {ab|st} straight south, passing down the west side of the camera shop, as you go south.
==F: Okay, am I going to pass the van?
==G: Go right down to the front of the van and underneath it, and cross from west to east under the south side of the parked van.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you swing north.  As soon as you get to the back end of the van you go due north, so you're heading up just eastwards of the camera shop but westwards of the allotments on the west side of the allotments.  And you just skirt the allotments, and then you immediately alter course, to the east northeast.  So you're going to pass on the northerly side of the allotments as you head east northeast.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: You go about two thirds the width of the page and then make a sharp northerly turn.  Then you're going due north.  You've probably got something marked there that you're making a corner turn around.
==F: What is that?  The abandoned ...
==G: Doesn't really matter, but ...
==F: monastery?
==G: There's probably some ... object.  Have you got an abandoned monastery?
==F: Yeah.  So, am am I going up towards there?
==G: You will be going up to it, and you'll be passing over the north side of the abandoned monastery from east ...
==F: Okay, so I have ... I have to curve ... I have to go up with the lake lake, then, right?
==G: {fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand side or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something in between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five fingers' breadth ...
==F: Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?
==G: {fg|Oh}.  No. You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't have west lake.
==F: Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.
==G: Okay.  Well ...
==F: And it's about ...
==G: It'll be inside the big loop that you're making.
==F: Okay.
==G: But you just go a straight line, east northeast from the north west corner of the allotments.  Take it about eight fingers' breadth and that's where you then go due north to meet the {ab|r} east side of the abandoned monastery.
==F: Okay.  D'you have a flight museum?
==G: No.
==F: No, okay.  So I'm right at the {fp|uh} southeast corner ...
==G: of the abandoned monastery.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, now you just make a ... a crescent-shaped arc, over top of the abandoned monastery, you're heading northwest, then west, then southwest, just to go right around the abandoned monastery, and you're on, then {ph|on-nn=on} the west southwest corner of the abandoned monastery ...
==F: Okay.
==G: having passed it on the north side of it.  Now there's ... Do you have {ph|aaa=a} youth hostel, south of the parked van at the top?
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.
==G: {fp|Uh}, an alpine garden?
==F: Yeah, that's further down, though.
==G: Okay.
==F: It's just up to the {fp|uh} northwest of the abandoned monastery.
==G: Right.  Well, northeast of the alpine garden, and south of the parked van at the top, about equidistant between those two objects, is a youth hostel.
==F: Okay.
==G: Might as well just throw it in, just a little house.
==F: D'you have a ... a {ph|levver} crossing? thing's this? level crossing?
==G: Level crossing?  Like railroad?
==F: Yeah.  Well, it's not a railroad.  It's ... looks like a ... a gate, sort of.
==G: {fg|Oh}.  Well, we don't have that one here.  {fp|Uh} ...
==F: It's directly below the east lake.
==G: {gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you ... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to the point where you head north ...
==F: Okay.
==G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.
==F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...
==G: Sure.
==F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
==G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.
==F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|Y} ... Up the west side, and then across to north side.
==F: All right.  Okay, okay.
==G: Anyway, the {fp|uh} ... After leaving the abandoned monastery you're heading south west for just a half finger, and then you start curving ... slowly ... to the right, clockwise so you're probably avoiding something, and then you go due north, right up the west side of the alpine garden.  So that's how you get from the abandoned monastery to the alpine garden.  Then we're ...
==F: So I'm curving around the alpine garden?
==G: Right.
==F: Okay.
==G: And when you get to the northwest corner of the alpine garden, you make a ... a {ph|ssssudden=sudden} change from northerly to easterly.
==F: Okay.
==G: That's at a right angle turn to the right.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you get near the ... easterly part of alpine garden on the north border ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And you suddenly make a left-hand turn and veer {fp|uh} fairly sharply.  Go due north then to avoid the {fp|uh} youth hostel and to pass on the west side of the youth hostel as you go from south to north.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then when you get to the northwest corner of the youth hostel, you make another fairly sharp right turn, and are then heading east across the northerly border of the youth hostel.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: When you get to the northeast corner of the youth hostel, you make an {fp|uh} a fairly abrupt course alteration, and then head south east.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you'll be passing about eight finger-widths.  And you'll be just missing the previous track, when you went up past the {ab|abandon} ... excuse me ... abandoned monastery by about one finger-width.
==F: So, d'you ... Am I going right for a telephone box?
==G: Yeah.  You, you ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You're heading for the {le|t} of {ci|telephone} and you're ... then you're going to go ...
==F: All right.  There.
==G: west to east across the bottom of the word {ci|telephone box}.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then, when you get past the {le|x} you go due north, about two and a half finger-widths ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {gg|Ah} ... Do you have ...
==F: So I should be just at the top of the telephone?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: But on the northeast corner of it, sort of.
==F: yeah, yeah.
==G: Do you have a thatched mud hut, south of east lake?
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.  I have a level ... level crossing.
==G: Okay.
==F: So I guess that would be it.
==G: Well, if you take the ... south east corner of east lake, about one and a half finger-widths south of it, just put a little hut.  That's the thatched mud hut.
==F: Yeah, that's where the ... That's ... That's exactly where the {fp|uh} level crossing is.
==G: {gg|Oh}, okay.  Where ... {ab|Th} {ab|Th} This is the east ... southeast corner of east lake.  Okay.  Anyway, so you then ... Leaving the northeast corner of the telephone box, you go {ip|bout=about} one and a half fingers north west, and start arcing to the north, {ip|til=until} you're going due north, right up, underneath the ... the word {ci|east lake}, you're heading towards the lake.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you're almost in the middle of it.
==F: Yeah.  Right there.
==G: And you're ... you're just avoiding this thatched mud hut ...
==F: Okay.
==G: by making that little curve to the west, northwest and then north.
==F: Okay.
==G: When you get about a ... a half a finger's breadth from east lake, you turn left, proceed on until you're about a half ... one finger's breadth past the {fp|uh} corner there, on the {ab|l} south west corner and you put your {le|x}.
==F: That's where ...
==G: You're moving parallel to the east lake, you know, west northwest or ...
==F: Okay.
==G: West northwest by {br|w est=west} at that point.  That's it.
==F: That's it?
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==F: Right at east lake, that's it?
==G: {ab|Y} ... Well, one finger's breadth west ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: of that, southwest of the southwest corner.
==F: Okay.
==F: Okay, John.  Start.
==G: Okay, Richard.  Okay.  The ... You have the start at the top of the page?
==F: Yeah.  {ph|Biii} ... I've got a burnt forest there.
==G: Yeah.  It's {ab|r} ... Okay, it's right next to the burnt forest, there.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay.  From your start you're going to go just ... curve right along that ... the edge of burnt forest there ... and then {ab|a} ...
==F: {fp|Er}, {ab|th} the west edge?
==G: Yes.
==F: Okay.
==G: And at the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest} ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: you're going to make a little curve ...
==F: Curve where?
==G: Just a little curve inward, in towards the {le|u} a little bit ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then curve out again ... Make a ... Curve out again ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: Do you have a ravine?  Down there?
==F: I've got a ravine.
==G: Just west over there?
==F: {fp|Er}, {ab|southw} southeast, I have a ravine.
==G: Just southeast, yeah.  Of the burnt forest?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to make a little curve out, so that you're back in line with the ... the start ... So you're going to {ab|g} ... like, curve in at the {le|b}. Just make a little curve in ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: then curve back out ... and then, at the bottom of the ravine, not the word {ci|ravine}, the ravine itself ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: you're going to head west.
==F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?
==G: Right.
==F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?
==G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...
==F: Okay.
==G: go west.
==F: Okay.  I got it.
==G: Okay?  And then ... You see the top of the ravine?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay? Don't go right up along the side, just curve up gradually, up around, and over the top of the {ph|vravine=ravine} ... and {ab|abo} ...
==F: Okay.  Hang on a second here. Okay.  From the {ab|bur} ... From {ph|theee=the} the the {le|b} of the {ab|bur} or from the {le|u} of the {ci|burnt forest} I was supposed to curve?  And then from {ab|wh} there, where do I go?  From the {le|u} of {ci|burnt forest}?
==G: Okay.  Just make a little curve ... eastward, and then back out, westward, {ab|abou} at the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest}.  Okay?  Just curve in a little bit ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: Then {ab|gradual} gradually come out.  And then stop ... when you're in line ... with the bottom of the ravine ... and ... {ab|tha} that point should also be in line with the north point of {ci|start}. So that point right there.
==F: Should be in line with what?
==G: In line with the start.
==F: With the start?
==G: Yeah, with the start point.  You should be in line, like they should ... be in the same line, you know?
==F: I ... No, I don't have that.
==G: {ab|Wha} ... What do {ab|y} ... No.  Like, the ... Just {ph|ii} with the word {ci|start} ...
==F: Yeah?
==G: It should be in the ... When you come out of your curve and stop ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you should stop so that you're in {ab|l} ... directly underneath ... the {le|a} in {ci|start}.
==F: {gg|Oh} okay.  So {ab|basic} ...
==G: Just ... In line with it.
==F: Okay.  So, from the ravine I'm going west ... until I'm on with start?
==G: No, no, no.  From the burnt forest ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: you make your little curve ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: inward towards the east.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Then you go back out west ...
==F: Okay.  How far do I {ab|cur} ... Like, how far do I make this curve?
==G: Just curve in a little bit, just in towards the {le|b}.  That's it.
==F: Just in towards the {le|b}.  So, curve ... to the right? Is that what you're saying?
==G: You'll be curving ... Curve in towards ... like, the ravine in a way, you know what I mean?
==F: Not really.
==G: Okay, then.  This is ... Do you have anything next to the burnt forest there or anything?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Below the burnt forest I have carpenter's cottage, and that is west of the ravine.
==G: West?  Okay.
==F: It's west of the ravine and it's south of burnt forest.
==G: Okay.  Well just ... Go right around that then.  Go right around ...
==F: Okay.  I'm just going around it.
==G: {ab|Ye} ... Just ... Yeah.  {ab|Tha} that's why I have this space.  Go around it ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then go due east towards the ravine ... right in line with the bottom of the ravine ...
==F: Okay.  So go ... east towards the ravine then?
==G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...
==F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?
==G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of the ravine ...
==F: Yeah?
==G: just start ... curve upwards, up north ...
==F: Curve north then?
==G: Yeah.  That's how ... {ab|wha} what it was before ... Then when you get the top of the ravine, curve so that you're going east then again ... You've curved up and gone north.  Now you've curved and going east ...
==F: Okay.  So let me get this thing straight here.  From the start I go {ph|ssssou} I go south how far?
==G: South, so that you're in line with the word ... so that you're in line with the bottom of the ravine.  How about that?
==F: Okay.  That's ...
==G: Can you do that? ...
==F: Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve over the top of this carpenter's ...
==G: No, no, no.
==F: Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...
==G: Right.  Then go east ...
==F: and then curve ... east, okay.
==G: and then curve up north ...
==F: North, okay.  Got it.
==G: and then curve over top of the ravine ...
==F: Okay.  Got it.
==G: and come around ... Do you have a remote village above the ravine?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Well then, just curve over the top of the ravine.  Do you have pine grove there?
==F: Yes.  I have pine grove to the {ab|wes} ... east.
==G: Okay.  As you come over the top of the ravine, curve down along the west side of the pine grove ...
==F: Curve down along the west side of the pine grove?  Okay.
==G: Yeah.  And then ... Do you have anything right below the pine grove or anything?
==F: {fp|Er}, southeast of it I have the avalanche.
==G: Okay.  Well I don't have that, so what you're going to do is curve around to the east of that ...
==F: The east of where?
==G: Of your avalanche.  That ... {ab|s} ...
==F: So, how far south do I go, once I hit the west side of pine grove?
==G: You just go to the bottom of pine grove ...
==F: To the bottom of pine grove.  Okay.
==G: Okay.  And then curve around it.  You'll have to curve around it, won't you?  {ab|Ma} ...
==F: Curve around the bottom?  Of pine grove?
==G: Okay.  You've come ... south, along ... down to the the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove}, okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay?  Now make a little curve ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: starting at the {le|p} in {ci|pine} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: to the end of {ci|grove}.  Just make a little curve all the way out ...
==F: Okay.
==G: So you're making like a little half moon kind of ...
==F: Yeah.  Got it.
==G: And then make another one ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: {ph|Zz} ... {ip|Cause=Because} your ... This this ... half moon'll be pointing almost, like, southwest ... Right?
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: Okay.  Now make another one so that you're going back out east.  Do you have a ... concealed hideout there?
==F: Yes, I have a concealed hideout.
==G: Okay.  Well then, just ... Go in line.  Go go right around the concealed hideout ...
==F: Around where?
==G: Circle right around the {ab|l} ... out the {ab|we} ... the east side, sorry, the east side of the concealed hideout ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, where should I be from this curve?
==G: Just make a little curve.  I don't have anything unless you do. {ab|I} It's only you ...
==F: I've got a avalanche above the {ab|h} ... concealed hideout.
==G: To the ...
==F: Do you want me to curve past ... like, around the the avalanche.  Is it nearer the edge?
==G: Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's where you're supposed to tell me if you have something there.
==F: Okay.  All right.  So then I curve ... Now I'm ... I'm on the {ab|ea} east side of the concealed hideout.
==G: Yeah.  You should be on the east side.
==F: Yeah.
==G: You're curving right around it ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then going straight along ... the bottom of the word {ci|{ph|concede} hideout} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And then, do you have a boathouse there?
==F: I have a boathouse to the {br|south east=southeast}.
==G: Okay.  Don't worry about it then.  You see the the highest point in crane bay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Stop there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Er}, as you're coming along straight east from concealed hideout ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  Then come {ab|u} ... Go go south and go around in that little ... half moon of crane bay ...
==F: Okay.  Got it.
==G: then circle over top of the ... second point in crane bay ...
==F: Got it.
==G: Then do you have a coconut palm there?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Well then keep following ... the ... the edge of the ... crane bay ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: southward, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then when you get to the ... You see where the {le|c} is in {ci|crane bay}?
==F: The sea?  {ab|Wh} ...
==G: The {le|c} in {ci|crane bay}.
==F: {gg|Oh} yeah.  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah.
==G: Go ... west.
==F: Go west.  Okay.
==G: Go west.  And then do you have a pebbled {ab|ston} ... a pebbled shore, there?
==F: Yes, I've got pebbled shores.
==G: Okay.  You're going west ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: then curve over the top and come down the west side of the pebbled shore ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything below the pebbled shore?
==F: I've got washed stones {ab|belo} below, {br|south west=southwest} of it.
==G: Okay.  Then curve out the west side of it ...
==F: West side of washed stones?
==G: Yeah.  And {ab|g} stop right ... on the shore, right by the flagship. You have a flagship there?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Stop right on the shore, right before you get to the ... edge of the shore where the flagship is.
==F: Okay.
==G: There.
==G: Okay.  Start point is {ph|aaaa=a} camp ... two {ph|tentsss=tents}, a fireplace ... in the centre.
==F: {fp|Er} ... {fg|Eh} start is above that?
==G: Yes it is.
==F: Yeah.
==G: {fp|Er} ... Go {ab|t} ... straight over ... to the tent on the left ... so that you're straight above it.
==F: {fp|Er}, sorry.  Go ahead.  {fp|Er}, {fp|er} say that again.
==G: {fp|Er}, go straight ... across to your ... atop ... the tent pole ... on the tent on the left ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Er}, have you got ... gorillas?
==F: No.
==G:  Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... Curve down along the side of the tent ... {ip|til=until} you get to ... the the camp ... {br|m monastery=monastery} camp ... the print ... and then stop. Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... {br|H have} you got anything around that area?
==F: {fp|Er} no ...
==G: In line with the camp?
==F: {fp|Er} {ab|b} ... Beside the camp but {fp|er} rather far to the left, I have a banana tree.
==G: Okay.  How far to the left?
==F: {fp|Er} ... About as far from the left edge of the page as the camp is from the right edge of the page.
==G: Okay.  You're going to be going in between that, then.  Approximately, four finger spaces ... to the right ... go straight across ... and start curving up.  North.
==F: Okay.  So, right now I'm stopped ... parallel with the writing of {ci|missionary camp}.
==G: Yes.
==F: {ab|Oka} ...
==G: Now go straight across the page ... west.
==F: {br|G go=go} straight across the page west?  Okay.
==G: And {fp|er} {ab|fo} {fp|er} ...
==F: I'm heading for a banana tree now.
==G: Okay.  Approximately four finger spaces, from the edge of the page, stop.
==F: Now should I go under the banana tree or over the banana tree?
==G: How many fingers is the {fp|er} tree from the bottom?
==F: {ip|Bout=About} four.
==G: About four?  Okay, you'll probably be going over it, then.
==F: Well, the bottom of the banana tree is about four or five fingers. The top of the banana tree is more than that.
==G: {ph|T-huh}. You'll be ... You'll be going alongside of it then, probably. Have you got a rope bridge?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, you'll you'll be going straight up towards it and curving into it.
==F: Okay.  From {ab|wher} {ab|I} ... From where I am ... {ab|b} at the missionary camp ...
==G: {gg|Mmm}.
==F: am I going north, east, south, or west? I'm {ab|stil} ...
==G: Okay.  You'll be ... From the missionary camp you're going west towards the banana tree.
==F: Okay.  Now.  When I get {br|t to=to} the banana tree, do I go north?
==G: You'll ... You'll go north ... and then you'll turn west, onto the bridge.
==F: Okay.
==G: Or, east.  Correction.
==F: Okay.
==G: You'll cross over the bridge ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: curve down approximately one finger ... and then ... Do you have waterfalls?
==F: Yes.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you'll be going over to the waterfalls ... {fp|er} {ab|t} ... along line with the mist.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Along the edge of the waterfalls, have you got ... lost steps? Above?
==F: No.
==G: {gg|Hmm}.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you want me to go over the waterfalls?
==G: No.  Alongside of it.
==F: Up?
==G: {fg|Eh} up north.
==F: Up alongside of it?
==G: Up north alongside of it.  Like ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You'll be going along the left side of it ...
==F: Yes.
==G: and then up north ...
==F: Yes.
==G: but you haven't got lost steps.
==F: No.
==G: Have you got any ...
==F: {fp|Er} I have lost steps but they're ... very far north of the waterfall.
==G: Okay.  No, no, no.  What you {fp|er} ... You have to go ... four fingers up, and then start turning to the left.  Have you got {br|f fallen=fallen} pillars?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  You'll be going ... north, just above the pillars, and then you'll be turning ... west ...
==F: Okay ... {ab|Ri} ...
==G: and going under the pillars ...
==F: Okay, before we do that.  Right now I'm {ab|par} ... I'm right {ab|bes} ... on the left side of the waterfall.
==G: Yes.
==F: {ab|We} ... Do you want me to go north?
==G: You go north ...
==F: Or east or {ab|we}?  {br|Wh where=Where} do you want me to go?
==G: Go north ...
==F: Okay.  How far?
==G: {fp|Er} ... {ip|til=until} you reach ... {fp|er} lined up with the top of the pillars.
==F: Okay.
==G: The ...
==F: Now?
==G: Now, you'll go left ... and down, slope down ... towards ... the the print, {ci|pillars} ...
==F: You want me to go under the pillars or {ab|un} ...
==G: Under the pillars, towards the words {ci|fallen pillars}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Your line will end at the end of the {le|f}.
==F: At ... I'm underneath the {le|f}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now.  {ab|Ha} ... Have you got ancient ruins?  Above the pillars, and a bit to the left?
==F: I've got a ruined city, above the pillars and a bit to the left.
==G: They're ancient ruins?  Or ruined cities?
==F: I I have a ruined city.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er} ...
==F: I also have gazelles to the left of that.
==G: {gg|Hmm}.
==F: I'm right underneath the fallen ... the wording ... the the the the words {ci|fallen pillars} now.
==G: Okay.
==F: Now, {br|wh where=where} do I go?
==G: You're going to be heading ... two fingers south ... and then, curve around ... two fingers west ... and then head north ... until {fp|er} ... Have you got lost steps?  Or {fp|er} stones, I should say.
==F: Have I got what?
==G: They're alongside white mountain at the top of the page.
==F: Yeah.  I I {ab|ha} ... White mountain is in the top, right-hand corner of the page, and south ...
==G: Is a ...
==F: {br|south east=southeast} of the white mountain is lost steps.
==G: Lost steps.  Okay. Your {ab|s} ... You have stones, on the mountain, called lost steps. There's {fp|er} four stones.  Big stones.  At the top of the page. Left-hand corner?
==F: I have nothing in the top left-hand corner of my page.
==G: Okay.  You have the curve at the bottom where I told you to curve?
==F: Okay.  Right now I'm below fallen pillars.  I'm heading south, you said?
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, curve down south.
==F: South.  And I'm ... I I have some flamingoes ...
==G: Okay.
==F: to my left now.
==G: You're going to have to curve around them then.
==F: Okay.  I'm going to go under them?
==G: Yes.
==F: Okay.  Now, head what?  Head north?
==G: Head north.
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Er}, {ip|til=until} you ...
==F: {ab|No} now I'm I'm I'm heading north and if I continue heading north I will be just west of the ruined city.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er} ... Five finger lengths ... from the edge of white mountain, the left side of white mountain ...
==F: {ab|Oka} ...
==G: go straight up there.
==F: My white mountain is in the top right-hand corner of my page.
==G: Yeah ... Yeah.
==F: That's where you want me to go?
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, go five finger lengths ... or four finger lengths ... from the edge of white mountain ... straight up {ab|t} ... straight up north.
==F: Okay ...
==G: Okay?
==F:  {ab|He} ... {br|N no=No}, that's not okay.  I've just gone south and underneath the flamingoes.  I'm about ... {ab|ha} ... I'm {br|y you=you} {ab|kno} ... I am halfway up ... the page, and on the west side of my page.  That's where I am right now.
==G: The west side of your ...
==F: I'm half way up up my page ...
==G: Okay ... Yeah?
==F: and I'm on the west side of my page.
==G: Okay.
==F: Now where do you want me to go?
==G: Keep going north {ip|til=until} you line up with white mountain.
==F: So I'm going to be going north {ab|ver} {fp|er} a long way?
==G: Yes.  A long way.
==F: Okay, I'm ... I've gone north.  I'm in the top left-hand corner of my page now.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, are you lined up with white mountain?
==F: I'm lined up with white mountain.
==G: Okay.  Head towards white mountain ...
==F: I'm ...
==G: and curve around it.
==F: Around it over it or under it?
==G: Over it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Have you got {fp|er} ... the biggest ...
==F: I'm right on top of white mountain now.
==G: Okay.  Go all the way around the edge ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: around, and straight underneath it ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Have you got {fp|er} ... biggest furniture store?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.
==F: If I continue {ph|goingge=going} west ... I'm going to hit the rock fall.
==G: Okay.  Stop at the edge of white mountain, then. On the {fp|er} left side.  On the west side.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, you're going to be {ab|g} ... Have {ph|hyy=you} got gazelles below white mountain?
==F: No.  Yes!
==G: Three gazelles?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  You're going to be heading down towards them, south, and then you're going to be turning right ... underneath the gazelles.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  And approximately two fingers from the gazelles ... is your finish point.
==F: Two fingers {ab|ea} {ph|oo} west?
==G: On the east side of the gazelles.  The right side.
==F: The right side?
==G: Yes.  Past the gazelles.
==F: Okay.
==G: It'd be ... the east side, then.
==F: {ab|Th} the east side?
==G: Yeah.  Just past the gazelles, two fingers.
==F: Okay.  That's it?
==G: Yeah.  That's your finish point there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, is your start point just off centre left at the top?
==F: Yes it is.
==G: And {ph|yourrr=your} final point is down ... {fp|er} {ab|left-han} ... almost to the left-hand corner or up about three inches?
==F: {fg|Er} I don't have a final point.
==G: Okay, well that'll be your final point.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: Three inches up from the left-hand corner?
==G: {fg|Er} ... And in {ab|a} ... in about two inches.
==F: {ph|Oookay=Okay}.
==G: Okay?  So up three and in two.
==F: Right below my start mark, I have a diamond mine?
==G: Yeah, so do I.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: This is the same one I used last time. Anyways, {fg|erm}, right beside your diamond mine, do you have a wagon wheel?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay so ...
==F: Left or right side?
==G: Right side about two inches you'll have a wagon wheel.
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have a rift valley?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Below rift valley you have a cactus, right?
==F: Yes.
==G: Below that do you have the rocks?
==F: {ab|Y} ... Two big ... Two rocks, yes.
==G: Yeah, okay.  Now okay, to the left of that, stony creek?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay.  Directly in line with that, over ... {ip|bout=about} two and a half inches is stony creek.
==F: Directly in line with the rocks?
==G: Yeah. ... Okay, you got white water {br|u under=under} that?
==F: {fg|Er}, I have rapids.
==G: Okay.  And under your rapids you've got {fp|er} ... {fp|er} ...
==F: A manned fort.
==G: A fort?  A fort, yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, to {ab|th} ...
==F: Now, is the creek underneath ... above the rapids?
==G: The {ab|r} ... The ... No, the {fp|er} ... The rapids is above the fort, right?
==F: {fg|Ah} yes it is.
==G: Okay, then to the right of that you'll have outlaws' ... {fp|er} hideaway?  Or hideout?
==F: {fp|Er} yes.
==G: Okay, and under that you have a diamond mine, I think, right?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Or a gold mine?
==F: {ab|Diamon} ... {fp|Er} gold mine.
==G: Yeah, okay.  Then under that you got the noose?
==F: Noose, yeah.
==G: Okay, to the left of that, you don't have a swan pond, right?
==F: That's right.
==G: Okay, {ab|u} ...
==F: I have {fp|er} stone slabs?
==G: Okay, well right under stone slabs ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Okay, about {br|a an=an} inch ... Okay, follow ... under the {ab|s} ... right under the stone slabs ... an inch below the noose, okay? In in line with the {fp|er} stone slabs ...
==F: Okay.
==G: there's a ... a pond.  So right under the ... The pond's right under the slabs, just below the level of the noose.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  And then beside that there's the saloon bar?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, the top left-hand corner of the saloon bar?
==F: Top left, okay.
==G: Okay?  Over about an inch and a half is our finish point.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, so where we're going to start, {ab|r} start up there. {ip|Kay=Okay}, we're going to come down the left-hand side of the diamond mine ...
==F: All right.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, go round the diamond mine back up, around the right-hand side of the wagon wheel?
==F: Around the right-hand side of the wagon wheel, okay ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: so ... like that.
==G: Okay?
==F: Okay, up towards the rift?
==G: Yeah, keep going up towards the rift.  {ab|Th} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, go over that little cactus at the top of the rift there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Come around the right-hand side of that, down the middle of the valley ... the valley ...
==F: Down the middle of the rift valley?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, come down towards the rocks ...
==F: Straight down?
==G: Yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, then you'll go between stony creek and the rocks.  Go to the middle of there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, go under stony creek ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: go over top of the {ab|w} ... the ... the {ab|w} rapids ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, come down the left-hand side of the rapids ...
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, come underneath your fort ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, go over to where it says {ci|outlaws'} ...
==F: That's coming down the left side of the fort, right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Come {ab|dow} ... Go over now to where it says {ci|outlaws' hideout} and the mind. Go between those two, almost to the edge of the page ...
==F: {fp|Er} ...
==G: Edge of the map ...
==F: Okay, straight between the two.
==G: Yeah, then come down from there, around under the noose ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ab|k} you'd go to the ... the side of the pond, but not in the pond ...
==F: {ab|Wai} ... Okay, I don't have a pond, so ...
==G: I have the ... Okay {ph|dll} just go over ... about ... two and a half inches ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Make a little half circle for the ... upwards.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so the half circle goes up and then back down, for about ... {ip|bout=about} two inches wide.  You know what I mean?
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, then you go under the saloon ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, then you go up to the finish point.
==F: Done.
==G: Okay.  Good.
==G: {ph|Okaaay=Okay}.  Have you got east lake on yours?
==F: Yes, top ... right-hand corner.
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, good.  Go to the west corner of east lake ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: lower west corner.  And just about an inch out, that's the finish.
==F: Okay ... Got it.
==G: Okay.  Start point.  Have you got set of forest down the bottom left of your map?
==F: Site of forest fire?
==G: Site of forest ... fire, you're right.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay.  On the top of the site of forest fire, right about dead centre, put {ci|start point}.
==F: I have the start.
==G: You got the start?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Do you have, below site of fire, picnic site?
==F: {fp|Uh}, I have an adventure playground that's sort of a jungle gym and some tyres?
==G: Okay, yeah, just leave that.  That's good.  Then straight down from site ... of the forest fire ... go down about three-quarters the length of your pen and put {ci|picnic site}.
==F: Directly below site of fire?
==G: Yeah, directly below.  It's right straight down underneath it. Three-quarters the length of a pen.
==F: Got it.
==G: And then just mark in {ci|picnic site} right underneath there and we got it.  You got adventure playground?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, we're heading east from adventure {ph|playcrowned=playground}. We go about three-quarters of the way across the page.  Do you have anything there?
==F: {fp|Uh}, I've I've got privately owned fields above adventure playground to the right and {ph|belowww=below} it to the right I have farmyard.
==G: Yeah, okay, no problem then.  Okay, privately owned field?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Be ... Okay. And then we go ... north, after we're across three-quarters of the page and we go up and we got granite quarry.  Do you have that?
==F: Got it.
==G: You got it?  Okay.  To the left ... of the granite quarry, there's train crossing.
==F: Don't have that.
==G: Okay.
==F: I have waterfall to the left.
==G: Okay, right ... directly below the waterfall, but slightly right, put in {ci|train crossing}.  Leave a gap of about an inch and a half between the word {ci|waterfall} and the top of your train crossing.
==F: Okay, so train crossing going north and south or east and west or on an angle?
==G: It's straight across, east to ... east to west. I'm looking at the lights.  They're blinking.  There's a train coming!
==F: Got it.
==G: Got it? We're all set there?
==F: Yeah.  I said got it.
==G: Okay.  Waterfall, you've got?
==F: Correct.
==G: Okay.  We're heading north now, on the left-hand side of the waterfall ... and we curve a bit to the left, about an inch and a half, or curve a left to the right, about and inch and a half, and straight up from that you'll see cornfield?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, you got the east lake?
==F: Yeah.
==G: East lake?  Right directly below the eastern corner of east lake it says {ci|{ph|line} limestone cliffs}.
==F: No, I have {fp|uh} public footpath or lion country.
==G: {ph|Awwkaay=Okay}. But it's directly below the eastern, bottom, southern corner of {fp|uh} ... east lake?
==F: {ab|Ok} okay, the the {ab|south} ... southeast corner ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: Not where the finish line is?
==G: No, not where the finish line is.
==F: That's the southwest corner.
==G: That's right.  Southeast corner.
==F: Southeast corner, the only thing I have over on that side is about ... directly below the {ab|lev} ... the word {ci|east} in {ci|east lake}, on level with public footpath, is lion country.
==G: Okay, I don't have ... Okay.  Lion country, don't have that.  Okay, this one's going to be a little bit better. Okay, so the southeastern corner, go down about one quarter of the pen and mark in {ci|limestone cliffs}.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay?  And then down from limestone cliffs about {fp|uh} half the pen length, and over slightly to the west, mark in {ci|fallen} ...
==F: I have that one.
==G: {ci|cairn}.
==F: I have that.
==G: You got fallen cairn?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, let's go back to the start.
==F: Okay.
==G: Start point.  Fire site.  Fire {fp|uh} ... Site of forest fire.
==F: Got it.
==G: Go around the left-hand side ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: straight down ... underneath ... the picnic site ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and swing back up, where you're almost even with the {le|e} in {fp|uh} {ci|forest fire} ... Swing back up north ...
==F: Okay, am I going ...
==G: You're going ...
==F: to the west of adventure playground?
==G: Picnic site.  Yeah, you're going to the {fp|uh} left-hand side.
==F: Okay.
==G: The west side.
==F: Got it.
==G: And straight up ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And you should be directly in line with the {le|e} in {ci|fire}.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay, start heading ... east, for about ... the length of a pen.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, and stop when you're at the length of the pen ...
==F: So just before ... like, if you came straight up off of the {le|f} in {ci|farmyard}?
==G: You head ... {le|F} in {ci|farmyard}?
==F: Or ... Do you have that?  Or do you have ...
==G: Yeah, the farmyard's down in the bottom right-hand corner of mine.
==F: Yeah, but if you just came straight up from the {le|f}, is that as far over ...
==G: That's ... Yeah, that's perfect!
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Then head {ab|st} straight north ...
==F: So I'm just going up the ... right-hand side of privately owned fields?
==G: Privately owned fields.  And the granite quarry on top?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You got the granite quarry?  Okay, head straight up towards the granite quarry, go over the top of it, just missing it by about a quarter of an inch, all the way round.
==F: Okay.
==G: Once you get to the left-hand side ... of ...
==F: There.
==G: You're there?
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay, start bending down and go in between waterfall and train crossing.
==F: Yeah.
==G: And head right up the right {fp|uh} the left-hand side of waterfall directly north.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay?  Curve into the far right-hand edge of waterfall, where you see the mountain ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: just only about an inch and a half, then head directly north for about two inches.
==F: Okay, where am I going in relationship to public footpath?
==G: I don't have the public footpath.  So what I want you to do {ab|i} ...
==F: Okay, do you have cornfields?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay, {ab|pub} ...
==G: You're about two inches below cornfield, heading north.
==F: Okay.
==G: Stop there.
==F: Got it.  I'm there.
==G: Got it?  Okay.  Now we curve on a forty-five degree angle, down towards fallen cairn.  You have that?
==F: Yeah.
==G: So almost a straight line heading down towards fallen cairn ...
==F: Okay, am I going under it?
==G: Go underneath fallen cairn.  Make a wide loop ... and just leave about a quarter of an inch on either side ...
==F: There.
==G: Okay, head back up north {ab|ea} {fg|er} northwest ... missing limestone cliffs.
==F: Yeah.
==G: by about half an inch.  Get up to the lake until you're about a quarter of an inch away from the lake ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Follow the lake heading west ... to the finish point.  Which is about one inch from the bottom ...
==F: There.
==G: southeast. of the ... There?
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, you want to read it back to me?
==F: Okay from the {ab|s} ...
==G: Okay Brian, you ready?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Let's make this a quick one.  Do we have {fp|uh} crest falls?  Down at the bottom of start point?
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay.  Do you have, just above that, off to the right, old temple?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  You go about two inches to the left, and there should be poison stream.
==F: Don't have that.
==G: Okay, put in {fp|uh} just an {le|x} there and a cross-bones or whatever, and it's just slightly below the level of the temple, the bottom of the temple?  {ip|Bout=About} two inches over.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, and about another half inch over from that ... you'll have footbridge.  Same as we had on the last one?
==F: Right.
==G: Four poles and ...
==F: Okay, that's only ... a half inch from the poison river?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay, I was over closer to the temple.  Okay, I'll put it over closer to the footbridge.
==G: Okay, {ip|cause=because} ... So you have footbridge then, {fg|eh}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: So as we go around we got crest falls we make a big turn, footbridge, poison stream, old temple.  And we'll make a big round up.  You got abandoned truck?
==F: Yeah, beside slate mountain.
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, I haven't got slate mountain.  So where's slate mountain?  In conjunction with the truck?
==F: Slate ... Slate mountain ... The abandoned truck is about half way up slate mountain ... and slate mountain {ph|iiis=is} between the old temple and abandoned truck, sort of in that centre portion, there.
==G: In the centre portion?  So like on a forty-five degree angle across one another?
==F: {fp|Uh} ... No actually, like, {fp|um} ... {gg|hmm}. {ci|Slate mountain} the actual word ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: is in line with the top of the ... point on the old temple ...
==G: Okay, good.  That gives me an idea where to go.  Slate mountain?
==F: Yeah.
==G: indecipherableSpeech Okay.  You got abandoned truck?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, we go down to baboons ...
==F: Don't have baboons.
==G: Okay.  Right underneath abandoned truck, where the {le|a} is, go down two inches, over half an inch, and put a little mountain ... and baboons on it. Okay?
==F: Yeah, got it.
==G: Okay.  We'll be going around that.  Have you got white mountain?
==F: Yes.
==G: Have you got pyramid?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, underneath the pyramid, have you got cobblestone street?
==F: No, I have remote village.
==G: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah okay, in between remote village and {fp|uh} the pyramid ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: cobblestone street.
==F: Okay.  {ab|Wh} What ...
==G: So put it ... just about in the centre.
==F: In line with the {le|y} {ab|i} ...
==G: In in line with the right {fp|uh} left-hand edge of the pyramid ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And the left-hand ... and right in line with the {le|r} in {ci|remote} ...
==F: Got it.
==G: if they came right straight down.  Okay, you have remote village, then?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, we're laughing.  We're at the start point.
==F: Start point.
==G: Now you don't have anything in ... {fp|uh} below {fp|uh} footbridge? Starting from the start point?
==F: {fp|Uh} okay, there's a banana tree ... below footbridge ... to the left and ... about the same parallel as crest falls.
==G: Okay, banana tree?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, I'll put a tree there. Okay.  Looks realistic now.  Okay, we start from there, we go ... heading south around the top of the falls and down ...
==F: Okay, which side of the falls are we going down?  Left or right?
==G: We're going the left-hand side.
==F: Down the left, okay.
==G: Okay, just slightly turn up, go straight across then, as you hit the bottom of the {le|c} ... in {ci|crest falls} ... just angling off ... and head directly west.  Go underneath ... the banana trees, I guess you said it was?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, once you're about {fp|uh} an inch or so past banana trees, make a big loop coming right back up to footbridge.  Connect right in to cross over the bridge.
==F: Got it.
==G: Got it?
==F: There.  Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now we're going to go in between footbridge and poison stream. So you come off the end of the footbridge, drop about an inch and a half down ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then head directly ... east ... and start turning up just before you get to old temple.  About a quarter of an inch away from old temple ...
==F: So I'm going to run up the left side of old temple?
==G: Left side of old temple.
==F: Got it.
==G: {ab|s} ...
==F: I'm at the top of the old temple.
==G: Okay.  Keep on going up about another two inches ... and then start turning and make a roundabout over ... slate mountain, I guess it is you have yours?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Over the top of slate mountain ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Curve back down ... and go underneath ... the abandoned truck ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You go right to the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned truck}.
==F: Right.  Just a second.
==G: Then ...
==F: Okay, I'm {fp|uh} ... After I come off of slate mountain I'm more or less a flat line underlining the abandoned truck?  To to the {le|a}?
==G: Yeah, you make like a loop going over the top of the mountain ...
==F: Yeah, done.
==G: And ... straight line underneath truck ... abandoned truck ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And stop at the {le|a} ... and then just a little curve and go straight ... south ... for about two inches underneath baboons.
==F: Got it.
==G: You'll curve all the way up and around ... the hill where the baboons are on ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and head straight north on a slight angle towards white mountain. You'll be about a quarter of an inch away from white mountain, following up the side.
==F: Up the left side?
==G: Up the left side of the mountain.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now, let me know when you {ab|g} ...
==F: All right, I'm at the top of the mountain.
==G: You're at the top?  Okay, you must have something above white mountain?
==F: Lemon grove.
==G: Lemon grove?  Is that ... How {ab|f} ... How high from white mountain is it?
==F: {fp|Uh} about three fingers ...
==G: Three {ab|fi} ...
==F: and the left edge of it is directly in line with the highest point of white mountain and it runs about one inch to the right.
==G: One inch to the right, towards cobblestone street?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.
==F: Actually, it ... it's {fp|uh} in line with the word {ci|pyramid} ...
==G: Okay ... Good.  You have to avoid that.  {ph|Bypy} ... Bypass that ... and go over ...
==F: Which way?
==G: over the top of it ...
==F: So I'm going up the left side of it?
==G: Yeah, up the left side of it ...
==F: Okay, {ab|s} now, when I leave the top of white mountain at the point, am I going straight up?
==G: Straight north. Straight north.
==F: Straight north, okay, I'm at the top of lemon grove.
==G: Now.  We'll just make sure where this lemon grove is.  We're almost finished here.
==F: Yeah.
==G: The lemon grove ... is in line, sort of thing, with cobblestone and off to the left of {fp|uh} pyramid, right?
==F: Correct.
==G: Okay.  Once you get above your lemon grove ... hang a {ph|sssharp=sharp} right ... head towards the base of the pyramid about a quarter of an inch up from the base of the pyramid ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then just follow the shape of the pyramid to the top and down the other side.  Going up the left-hand side ...
==F: Got it.  Done.
==G: down the right-hand side ...
==F: Done!
==G: turn around, go underneath pyramid ...
==F: Underneath the word?
==G: Underneath the word {ci|pyramid} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And go out about {fp|uh} an inch ... from the word ... from the {le|p} ... and start {ab|angli} ... Have you got {ph|cobblesko} cobblestone street there?
==F: No, but I've sort of put it in.
==G: Okay, you got to have ... You got to be over about a quarter of an inch past or an inch past the edge of the pyramid ... the left-hand edge.
==F: Yeah.
==G: And start making your way slightly on an angle down to remote village. You have that?
==F: Okay, now am I going ...
==G: You're going south.
==F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled street, I'm going before it?
==G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.
==F: Okay.  All right, got you.
==G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?
==F: All right, so I'm running down sort of the left side of cobbled street?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Angling {ab|i} in, okay, {fp|uh} ...
==G: Just slightly ... You're about an inch ...
==F: All right.
==G: an inch and a half away from white mountain, the {ab|fa} ... the the right-hand edge.
==F: Okay, I'm ...
==G: When you get to the bottom ...

==F: A bite mark in crane bay.
==G: It just sort of curves in, the shore line.
==F: Okay.  So I've {ph|gooone} ... I've come underneath concealed hideout?
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==F: And then how far west do I want to go?
==G: {ab|Ho} ... You want to go two fingers from the {fp|uh} west side of concealed mountain ...
==F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==G: You want to go two fingers out.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then start ... And then go straight down and follow the shore along {ip|til=until} you reach the {fp|uh} furthest point out ...

==G: Okay, {ab|th} go approximately half an inch ... straight across the page ... and put an {le|x}, and that's your ... finish button.
==F: Okay.  Done!
==G: Okay, Brian.  Have you got {fp|uh} burnt forest up in the left-hand corner of your map?
==F: Start's marked, yeah.
==G: {gg|Ah} you got the start point.  Have you got a finish point marked?
==F: No.
==G: Do you have the flagship at the bottom of {ph|thuu=the} map?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Just go inside, inland, about half an inch and ... directly in line with the flagship is an {le|x}.
==F: The ship or the word {ci|flagship}?
==G: The word {ci|flagship}, just go in an inch ...
==F: {ab|Ok} ...
==G: then write {ci|finish} and put an {le|x} above it.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay, let's see if we got everything.  Got burnt forest?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You got ravine?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now, do you have anything off to the left of ravine?
==F: Carpenter's cottage.
==G: Okay, I'll just build that in there.
==F: It's {fp|uh} directly below burnt forest and it's on the same level as {ab|ra} ... as ravine.
==G: Okay. Okay, do you have remote village above the ravine?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  Just go about {fp|uh} an inch and a half above the ravine there, the grassy area, and just mark in remote village because you'll have to go under that.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, do you have pine grove off to the right?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, where you do a little {ph|swiggle} all the way down.  Do you have {fp|uh} concealed hideout?
==F: Yes, and between pine grove and concealed {ab|hi} hideout, I have avalanche.
==G: {fp|Uh}, is that on the right or on the left of pine grove?
==F: It's on the ... right of pine grove, and ... it runs from about the middle of concealed hideout ... off to the ... right and it {ab|s} ... it starts ... {ci|avalanche} the word starts about an inch above concealed {ph|highdrought=hideout} and runs up ... to about an inch below pine grove.  But over to the right side of the page.
==G: Over to the right side?  So it's not directly in line with pine grove and ...?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, do you have anything else there?  {ip|Cause=Because} I got {ph|ziss=this} wild loop here.
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Concealed hideout then boathouse, do you have that?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, then we go down to crane bay, do you have that?
==F: Yes.
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, then you got a loop in crane bay, the first one.  You have a coconut {ph|pon} {ph|pawn} palm?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Uh} flagship, you got?
==F: Yes.
==G: Pebble stone?
==F: Washed stones and ... and pebbled shore.
==G: Pebbled shore?  I don't have washed stones but I got pebbled shore ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You go up above that about {fp|uh} two fingers ... and over ... so that the first ... the trunk of the tree is in line with the {le|e}, two fingers up, and that'll be coconut palm.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Cause=Because} you got to go in between that and pebbled shore. Where's this other one you were talking about?
==F: {fp|Uh}, washed stones ... the word {ci|stone} is in line with the {le|x} for the finish point ...
==G: It's in line ...
==F: and it goes to the left ... and it's about halfway in between ... the ... point by the flagship ...
==G: Okay.
==F: and pebbled shore ... and it is about two fingers ... if you laid ... You see the straight edge of the shoreline there above the flagship?
==G: Yeah.
==F: If you laid two fingers in there that's about your spacing to get washed stones.
==G: {ph|Awwkay=Okay}, we have to go around that ... to get to the {fp|uh} finish point.  Okay, let's start!
==F: Okay.
==G: Burnt forest!
==F: Yeah.
==G: You curve down to your right, slightly, then swing back ... {fp|uh} swing back {fp|uh} west and go around carpenter's cottage ... across the bottom of carpenter's cottage ... slowly swing up and go in between ravine and remote village.  But heading straight ...
==F: Okay, am I going between carpenter's cottage and ravine?
==G: And ravine.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you're on the {fp|uh} left-hand side of carpenter's cottage, or right-hand side of carpenter's cottage, going up.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay?
==F: I'm with you.  I'm right at the top of the ravine right now.
==G: Right across ... Yeah ... Right across to the two little birds there ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: about an eighth of an inch above them and straight ... heading east ... {ip|til=until} you get to the end of the {le|e} in {ci|village}, then angle yourself down to pine grove, so that your line comes right below the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ... then you do two little loops ... one going east ... that's about an inch long, and then you cut back very sharp ... going west, and then cut back very sharp east again to go around concealed hideout.  That's why I asked you if there was something there.
==F: Okay, so I'm going ... east over towards avalanche ...
==G: Yeah, don't get ... Don't touch avalanche and then bend back in going west ... just for a split second then turn back again ... going east and go all the way around concealed hideout.
==F: Okay, am I going under concealed {ph|heimit=hideout} ...
==G: Yeah, over the top ...
==F: Or over the top of it?
==G: on the right-hand side, coming around ... and straight underneath the words {ci|concealed hideout}.
==F: Okay.
==G: You got boathouse?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, go straight in line with the {le|e} in {ci|boathouse} and then straight ... south and follow that bend in the ... in the crane bay ... You see the ... where the shoreline goes?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: The loop?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, just follow the loop around, until you get to the {ab|ne} next little tip there ... and then head straight ... {fp|uh} How you go there? ... southwest staying about {fp|uh} a quarter of an inch to half an inch off the shoreline ... for about three inches.  Now you got coconut palm marked in there now?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You go underneath the word {ci|coconut palm} ... and that's in between pebble stone and coconut palm then ...
==F: Right.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, then you swing way out and ... You got silver creek, there?
==F: No.
==G: Or what was the name of that other place?
==F: Washed stones?
==G: Washed stones?
==F: That's down below pebbled shore ...
==G: You {ab|ke} ... You keep ... You ... Yeah.  You keep on going.  You bypass that on the left-hand side ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and keep on angling yourself towards the ... edge of the {ab|pap} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: But leaving about an inch and a half ... down near washstone ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then cut right back in to the finish line which should be directly in line with the flagship.
==F: Got it.
==G: Got it?
==F: Yeah.
==G: That's her.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Darcy, can you hear me?
==F: Yes I can!
==G: Do you have a start point?
==F: {fg|Er}, {ph|nooooooo=no}.
==G: You don't have a {ab|s} ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, yes I do!  Yes I do!  Yes I do!
==G: Okay.  Is it above a camp?
==F: Missionary camp.  Yeah.
==G: Missionary camp.  Good.  And what I want you to do is, you see the left tent on the missionary {ab|te} {fp|er} ... missionary camp?
==F: Yeah.
==G: See {ph|theee=the} the left point of it?  Like the {ph|lowep=lower} ... lower point of {ph|thee=the} tent?
==F: Yeah.
==G: The furthest-to-the-left part of the tent.  What I want you to is ... do is put a dot, one inch above the lowest part and the furthest part to the left ... of that tent.  Understand?
==F: Lowest part of the tent?  Okay.
==G: Which is ... the furthest to the left of the tent.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Put ... An inch above that ...
==F: Okay.
==G: put a dot.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now connect it from start to the dot. Got it?
==F: Sure.
==G: Do you have gorillas?
==F: Gorillas? No.  Wish I did!  No I don't.
==G: Do you have banana tree?
==F: Banana tree?  Yeah!
==G: Okay.  What I want you to {ab|d} ... You have the word {ci|missionary camp} then, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Put {ph|aaaa=a} dot, about ... an inch and a half away from the word {ci|missionary camp} to the left of it ...
==F: Got you.
==G: on that same level.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now connect it ... {ph|nn} the two dots that you have now.  Got it?
==F: An inch and a half, right?
==G: {ph|Iyyyeah=Yeah}.
==F: Okay.  {fp|Er} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, now what I want you to do ... is go to the left tree ...
==F: Left of the tree?
==G: of your ... Left of the tree, one quarter of an inch, and go down ... to where it says {ci|banana tree} or whatever, right?
==F: Okay.
==G: {ph|Aaand=And} go down about a quarter of an inch, past the word {ci|banana tree} ... or one fifth of an inch past the word {ci|banana tree}.  Got it?
==F: One fifth?  Okay.  Let me get my ruler out. There.  Got it!
==G: Put a point.  Connect the two points.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Now what I want you to ... Do you have a rope bridge?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now is it above ... the trees?
==F: Yes it is.
==G: {ph|Aand=and} a bit to the right, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, what I want you to do is go north ... due north, until you get between the word {ci|rope} and the word {ci|bridge} ... and stop and put a point.  So you're going due north.
==F: Say, where am I right now?  I'm right under {ph|baana=banana} banana tree, right?
==G: {fg|Er}, yeah.  {ab|Bu} ... You should be a little to the left of banana tree.
==F: That's right.
==G: Right.
==F: Okay.
==G: One quarter of an inch.
==F: If I due ... If I go due north, I'll hit right the river.
==G: River?
==F: I'll hit right in the river, yeah.
==G: {fp|Er}, river. River? Okay.  Okay.  All right.
==F: So {fp|er} ... I go due north and I then I go {fp|er} north {fp|er} northeast or something like that?
==G: What I want you to do is ... See ... Shit!
==F: Yeah.
==G: I have gorillas.  Now what I want you to do ... You've got banana trees, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And that's due west of the {ab|s} missionary camp?
==F: {ph|Bllbbll}.  Exactly.
==G: All right. And you went one quarter an inch to the left of that banana tree?
==F: Yes I did.
==G: The furthest-to-the-left banana tree?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then you went down ... about a quarter of an inch ... and you put a point?
==F: True.
==G: And then you connected to the two last points, and now I'm telling you to go due north, and you're going to go right through a river?
==F: Yeah.  {ip|Cause=Because} the rope bridge is ... {fp|er} above and to the right of the banana tree.
==G: Yeah?  So the river should {ph|beee=be} to the right of the banana trees.
==F: Yeah.  But you told me to go to the left of banana tree.
==G: Yeah.  The left of the banana trees.
==F: Okay.  I get you.  Okay.
==G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==F: I'll go right to the rope rope bridge.
==G: No, you want to go due north ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go to the right side of the rope bridge, or you can draw a line right through the rope bridge if you want.
==F: Yeah.
==G: {fg|Erm} ... Go to the right side of the rope bridge and go down ... like, follow, {br|l like=like} {ph|gooo=go} out, a bit, to the right ...
==F: {gg|Hmmph}.
==G: and then go down until you you are parallel with the word {ci|bridge}, and put a point there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now do you have a waterfall?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Well ... You see the steam from the waterfall?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And the waterfall's right beside the rope bridge?
==F: Yeah.
==G: To the right of it, and up?
==F: Yeah.
==G: What I want you to do is, go to the middle of the steam, to the left of it about an inch.  Got me?
==F: Sir!
==G: Put a point, and connect the two last points that I gave you ...
==F: Got you.
==G: Okay.  Now ... {fp|er} ... Shit!  Now, you see where the cliff is, on the ... waterfall?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You see where it ends?  Go over, like, just a little smidge ...
==F: To the right?
==G: To the left ...
==F: Okay.
==G: put a dot ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and from your last two dots, curve it a little bit.  Don't make it a straight line.  Curve the line a bit.
==F: Got you.
==G: Okay.  Now what I want you ... Do you have any lost steps or {ph|staps=steps} or something like that?
==F: Lost steps.  {ph|Waaay=Way} way up, about {fp|er} ...
==G: Okay.  No, no.  {ab|I} I got different lost steps.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so what ... All right.  And then you have fallen pillars, right?
==F: {fp|Er}, right in the centre of the page.
==G: Yeah.  Okay.  Now, what I'm going to give you is an obstacle right beside fallen pillars, and you're going to have to go up ... So what I want you to do is go north from your last point ... until you are right in line ... with ... the middle of those pillars ...
==F: Got you.
==G: Not the middle of the word.  The middle of pillars.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Put a point ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and go up about a quarter of an inch ... but don't make a point ... and go left about a half an inch, and make a point. Got me?
==F: Got you.
==G: So {ab|n} ... And then curve that line from the two points you've got.
==F: Up or down curve?
==G: Up curve. {ab|S} ... Up and to the left curve, right?
==F: Got you.
==G: Now what I want you to do ... is {fp|er} ... Do you see the word {ci|pillars}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, what I want you to do ... is {fp|er} go down ... {ab|f} ... See the {le|s} on {ci|pillars}?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Go down {br|f from=from} there ... about {fp|er} half an inch, and put a point ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and go from your last point ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and {ph|cuuuuuuurve=curve} downwards, towards that ... point I just gave you.
==F: Got you.
==G: Okay. Now, you see the leftmost blade of grass {ab|o} {ab|bet} on the fallen pillars ... thing?
==F: Yeah
==G: Go down an inch and a half from there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: put a point ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and join those two points I just gave you.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now, do you have something ... {fp|er} southwest of the fallen pillars?  Something like {fp|er} flamingoes?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do {ph|iiis=is} curve around those flamingoes ... and head ...
==F: Downward or upwards?
==G: Downwards.  Around it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Right?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: To save time and ... go north northeast of there.  {fp|Er}, do you have ancient ruins?
==F: Yeah.  Ruined city.  Same thing.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is curve up.  You'll see three birds. What I want you to is curve up as if you were going towards that top bird ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: But you're still staying about a quarter of an inch, almost a half an inch away from that bird.
==F: Sure.
==G: So you're pointing ... So you're going up sort of almost like a triangle, kind of ... pointing inwards ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: to the middle of the page.  Now ... Put a point.  Now, what I want you to do is ... Do you have stones?
==F: {fp|Er} ... No.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to {ph|ss} ... the stones I have are {ab|dir} due north of me ... but what I ...
==F: Okay.  Yeah, rock fall.  Same thing.
==G: {ab|R} ... Okay, yeah. What I want you to do is go ... make a point {ab|r} about a half an inch to the right of the {ab|w} second {le|s} in the word {ci|stones}.
==F: I haven't got the word {ci|stones}.
==G: Or {ci|falls}, or whatever.
==F: {ci|Fall}, okay.  How how far away?
==G: {fp|Er}, {ab|ab} actually about ... a fifth of an inch, we'll say.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Actually, what's the word you have?
==F: {ci|Rock fall}.
==G: Rock {ab|fa}?  Okay, {ab|g} ... just go {ab|st} ... right to the {le|l} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and put a point right beside the {le|l}.
==F: Yeah.
==G: And what I want you to do now is, you have the ... Do you have the white mountain?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, you see the word {ci|white mountain}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to draw a line going towards that word, just a bit above that word ... but I want you to stop ... about half an inch southwest of the {fp|erm} ... the bottom part ... the left bottom part of the mountain.
==F: Southwest, okay.  So I'm going up around the ruined city, make a point at that rock fall ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go to the rock fall, just a minute.  I'm at the rock fall.  And at the southwest tip ... of white mountain.
==G: Southwest tip of {fp|er} {ab|th} white mountain, you should be a half an inch ... southwest of there.
==F: Okay.  Just a minute now ... {ph|Tssssssccchh}.  Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now what I want you to do is {br|go o=go} go {fp|er} ... You're going to stay a quarter of an inch away from the mountain at all times ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah?
==G: as you're going straight up to the peak ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Go right up to the peak ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ab|S} ... Continue staying at about a quarter of an inch or almost a half an inch away ... from the mountain as you're going down the other side of that mountain ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you {ph|ter=to} ... {fp|erm} ... curve ... {ph|dooooown=down} ... {gg|Oh}, this is hard to say. Do you have a {ab|b} a big furniture store or something?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  You have gazelles, though, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do ... is come down from the {ph|woooooord=word} ... or from the letter {le|w}.  See the {ab|wo} letter {le|w}?
==F: {ab|Ye} ...
==G: In {ci|white mountain}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to ... Make a point there ... and I want you to curve from where you stopped writing last ... downwards, about an inch from the {le|w}.  Got me?
==F: Got you.
==G: It's kind of {fp|er} confusing.  Now what I want you to do is come out ... an inch to the left of there, like, due west of there ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: put a point, join the two ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Now I want you to go due south ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: curve around the gazelles ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You're staying about a half an inch away from the gazelles ...
==F: Got you.
==G: {ph|aaaand=and} you're going about ... two inches to the right ... of the gazelles ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Stop.  Finish.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Kim, you ready there?
==F: Sure am.
==G: You got a diamond mine?
==F: Yes.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have the start position?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: What I want you to do is I want you to loop down on the left-hand side of the diamond mine {ip|til=until} you're underneath it.
==F: {ip|Til=Until} {ab|r} ... I'm under the word {ci|diamond {ph|mind=mine}}?
==G: Correct.
==F: Under the {le|d}?
==G: Under {ph|thuuh=the} second {le|d} in {ci|diamond {ph|mind=mine}}.
==F: Excellent!  I'm there!
==G: Do you have a wagon wheel? To the right of your diamond mine?
==F: No.  I have a cactus ... to ...
==G: Where's that?
==F: It is in the upper ... right-hand corner of my map ...
==G: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==F: below rift valley.
==G: Okay, I do not have that.  Is it directly below rift valley?
==F: Yes!
==G: Is it to the left or to the right of ... the word {ci|rift valley}.
==F: To the left.
==G: To the left?  {ab|H} like an inch over roughly?
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now, this is what {ph|hmph} we have to do.  It's about three inches ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: from your diamond mine to its right is the wagon wheel?
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.  So I have to avoid it?
==G: Right.  Now {br|y you=you} have to proceed on a northeast east direction?
==F: Okay, definitely.
==G: For about three inches.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Got that?
==F: Okay, but {ab|av} ...
==G: Maybe three and a half.
==F: But avoid this wagon wheel.
==G: Pointed ... You should be going almost toward rift valley.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: So go now?
==G: Yes.  So go for three inches, and then stop.
==F: I'm stopped.
==G: Okay.  Now I want you to do a little ... jaunt up ... north ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and a little bit of a curve in towards the west.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: {fg|Oh}, into the west.
==G: Do you understand what I'm saying?  So ...
==F: Into the west?
==G: Yeah.  So just like a curve around where the wagon wheel would be. Just a little bit.  Not ... Like, just {ip|til=until} you'd be at the top of it.  Do not go completely around.  Do you understand?
==F: Yes, I do.
==G: Just go {ip|til=until} you're at the side of it.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now I want you to {br|pro ceed=proceed} north for about an inch.  You should almost be level with your start position.  On the ... horizontally.
==F: Yeah, I'm there.
==G: Okay?  Understand?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now!  We're going to go right.  Right into the middle of rift valley. See that ... how there's trees or cactuses on each side of it?
==F: Yes.
==G: See in the middle where there's that gravel?
==F: Yeah.  Do I come ...
==G: That path?
==F: over the trees into the gravel?
==G: Yes.  You go over and then through right in the middle of the gravel.
==F: Okay and ...
==G: And ...
==F: And stop at the word {ci|rift}?  Like just to ...
==G: Yeah, right by where the {le|r} is.
==F: Over to the left of it?  Okay, I'm stopped there.
==G: Okay.  It should be about the same size as a pop can, that ...
==F: Yeah!
==G: Okay.  Now what I want you to do ...
==F: That's neat!
==G: is go south for about two inches.
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have rocks?
==F: Yeah!
==G: About an inch over the rocks, stop.  Over the big rock middle of it.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a stone creek?
==F: No.
==G: Do you have white water?
==F: I have rapids?
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Your white water is your rapids.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... See where the end of your {ci|rapids} is written?
==F: {fg|Oh}, I have a swamp.  I ... I should tell you.
==G: Okay, where is that located?
==F: It is northwest of my rapids.
==G: Northwest?  Yes, I see that.
==F: Okay.  {ph|S} that's ...
==G: Now what I want you to do is I want you to go down on a southwest direction ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: for about {ab|th} three inches.  You should be ...
==F: {fg|Oh} ... Where will I end up?
==G: About ... an inch and a half over from your white water ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  And ...
==F: And that's where I'll be?
==G: And you'll be down just sightly into the picture of the white water, roughly.  There's a stone creek right there that you're trying to avoid.  So you ... The stone creek protrudes a little bit down south of the white water.  Do you understand?
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah.
==G: Like of the rapids? {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Are you down at the bottom point now? ...
==F: No, no, I ... I'm not there yet {ip|cause=because} I want to know, do I loop around the rocks?
==G: Okay ...
==F: Like, or do I {ph|cu} hug the side of the rocks?
==G: All I do ... Just go straight from the {ab|poi} ... last point I gave you ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: to the point almost equal with your rapids.  On a southwest heading.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you should be about an inch and a half away from the white {ab|wa} ... like, the rapids at this point.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what I want you to do is I want you to do a {ab|bi} ... Do you have an outlaws' {br|ha ideout=hideout}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything underneath the white water?
==F: Yeah, a manned fort.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  How far is that underneath the white water?  Roughly?
==F: Three inches?
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do now, is I want you to make a big {le|c}.
==F: {br|O okay=Okay}.
==G: Now with that {le|c} I want you to go all the way round the white water on to its west hand side.  I want you to keep on the west and then the {br|s outh=south} edge of your {fp|uh} thing that you gave me but three inches below the white water.  Do you understand?
==F: {fg|Oh}, yeah okay, so ...
==G: A big {le|c}, just a big {le|c} ...
==F: Am I going around my rapids and around my manned fort?
==G: Yes.
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.
==G: And you're staying on the left of both of them.
==F: Okay.
==G: And you'll end up at the {br|b bottom=bottom} of your {fp|uh} ...
==F: Manned fort.
==G: Your manned fort.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, see your outlaws' hideout?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}!
==G: I want you to aim straight for the {le|o}.  Draw a straight line ... between there and the {le|o}.
==F: There.
==G: You should be pretty close.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, do you have a noose down on the right ... hand ... corner bottom edge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {ab|s} a pond?  Or something resembling a pond in the ... bottom right-hand area?
==F: No. ... I have ... under my outlaws' hideout I have a gold mine ...
==G: Okay.
==F: and under that I have a noose.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have anything to the west of that?  Of the noose?
==F: Yeah.  Stone slabs.
==G: Okay, that's up high ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have a stone creek?
==F: I ... yes I do!
==G: Do you have a saloon bar?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  For now what I ...
==F: And that's all I've got.
==G: Okay, for now what I want you to do is measure off about an inch and a half ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: west of your noose, and an inch and a half down from your noose.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
==G: Just put a {br|l ittle=little} dot there, okay?
==F: Let me think.  {br|I inch=Inch} and a half over and inch and a half down, okay.  There's a little dot there.
==G: It should be ... right underneath your stone slabs but down about three inches from that.
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  What I want you to do now is I want you to {fp|er} a ... big reverse {le|c} from your outlaws' hideout to that point I just gave you.
==F: Okay.  I got it.  Am I going around my gold mine and around my noose?
==G: Yes.
==F: And I'm ...
==G: Towards the east side of it.
==F: {ab|T} ...
==G: Right towards the edge of the paper.
==F: Right.  And I'm ...
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: going over outlaws' hideout to get there?
==G: Over {fp|uh} ... No, you're going under the outlaws' hideout.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: Okay, I'm doing it now.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, are you there?
==F: {ab|Ok} ... {gg|Mmhmm}, I am!
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, what we have to do now is we have to go {br|o over=over} top of what's called swan pond.  It's about the same as that pop can up at the top.
==F: Okay.
==G: What I want you to do now is measure off about ... two and a half inches to the immediate west of that.
==F: There.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Pretend there's a pop can in the way and do a gradual curve over top ...
==F: {fp|Oh}, so I'm ...
==G: As though there's {ab|somethi} ...
==F: going in a northwest fashion?
==G: Yes, northwest and then gradually going ... south ...
==F: {ab|We} ...
==G: west.
==F: Yeah, okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Understand?
==F: Done.
==G: You done that?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now, you have your saloon bar?
==F: Yeah!
==G: See the top roof of the saloon bar?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Follow that an inch and a half to its left, towards the west.
==F: Okay.
==G: Draw a big {le|x} there, that's your finish.
==F: Excellent!
==G: Now what I want you to do, is take that last point I gave you?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then go underneath the saloon bar in a gradual curve about the size of {ph|aaaah=a} jar of peanut butter.  Understand that angle?
==F: Say it to me again.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
==F: That last point I'm at ...
==G: {ab|Th} ... I've given you two points.
==F: Okay.
==G: The other side of the swamp {fp|uh} ... the swan pond ...
==F: yeah.
==G: And the finish point.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Go underneath your saloon bar in a gradual curve.
==F: {fg|Oh}, Okay.
==G: Keeping close to the saloon bar when you go under it.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Understand?
==F: Yeah.  Done.
==G: {br|A and=And} that's it, then.
==G: {ph|Okaaay=Okay}, we start at the bottom of the map ...

==G: Now I want you to go due north from that point, two and a half iches ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And now you should be the standard distance away from the east lake. You should be standard distance away from the coast of east lake in line with that last {le|e} in in the word {ci|lake}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now, I want you to curve southwest almost due west but I want you to hug that that coastline, standard distance, and I want you to go past that peak, the first peak you would get if you were walking {fp|uh} west ...
==F: Got you.
==G: I want you to go half an inch ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ph|Sststandard=standard} width away and I want you to stop.  So you should about an inch away from that tip of the east lake.
==F: Got you.
==G: You're done.
==G: Okay, Kim.  You ready?
==F: Yes!
==G: Okay.  Do you have a crest falls?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a start position on there, of course?
==F: Right above it, yes.
==G: What I want you to do ... is I want you to go ... west about an inch, and then down about two inches, until you're level with crest falls. Do a gradual curve out, so you should be about an inch out from {ph|theee=the} actual sea.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a footbridge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Do you have anything in that ... in between crest falls and the footbridge, and down towards {ph|thee=the} south?
==F: {fg|Er}, a banana tree off to the side.
==G: How far is that over from your crest falls? ... Five inches?
==F: <event desc="makes ttt sound by sucking against alveolar region, but it is not meant to indicate irritation or anything of that sort"> Six.
==G: Six inches area?  And it's level with the crest falls?
==F: Yes it is.
==G: Okay.  What we have to do now ... Do you have anything up by the footbridge ... to the left of it?  Directly to the left of it?  Or ...
==F: To the left, nothing.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What we're going to do is ... we're going to go ... west ... until you're on the other side of your banana tree or whatever it is ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: So, {br|u underneath=underneath} the banana tree?
==G: Right.  Just stop when you're underneath it.
==F: Okay. ... I'm underneath it.
==G: Now we're going to do a big {le|c} up, right onto the footbridge.
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.  Too easy.
==G: Now do you have a poisoned stream on the other side of your footbridge?
==F: No!
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}!
==F: I have an old temple ... above crest falls and {ab|ju} ...
==G: Okay.  But the ... {br|foot bridge=footbridge} with the poisoned stream is right ... beside the footbridge.
==F: Okay.  I don't have it.
==G: What you have {br|t o=to} do ... You're up to the footbridge now?
==F: Yes.
==G: On the east hand side of the footbridge ...
==F: Okay.
==G: go south ... one inch.
==F: So go over the footbridge and then south one inch?
==G: Directly south one inch.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Now what I want you to do is ... two inches ... east.
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have something directly above that point?  Level with your abandoned truck?
==F: Slate mountain.
==G: Right. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what I want you to do ... is we're going to do a reverse {le|c} this time, and you're going to end up right at the point of that slave mountain or whatever.
==F: Right at the tip?
==G: Right at the tip of it ...
==F: {fg|Oh}.
==G: underneath that remote {ph|villach=village}, by about an inch and a half.
==F: All right!
==G: Do you understand?
==F: I'm ... heading there now.
==G: Now ... You will ... You are staying on the west hand side of the old temple ...
==F: {fg|Oh} yeah!  That's right.
==G: So don't ... So don't go over {ph|tho=to} the old temple ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Just go up to it, and do a reverse {le|c} around to it ... and stop when you're there.
==F: {ph|Aaand=And} I'm there.
==G: Okay.  You have the abandoned truck?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Head southwest until you ... almost meet the {le|k} in the {ci|truck}. Do you understand?
==F: Yeah, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Bout=About} two and a half inches.  Now, go two inches west ... You should be at the other end of it, almost where the {le|a} is ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Do you have baboons or anything like that ... {br|imme diately=immediately} to your southwest?
==F: I have nothing immediately to my south west.
==G: Okay, what I want you to do now, is go down, an inch and a half ... south ...
==F: Okay.
==G: from that point.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Just put a dot there.
==F: Okay.
==G: And from there, an inch and a half ... west.  Put another dot there.
==F: Okay.
==G: An inch and a half up, and put another dot there.  You should have almost like {ph|aaa=a} square box there.
==F: Yeah!
==G: Now what I want you to do is do a loose, flowing {le|u} through that. Do you understand?
==F: {ph|Yeeees=Yes}!
==G: And ... it'll look like a {le|u}.
==F: {fp|Uh}, it's done.
==G: Okay.  Now, you have white mountain on your map?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: See the {ab|summi} ...
==F: Directly {fp|er} north of this abandoned truck.
==G: Right.  {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do is just mark a dot ... about ... half an inch off the top of white mountain's summit ...
==F: Okay.
==G: a little bit towards the northwest.
==F: Okay.  Done.
==G: Now.  Connect those two points, where you start with that {le|u} ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: and there ... and go ... along ... the side of the mountain when you get close to it.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  You there?
==F: Done.  Done, yeah.
==G: Now I want you to go two inches ... north ... and you should be ... level with the pyramid ... sand.  You have a pyramid on your map at the top?
==F: Yeah.  I have a lemon grove in my way though.
==G: {ab|T} ...
==F: Do you want me to go to the left of it?
==G: {fg|Erm} ...
==F: Or to the right of it?
==G: you should be able to just avoid it.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|I} ...
==F: {ab|I} ...
==G: And that would probably be to {ph|thee=the} left ... Like it's right above white mountain, I presume, correct?
==F: It is.
==G: Okay, go up to the top left-hand corner of there.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Now ... See how the pyramid is shaped?
==F: Yes.
==G: I want you to draw a line until you're about half an inch nearer the pyramid.  Like {ph|aaa=a} east line until you're half an inch away from the pyramid. {br|A at=At} that point you will stay around ... half an inch around the entire pyramid ... and then go underneath the words, like you'll have to give it a bit more room for around the words. Do you understand?
==F: Yes.
==G: So make a big pyramid around it.  And stop when you're right underneath {ph|thee=the} word {ci|pyramid}.
==F: {ab|Oka} ...
==G: Are you there?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a cobbled street?
==F: Wait!  Did I go over the {ab|m} ... over the pyramid to do this?
==G: Yes you did.
==F: {gg|Ah}!
==G: Over.
==F: Okay, I'm not there yet.
==G: Okay.  So you went in {ph|aaa=a} ... northeast direction? ... And then you went in {ph|aaa=a} ...
==F: There.  I'm ... I'm there now.
==G: southeast direction?  And then in ... almost like a west direction?
==F: Okay.
==G: Should be a loop around. ... Now, do you have a cobbled street below this?
==F: No.
==G: Do you have a remote village?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
==F: I have ...
==G: Yes?
==F: a poisoned stream.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, that's not ...
==F: {br|I ignore=Ignore} it?
==G: anything to do with our map.
==F: {br|O okay=Okay}.  I have this remote village.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Right above the remote village is a cobbled street.
==F: Okay.
==G: So what we're going to have to do here is another one of those fancy {le|c}'s.  But this one is ... sharp at the top.
==F: Okay.
==G: So go an inch ... west, and stop ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and now do a curved {le|c} ... just a slight curve, not {ph|aaa=a}
==F: Am I doing a ...
==G: winding curve ... and underneath ...
==F: a frontwards {le|c} or a backward {le|c}?
==G: A normal {le|c} that you'll end up underneath the remote village.
==F: A normal {le|c}.  Okay. Done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Are you underneath the remote village?
==F: Yes I am.
==G: Right underneath ... the {le|v} in {ci|village} ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: You have to go about an inch and a half past that ... towards the east ... and you will hit a finish point ... if you don't have that {ab|m} labelled on your map.
==F: I don't, {ph|aaand=and} I'm done!
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}!  There you go!
==F: Okay.
==G: Ready?  You got a start point?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Right beside a burnt forest?
==F: Yeah.
==G: All right.  See the {le|b} in {ci|burnt forest}?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Draw a line from {ci|start} to {le|b}.  Standard distance away from the {le|b}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have something below the burnt forest?
==F: Carpenter's cottage.
==G: I want you to curve around it.  Do you have a ravine?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to go above the ravine ... so you're curving underneath whatever you just told me ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: going standard distance above those birds ...
==F: So you want me to go under the carpenter's cottage or over?
==G: Under.
==F: Okay.  Got you.
==G: {ab|Ha} ...
==F: And in between the ravine there?
==G: In between the ravine and the remote village.  Do you have a remote village?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is stay ... just a bit above standard ... {fp|er} distance above those birds ...
==F: Birds?
==G: {br|O of=Of} ... in the ravine ...
==F: Birds.
==G: Two ... birds.
==F: Okay.  Above them?
==G: Above them.
==F: Okay.
==G: Just a bit above standard.  Now what I want you to do is ... Do you have a pine grove?
==F: Yeah.
==G: See those ... the top of the trees?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Go over about two inches ... from the top of the trees ...
==F: {ab|O} ... Okay.
==G: put a point ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: connect those two points that I just ... gave you ...
==F: Okay.  I'm over top of the pine grove.
==G: {fp|Er} you shouldn't be.
==F: {gg|Uh-oh}.
==G: Two inches ... left of the ... pine grove ... make a point.
==F: Okay.
==G: At the height of the {fp|er} top of the trees.
==F: Got you.
==G: Now connect the points from above the birds to ... that point I just gave you.
==F: Okay.  Got you.
==G: Now.  See the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to make a point ... {fp|er} just a bit left of the {le|p} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: standard distance away ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: from the bottom of the {le|p}, {ph|aaand=and} join those last two points.  Do you have something ... just a bit southwest of pine grove?
==F: Southwest?  Yeah, I got a ... {ab|till=tilled} ...
==G: Like almost ... right underneath, but ... just a bit to the left.
==F: Of pine {ph|grovevv=grove}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {fp|Er}, nothing ... immediately ... southwest, no.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do ... Do you have anything southeast of there?
==F: Southeast?  {gg|Oh}.
==G: Like a cavern or something ...
==F: Avalanche.
==G: Avalanche.  That's what I {ab|wa} {ab|remem} ... I've seen this before. {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do is do the same thing you did last time.
==F: {gg|Oh}, okay.  I remember that.
==G: Remember that?  That backward {le|c} ... turning into a {le|c}?
==F: {fp|Er}, going which direction?
==G: Okay, so you get the backward {le|c} ... curving ... southwest ... so it starts ... Fuck! It starts ... from the {le|p} ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: {ph|Aaaand=And} it should curve ... to your right ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and end up ... underneath the {le|g} ... in {ci|pine grove}.  But you should be about three inches down.  Two and a half inches down.
==F: I'm doing a backward {le|c} here, right?
==G: Backward {le|c}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now, do you have a concealed hideout?
==F: Yeah.
==G: I want you to go round there.  Do you have a boat house?  Not the one on the bottom but the one in the middle of the page.
==F: Go around there, on the outside?
==G: On the outside of it to the right, yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Standard distance away, blah blah blah.
==F: Yeah, yeah.
==G: Do you have a boat house?
==F: Yeah.
==G: But not on the {ab|bott} {ab|n} ... Like in the middle {ph|ssort=sort} of the page?
==F: No.  I got it right beside crane bay.
==G: All right.
==F: Out of the way.
==G: Do you remember where the boat house was last time?
==F: {fp|Er}. No but I know ... I know where you're going.
==G: Okay.  Go an ... a half an {ab|i} ... or three-quarters of an inch away from the {ci|concealed} part of {ci|concealed hideout}.  Like, from the {le|c} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: staying on that line, put a point, and go due ... south ...
==F: Fuck!
==G: until you're into that little ... bit of a curve ... of the {ab|coco=coconut} of the {br|c crane=crane} bay ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: follow the curve up to that one point, curve down.  Now, there's going to be a coconut palm there.  Do {ab|yo} ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I got {fp|er} pebbled shore and washed stones.
==G: Okay.  What I want you to do is ... go ... Where's the washed stones? To the left of pebbled shore?
==F: No.  Just {fp|er} directly {fp|er} beneath it.
==G: Okay.  Well, don't worry about that then.  {fp|Erm} ... I want you to come {ph|mum mum mum uh} ... You don't have that.  Fuck!  {fp|Erm} ... Fuck!  I want you to ... go above pebbled shore ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: from {fp|er} ... that lip ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and I want you to come down ... underneath whatever you just told me that you had ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And ... that's where you finish.  About {ph|aaaan=an} inch and a half away from the flagship, the bottom of the flagship.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Got me?
==F: Got you.
==G: Done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Kim.  Ready?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Seen your parked van?  Like, you have a start over top of your camera shop, correct?
==F: {fp|Er}, yes I do.
==G: See your parked van?
==F: My parked van is at the very top north ...
==G: {fp|Er}, is there another parked van ...
==F: No there is not.
==G: down south of the camera shop?
==F: {fg|Oh} no.  I have a little ... area called {ci|allotments} ...
==G: Okay.
==F: to {ph|sss} the southeast of my camera shop ...
==G: Now ... Now, what I want you to do is go down ... {ip|bout=about} {ab|thr} ... {fg|mm} two and a half inches, down from your camera shop ...
==F: {ab|R} ...
==G: at the bottom of the letters ... two and a half inches {ab|dow} ...
==F: Am I going on the left side or the right?
==G: Just ... put a dot for now.
==F: {fg|Oh}, a dot, okay.
==G: Right in the middle where the {le|a} is, two and a half down from the bottom of that {le|a}.  You should be about ...
==F: I'm ...
==G: an equal distance in between there and the border.  Between the camera shop and the border.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: Okay!
==G: Look roughly good to you?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now, what we're going to do is we got to ...
==F: Wait!  {br|I is=is} my dot ... Can you give me ... it in reference to the allotments?
==G: It it will be on a {ab|sou} ... Okay.  At your dot looking up, it's northeast to your allotments.
==F: {fg|Oh} okay.
==G: It's directly underneath the {le|a} in {ci|camera shop}, the middle {le|a} ...
==F: I know, but I just didn't go down far enough.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Now, I want you to do is one of our famous ... stringy {le|c}'s ...
==F: {gg|Ah}, I can ...
==G: until you get there.
==F: I can do a stringy {le|c}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Got it?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Done?
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, go up to your allotments ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: about ... {fp|erm} ... a smidgen ... over top of the allotments, of that one barn that's on the ... left-hand corner, put another dot.
==F: Am I going straight ... or kind of curved up there?
==G: {br|Y you're=You're} curving up there but I'm just telling you to put a dot there for now ... and I want you to go roughly an inch out and put another little ... semi-dot ...
==F: An inch out in what direction?
==G: From your parked van.  Like from that last dot I gave you, like, the first dot I gave you.
==F: Right.
==G: An inch out ... and I want you to do a gradual ... it'll almost look like a {le|j} curve ...
==F: Okay.
==G: up to that ... point.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Criss-crossing through that other point so you don't ... hit the van.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Are you there?
==F: Yeah, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  It should kinda look like a {le|g} now . Now ...
==F: Sort of.
==G: you're going to head in a {br|north east=northeast} east direction. That's right in between northeast and ...
==F: Yes, I knew that.
==G: east.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, and you're going to go about six inches, or right underneath the abandoned monastery, but down ... about ... four inches from there.
==F: Is it halfway between the abandoned monastery and the flight museum?
==G: {fg|Erm} ... halfway in between ... the monastery and the bottom of the yacht club.
==F: {fg|Oh}!
==G: So that'd probably be right beside it.
==F: It is right beside it.
==G: Okay.
==F: Now, from allotments to there, I'm going in ...
==G: a northeast east direction ...
==F: northeast east ...
==G: to those two points ...
==F: Okay.
==G: like just to that one point, and stop there.
==F: I'm {ab|th} ... I'm there.
==G: Now ... see ... You have your abandoned monastery?
==F: Yes.
==G: I want you to just do a gradual curve over top of that and stop at the beginning of it.  You know, where the {le|a} is.  So you're going ...
==F: Is it {ab|i} ...
==G: north ...
==F: Yes.
==G: and then turning west and then coming down southwest and then stopping right by the {le|a}.
==F: I'm going north ... then west ...
==G: Right, you're going up ...
==F: Yes?
==G: and {br|ar round=around} ... the abandoned monastery ... counterclockwise.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, are you there?
==F: No, I haven't {ab|e} ... I'm {ab|ju} ... Okay, I'm going up north towards the abandoned monastery ...
==G: Keep on going until you are around the {br|ab bandoned=abandoned} monastery.
==F: And then I go west?
==G: Like up that five inches ...
==F: Then I go {ab|wes} ...
==G: Just go ...
==F: {ph|A} ...
==G: loop around the abandoned monastery ...
==F: Loop ...
==G: and stop at the {le|a}.
==F: In {ci|monastery}?
==G: No.  The first {le|a} ...
==F: {fg|Oh}!
==G: {ci|abandoned}.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you should ... {ph|of=have} already looped over top of it?
==F: Yes.
==G: So ... the north face is all covered with a loop?
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Now ... this is kind of tricky.  Do you have an alpine garden?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Do you have anything below your alpine garden?
==F: West lake.
==G: Okay.  That's ... off past where we're going.  Do you have anything in between ... alpha garden and the abandoned monastery?
==F: No I don't.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, well there's nothing here but we have to do a curve ...
==F: Okay.
==G: a bit bigger than a pop can ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then ... you'll go straight up the side of ...
==F: Left side?
==G: {ab|alp} ... Yes.
==F: Okay.
==G: The left-hand side of alpine garden, and stop ... right at the top of alpine garden.
==F: Okay, I can do that.
==G: So, it's kind of like a {le|c} on its side almost ...
==F: Done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now what we're going to do, is we're doing a reverse ... Do you have a youth hostel?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, well go over ... about an ... inch and a bit ... until you're on the other side of your alpine garden.  So you ... at the northeast corner of it.  Do you understand?
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now ... Connect that line.
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: And now go north two inches.
==F: There.
==G: Now, go over ... east ... one inch.
==F: There.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, now we're going to be going in a southeast direction. Do you have a telephone box?
==F: Yes.
==G: Right to that {le|t}.  Just go straight to that {le|t}.  Nice straight line.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, now do a ... kind of like an underline ... of {ci|telephone box} ...
==F: Right.
==G: and stop at the {le|x} in {ci|box}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What I want you to do now ... Do you have {ph|thratched=thatched} mud hut?
==F: No.  Directly ... northwest of this ... telephone box I have level crossing.
==G: Okay, that's ... that's out of the way.
==F: I have no thatched anything.
==G: Okay.  Basically, above the telephone box ...
==F: Okay.
==G: about two inches is a thatched, mud hut.
==F: Okay.
==G: So, what you're going to have to do ... is we're going up on the right-hand side ...
==F: Okay.
==G: So get to the top of the telephone box ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: like, on the top right, the northeast corner ...
==F: Yes.
==G: and then angle in a northwest direction ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.
==G: {ab|graduall} ... and do one of those {le|s} kind of curves ... and ...
==F: Okay, where will I end up?
==G: where I want you to end up ... This is where I want you to end up. ... is about a quarter of an inch away ... from east lake ... but in between those two points.  See the one that's the southernmost point?
==F: Yes.
==G: See the one that's ... closest to your alpine garden? The one that's pointing to it?
==F: Yes.
==G: You should be aiming right for the middle of there.
==F: {ph|S} ... {gg|Uh-oh}.
==G: Stop about ... {ph|quarterrr=quarter} to half an inch out.  {ip|Kay=Okay}?
==F: {fp|Uh}, Okay.
==G: Right.  Pretend there's an object in the way you have to get around.
==F: Done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now your finish ... is about half an inch ... towards your alpine garden from that east lake point.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  From that ... one that's directly {ab|bet} ... the closest one to alpine garden.
==F: Right.
==G: That point.
==F: So make my way there ...
==G: So ...
==F: and then ...
==G: And just follow that along ... Like you'll have to go along the lake shore for ... about two inches.
==F: Right.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  That's it.
==F: And then when I'm there, how far do I go over?
==G: And ... just about half an inch.
==F: Okay I'm there.
==G: Is there any ... part you want to go over quickly {ab|be} while we still have some time?
==F: {fg|Er}, no.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} ... start point is {fp|uh} ... {fg|Uh} do you have start point marked?
==F: What's that?
==G: Do you ... Do you have start point marked?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} it's right ... {fp|uh} beside the ... burnt forest, isn't it?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} go to the {le|b} as for {fp|uh} ...
==F: Seen.
==G: {ci|burnt} ... {ci|burnt forest}.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Make {fg|eh} {ph|aaa=a} small curve ... and then go south ... for about an inch ...
==F: Yeah.

==F: Do you have a {ab|pi} ... a pine grove?  On the right.
==G: Yes.  Yes I do.  So you are {fp|uh} parallel with the top of the trees in pine grove.
==F: Yes, you want me to go straight over there?
==G: {fp|Uh} yes, go {ph|overd=over} there.  Stop about {fp|uh} half an inch from {fp|uh} ... the top of the last tree.
==F: On the right or left?
==G: {fp|Uh} on {ph|thuuu=the} ... left.
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Uh} then go down ... to the {le|p} ...
==F: Seen, done.
==G: {fp|Uh} ... Then {fp|uh} ... make a curve but don't go past {fp|uh} {le|e}, going down.  Make a curve going down but don't {fp|uh} go more to the right with the curve {fp|uh} than the letter {le|e} in {ci|grove} ... Okay?
==F: Okay.  You mean pine grove?
==G: Yes.
==F: I went on the left-hand side of the trees.

==F: Yes.
==G: {fp|Uh} go now an inch to the west ...
==F: Seen.
==G: Then go {fp|uh} {br|south west=southwest} to the {ab|r} ... left of the pebbled shore.  Right beside it.
==F: You want me to go on the left of it?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And ...
==G: Past letter {le|p} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then continue {br|south west=southwest} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: for about an inch ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Then {fp|uh} go {fp|uh} south for about an inch ... make a slight curve at the end and turn ... {fp|uh} ... turn to the {fp|uh} ... east ...
==F: Do you got the flagship there?
==G: Yes I do.  And stop about half an inch from the ... {fp|uh} {fp|uh} from the flagship.
==F: Seen, stopped.
==G: Okay, make a cross there, finish line.
==F: Done.
==G: Okay.
==F: Done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Adam, your start point is right above the missionary camp.  You see that?
==F: Yes.  Got that.
==G: Okay.  To the {fp|er} ... To the left of the missionary camp, about {fp|er} three inches, directly left, the {fp|er} ... there's a group of gorillas?
==F: Okay, I don't have that.  I have a banana tree.
==G: Okay, that's right against the missionary camp?
==F: No.  My banana tree is {fp|er} to the left ... at nine o'clock, at about {ph|pfth} four inches.
==G: Okay.  Looks like what we want to do {ph|isss=is} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you start out, you go {fp|er} west ... and as soon as you reach the end part of the picture of the missionary camp ...
==F: Yes.
==G: where the picture ends ...
==F: Yes.
==G: you go {ph|awwn=on} a ... south ... trajectory, but you're still going west a bit ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: so it looks like you're going under the {fp|er} ... banana trees, okay?  Now ... do you have a rope bridge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  At about {fp|er} ... seven o'clock ... {fp|er} ... {ip|bout=about} inch an a half away, there's {fp|er} gorillas.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, from the rope bridge seven o'clock ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: inch and a half away there's gorillas?  Okay.
==G: Okay.
==F: Right where the river bends there?
==G: Sorry?
==F: The rope bridge, seven o'clock ... Okay.
==G: Okay.  So what we're going to do is ... Okay, {ab|y} you go down, you go underneath the little thing, the banana trees, you keep on going west ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: until {fp|er} ... {ip|til=until} you reach ... you reach the gorillas. Now you want to ... You want to stay on the left-hand side of the gorillas.
==F: The {ab|gori} ... Okay, the gorillas are just an inch and a {ab|ha} ... So ... You know the river?  Do you have a straight river?
==G: No I don't.
==F: {gg|Oh}, okay.  Reference rope bridge ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: {fp|Erm}, you said about one and a half inches, {ph|aseven=seven} o'clock?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay?
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: So I {ab|wa} ... Stay to the left of the gorillas?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Stay to the left, and {fp|er} soon as you pass the gorillas ... you go straight north ... until you're you're level with the rope bridge ...
==F: Right.
==G: then you {fp|er} ... you go east ... and you go across, and you go right across the rope bridge ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Now do you have anything right after the rope bridge, like directly right after the rope ...
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  What you do is then you {fp|er} ... drop down about a centimetre south ...
==F: Yes.
==G: and you keep on your same {ph|trjr} trajectory going {fp|er} ... {fp|er} east ... of the ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I have a waterfall, at the far east.
==G: Yeah {ab|o}.  Yeah.  Okay.
==F: {ab|Oka} ...
==G: Now, what you do is, you keep going east, just ... and just before you reach the waterfall ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: go due north, straight up.
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, now ... At about eleven o'clock from the waterfall I have {fp|er} lost steps ... which is about ...
==F: Lost steps?
==G: two inches away.  Yeah.
==F: No, I don't have that.
==G: You don't have anything {ab|aw} {fp|er} about ...
==F: Two ...
==G: eleven o'clock, two inches away?
==F: {fp|Er}, no.
==G: Okay.  Right there, there's lost steps.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Now what you want to do is, when you {fp|er} ... {ab|whe} when you're going north just before the waterfall ...
==F: Yes.
==G: you keep to the right of the lost steps, so {ab|bas} ... you're straight up ...
==F: Yeah.  Okay, I'm to ... {ab|r} ...
==G: You go straight up and you {ab|g} ... you'll stay to the right of it ...
==F: I'm at the top of the lost steps now.
==G: Okay.  Now, {fp|er} to {fp|er} ... About nine o'clock ... do you have {fp|er} fallen pillars?  From the lost steps, pardon me.
==F: Yeah, I {ab|ha} ... Yes, I do.
==G: Okay.
==F: And ... Okay.  Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Now do you have anything {ph|aat=at} about seven o'clock from the fallen pillars?
==F: I have the flamingoes.
==G: You have flamingoes ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  What you do is, then {fp|er} ... You go left ... or {ab|par} correction {fp|er} ... You go west from the lost steps ...
==F: Across the top, right?
==G: Yeah.  {ab|You} you're still on top of the lost steps.
==F: And about parallel with the fallen pillars?
==G: Yeah.  And about half way in between the lost steps and the fallen pillars you go {ab|d} ... you start angling down on a {ph|south_uh_west=southwest} trajectory ...
==F: Southwest {ab|tr} ... So I just ... go by the bottom {fp|er} right-hand corner of the fallen pillars?
==G: Yeah.  And then you straighten right out as soon as you {fp|er} ... you come in line with the {fp|er} ...
==F: {ab|F} ...
==G: beginning of the fallen pillars.
==F: The bottom of them, right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay, I'm going across the bottom of the fallen pillars now ...
==G: Okay.  Now looks like what we want to do is, you want to go south, and you want to hook around the flamingoes.  You want to go underneath, and stay to the left of the flamingoes.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay.  Now, {fp|er} ...
==F: So I've gone all the way round the flamingoes?
==G: {ab|A} ...
==F: Just about?
==G: Yeah.  Okay.  Now {fp|er}, do you have ... Reference {fp|er} your flamingoes, do you have at about one o'clock, about three, three and a half inches away, do you have ancient ruins?
==F: One o'clock.  Yeah, I have ruined city.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is you {fp|er} ...
==F: Three birds on top.
==G: Okay.  {ab|Y} You want to angle towards the ancient ruins ...
==F: Yes.
==G: but you want to keep ... to the left of it.
==F: So you ...
==G: So you angle towards, and you keep to the left, of the ancient ruins.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the ancient ruins now.
==G: Okay.  Now, twelve o'clock, directly twelve o'clock about {fp|er} ... again three, three inches away, do you have stones?
==F: Okay.  Reference the three birds at the top of ruined city ...
==G: Sorry?
==F: Okay, reference the three birds at the top there ... of ...
==G: The three what?  {ab|Ye} {fg|oh} yeah!  Okay.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now, reference that ...
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: at {ab|w} two o'clock, I have a rock fall.  But I have nothing at twelve o'clock.
==G: You have nothing at two o'clock?  How far two o'clock?
==F: Okay.  I have rock fall at about ... two inches.
==G: Two inches away to the right?
==F: Yeah.  To the ... northeast, from the ruined city I have {ab|r} ...
==G: Okay, I don't have that.  Okay, looks like what you want to do is, you got {fp|er} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you got rock fall ... Okay.  {ab|Direc} ... Okay, with me, three inches away, I have stones. {fp|Er} {ab|refere} ...
==F: To the north, right?
==G: Yeah.  {ab|Wha} ... I guess what you want to do is, you want to ... go underneath the stones ...
==F: Right.
==G: And yet you want to stay on top of the rock fall. So when you ... I guess you go up north ... and you ...
==F: Straight north, so I'm on the left side of ruined city still?
==G: Yeah.  And then you go straight, and I guess {fp|er} ... You have the rock fall there.  You just want to swoop around to the right so you're right on top of the rock fall.
==F: Okay, so I go underneath the stones, right?
==G: Yeah.  You go underneath the stones.  You're right on top of the rock fall.
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  Now, reference the {fp|er} stones, do you have a {fp|er} ... {fp|er} I guess about three o'clock ... {fp|er} two inches away, do you have a white mountain?
==F: Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... {ab|M} My white mountain ...
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: {fp|Erm}.  If you draw a line between ruined city and white mountain ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: that's where my rock fall is.
==G: Okay.
==F: So, do you ... Do I go ... Do I go ... Which side do I go?  Above the rock fall or below the rock fall?
==G: No, you go above the rock fall.
==F: Okay, so I'm above the rock fall, I do have a white mountain.
==G: Okay.  Basically you want to ... The way the the mountain peak goes you do the exact same thing, sticking right by it.  You go up on the {fp|er} northeast trajectory, when you reach the peak you come down on the southeast trajectory.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay.  And {ab|whe} ... and when you're right ... when you're right level with the {fp|er} wording {ci|white mountain} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You start ... Okay.  Okay, we'll just leave that for a sec.  Do you have anything below the white mountain?
==F: I have the lost steps on the right side.  Like {fp|er}, reference the {ab|wo} the word {ci|mountain} ...
==G: Yeah.  Yeah, {ab|ok} okay, I got that ... Okay.  Now.  Directly right below white mountain, about {fp|er} ... an inch, I have the biggest furniture store.
==F: {ab|A} An inch below the white mountain, eh?
==G: Yeah.  {ab|S} So what you want to do is, you want to swoop around the white mountain ...

==G: Okay, go towards the edge of the lake ...
==F: All right.
==G: Stop when you get to the edge of the lake at {le|e}.
==F: Right at the beach of it?
==G: Yes.
==F: There.
==G: Turn left ... You come to a point where the {ab|l} lake goes up ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Keep going straight, in the same line you've been travelling, towards cornfields ...
==F: All right.
==G: Stop.  That is it.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay, can you hear me okay, Bill?
==F: Fine.
==G: Okay, we're starting at the crest of the waterfalls on the bottom right side ...
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay, we're going to come down to the {ph|llleft=left} of it ... sharply ... you get to the bottom of the {fp|uh} waterfalls ... stop.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Do you have any landmarks over there?
==F: To ... the ... left I have a banana tree.
==G: Banana tree?  {fp|Uh} {ab|tw} ... reference it for me.
==F: {ph|Iiit=It} ... If there was another landmark it would be {ab|t} ... it'd be just to the left of the other landmark, left of crest falls.
==G: Okay ...
==F: Does that make sense to you?
==G: Kind of.  {fp|Uh} do you have ...
==F: It's about ... three ... inches to the left of crest falls.
==G: Okay.  That's the only landmark you have?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, we're going around on the left side of it ...
==F: On the left side of banana tree ...
==G: Yes.
==F: or the space?
==G: {fp|Uh}, the banana tree.
==F: All right.
==G: {ab|O} ...

==G: Yeah, okay.  Do you have footbridge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, we're going up, even with footbridge, and we're going to cross it.
==F: On an angle?  {ab|T} ... Go up to the footbridge?
==G: Just go {ab|st} ... Yeah, go straight up the page and then {ab|c} {fp|uh} as you get towards the footbridge start curving in to it, and we're going to walk across it. ... Once you get to the other side, stop.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, do you have poisoned stream?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay, what we're going to do here is we're going to {ph|ssstep=step} off the footbridge and come down the page, an inch ... straight down, and stop. Okay?
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have old temple?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, we're going to come along ... and we're going on the left side of old temple.  When you get to the peak of old temple, stop.
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have any landmarks around there?
==F: I have slate mountain to the left and above it.
==G: Okay, did you have abandoned truck?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to go around the top of abandoned mountain ...
==F: Of {ab|s} ... Of ... abandoned {ab|tru} ...
==G: Or ... Not abandoned mountain ... Of {fp|uh} your mountain, there ...
==F: Slate mountain?
==G: Slate mountain?  Okay.
==F: All right.
==G: We're ...

==F: Okay, slate mountain is directly below that.
==G: Yes.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so go up? ... To the top of slate mountain?
==G: Yeah.  Okay, once you're at the top we're going to go straight ... well, it's on a forty five degree angle to the {le|k} in {ci|truck}. ... Okay?
==F: All right.
==G: Stop there.  We're going to go straight left {ip|til=until} you get to the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned} ...
==F: All right.
==G: Stop there.  Go straight down.
==F: Down?
==G: Straight down, approximately one inch.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, we're going to make a two-inch circle going ... heading back up. It's going to the left ... Okay?
==F: Towards white mountain?
==G: Towards white mountain.  Come up to the peak of white mountain ...
==F: On the left?
==G: On the left.
==F: All right.
==G: And stop.
==F: All right.
==G: Go straight up the page ... {ip|til=until} you get to ... the base ... even with pyramid, if you have it.
==F: Do you have lemon grove?
==G: No.
==F: I have pyramid ...
==G: Okay.
==F: So ... even with {ph|bay-suv=base of} pyramid?

==F: {ab|T} ...
==G: approximately a quarter of an inch distance spacing.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Do you have cobbled street?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay, we're going to come underneath the pyramid, sticking {ph|rrreally=really} close to the word {ci|pyramid}.  You get to the left-hand edge of {ab|py} the pyramid, stop.
==F: All right.
==G: Do you have remote village?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, we're going down to remote village ... {ab|s} on a slight angle to the left ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, you get in line with the word {ci|white mountain}, and we'll turn to the right going to the word {ci|remote village} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: go approximately half an inch past the {le|e} ... stop.
==F: There.
==G: That's it.
==G: Okay, Adam.  Starting point is right above the site of a forest fire. Do you have that?
==F: Got both of them.
==G: You got both forest fires?
==F: No, I got the {ab|s} forest fire and the start point.
==G: Okay.  Do you have the {fp|er} ... Directly below the site of the forest fire do you have a picnic site?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  About {fp|er} directly, six o'clock, about {fp|er} ... inch and a half down, there's a picnic site.
==F: An inch and a half down?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And {fp|er} reference ... the site of forest fire, at about four o'clock about {fp|er} an inch away there's an adventure playground.
==F: Got it.
==G: You got it?  Okay.
==F: Yeah.
==G: So what you want to do is, you want to start above the {fp|er} ... start {ph|thuuuh=the} site of forest fire ... You want to {fp|er} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you start dead-centre on top of the site of the forest fire.  You curve around, so you're on the left-hand side of the ... left-hand side of the forest fire ...
==F: Got it.
==G: and then you go {ph|ssstraight=straight} down ... due south ... then you {ab|cur} and {ab|y} {ab|y} you keep to the {fp|er} left of the {fp|er} picnic site ...
==F: Got it.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?  Then you hang a sharp right ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, and as soon as you reach pretty much {fp|er} the last {ab|picn} {fp|er} the last bench ... {gg|Oh} shit, you don't have picnic site there.  Okay.  Right where the {le|e} from {fp|er} the {ci|forest fire} is ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, soon as you pass that, with your pen mark ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: go due north, straight ... and as soon as you come ... directly in line with ... {ph|thiii=the} the site of forest fire ... you {fp|er} ... go ... east ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: but on a slight north tangent.  Okay?  Now {fp|erm}, let's see. Do you have a {fp|er} ... Okay, {ab|r} ... Do you have a train crossing at about {fp|er} one o'clock from the site of forest fire?
==F: Like at the top of the page?
==G: Not near the top.  Out in the middle.
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a granite quarry?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is {fp|er} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're {ab|a} ... you're {ab|a} {ab|a} ... you're at the {fp|er} ... the right of the adventure playground right now ... Okay, so you're at {ph|thiii=the} ... So {ab|y} ... So you start going ... east ... on a slight northern tangent ...
==F: Right.
==G: Okay.  Now, do you have ...
==F: Do you have the privately owned fields?
==G: Sorry?
==F: Reference the adventure playground ...
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: one o'clock, an inch and a half, privately owned fields?
==G: I don't have that.
==F: Okay.
==G: So the chances are you're going underneath it.  Okay, up in the top right corner of the page, do you have an east lake?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Directly where the {le|e} in {ci|east} is ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, soon as you come into line with that ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you go straight north.  Now you say you have that quarry, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, reference the quarry.  At about {fp|er} seven o'clock, about {fp|er} ... inch and a half away, there's a train-crossing.
==F: {ph|Sss} ... Okay.  The quarry, seven o'clock ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: inch and a half away ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: got a train-crossing?
==G: Yeah.  Okay, do {ab|yo} ... do you have a waterfall?
==F: Yeah, I got the waterfall.
==G: Okay, it's pretty much {fp|er} almost right below that but a bit to the right.
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|Er} {ab|w} about an inch away from the waterfall.
==F: Okay.
==G: You ... you got that marked down?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, {fp|er} ... {ph|njd} ... Reference the {fp|er} {le|y} in the word {ci|quarry} ...
==F: Yes.
==G: As soon as you hit that you start curving ...
==F: {ab|O} Okay, hang on a sec.
==G: Okay.
==F: These privately owned fields I have ...
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: are right below the ... granite quarry, about two inches below.
==G: Okay.  No, {ab|yo} you're to the right of them.
==F: {gg|Oh} ... To the left of them.
==G: {ph|Naaaaaa=No} ... If they're right below the granite quarry you should be to the {fp|er} ...
==F: {ab|T} ...
==G: should be to the right of them.
==F: {ab|T} To the east of them?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.  I I misunderstood you then.  Take me back.  I'm at the top of the playground.
==G: Okay.  You're at the top of the playground?
==F: Yes.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You go {fp|er} east ...
==F: Right.
==G: Keep going east ... and where there's {gg|ah} ... the {le|e} in {ci|east lake} is ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: pretty much as soon as you {fp|er} ... as soon as you're in line with that, as soon as you're like {fp|er} dead ... dead straight ...
==F: Yeah.  Got it.
==G: you go straight up.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And that should take you ... It should take you on the right-hand side.
==F: Yeah.  It does.
==G: Okay.
==F: So how ... Sorry, how far up do I go?
==G: Okay, you {fp|er} ... You reach the {le|y} in {ci|quarry} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and you start curving {fp|er} ... Buck. ... you start curving to the left.  Okay?  But you're still ... you're still on the right-hand side of the quarry ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: but instead of going straight you start curving to the left and you ... and you sort of hook around.
==F: Hook around the top of the quarry, right?
==G: Yeah.  And you {ab|k} ... you keep the hook around and you ... and you sort of {ph|ssstraighten=straighten} it out ...
==F: {ab|Ye} ...
==G: but you're still going straight down ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  {ab|Th} {fp|erm} ... And you keep going straight down until you {fp|er} ...
==F: Towards the train crossing?
==G: Yeah.  Thing is though, {ab|a} as soon as you ... as soon as your pen comes in contact with the ... or {fp|er} the same line as the {le|g} in {ci|granite} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you straighten out.
==F: Straight south?
==G: No.  No.  No.  Straight {fp|er} west.
==F: Do I go {ab|at} across the top of the train crossing?
==G: Yeah.  You're you're on top of the ... the train crossing ...
==F: Okay, that's where I am now.
==G: Okay.  And you're below the waterfall.
==F: I'm right below the {le|f} in {ci|fall}.
==G: Okay. And okay {fp|er} ... See where the {le|w} in {ci|waterfall} is?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Soon as you reach that you start going {fp|er} ... {ab|y} you curve and gradually go north.  So by the time you actually ... Okay. {ab|Th} As soon as you're below the waterfall ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: the the {le|w} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you start curving up ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: and as soon as you reach the {le|w} ... beside you ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you should be going straight north.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Up {ph|theeee=the} {ab|r} left-hand side of the waterfall?
==G: Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, now, do you have something right above the waterfall?  Like directly above the waterfall?
==F: Not directly above it.  One o'clock I have a ... public footpath.
==G: Public footpath.  Okay.  Looks like what you want to do is you want to {fp|er} ... As soon as you reach the top of the waterfall ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: hang sharp right ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and as soon as {fp|er} you reach ... the {fp|er} ... the last part of the picture on waterfall, like the last top peak ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you go due north again, and you go north {fp|erm} ...
==F: Do you {ab|ha} ...
==G: Okay.  Reference {fp|er} east lake ...

==F: I'm going due north.
==G: Yeah.  You go an inch.
==F: Yes.
==G: Then you make a sharp right at about {fp|er} ... half inch ...
==F: {ab|Y} {ab|K} Okay ... Right ...
==G: Okay.  Now, reference the granite quarry.  At about {fp|er} two o'clock do you have a fallen cairn?
==F: A a {ab|fa} ... Yeah, a {ab|fall} ... Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is, you want to angle towards that ... and {ab|y} ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I've got to go round this public footpath of mine.
==G: Yeah.  {ab|Yo} yeah, looks like you {ab|go} ... You got ... Looks like you got to go round it.
==F: Do you have cornfields?
==G: I have cornfields, straight straight ... Okay.  As soon as you reach your {fp|er} ... Yeah.  I got cornfields.  Yeah.
==F: So, {fp|erm}, this ... this {fp|er} public footpath ...
==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: the top of it is right below the {le|c}.  About an inch and a half down.
==G: Okay, now, yeah.  You {fp|er} ...
==F: I go over top of it?
==G: No ... No.  I don't ... I don't have the ... I don't have the footpath on my map at all.  So looks like you want to avoid that.
==F: Okay.  So I'm at the tip of the waterfall still.
==G: Okay.  Now, {ph|hya} ... Have you gone ... Have you gone {fp|er} ...
==F: I'm ...
==G: north an inch?
==F: North an inch, yes.
==G: Okay, and you've gone half an inch {fp|er} ... east?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  Soon as you've done that, then {ab|y} ... Okay.  {ab|Th} you start going south ... {fp|erm} ... Pretty much {ab|y} ... Head towards the fallen cairn ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Like, head ... Like angle straight for it.  But keep to the left of it.  And as soon as you reach the {le|f} in the word {ci|fallen} ...
==F: Okay, I'm going to go across this footpath ... thing.
==G: Okay.  I don't have the footpath on my map though.
==F: Okay.  I guess you'll walk in the footpath.  Okay.  I'm heading towards the fallen cairn.
==G: Okay.  And as soon as you reach the {fp|er} ... As soon as your pen ... reaches the same line as the {le|f} ... in {ab|f} ... in {ci|fallen} ...
==F: Yeah.

==G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
==F: Right below the word {ci|east}.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is ... Okay.  Directly, right right beside that ... about {fp|er} an inch away ... you have limestone cliffs ...
==F: I go {ph|be-te-tween=between} ...
==G: You ... You go between them.
==F: {ab|Go} ... Okay.  I'm ... at the bottom of east lake now.
==G: Okay.  Follow the shore ...

==G: Do you have anything between pyramid and white mountain?
==F: I have {fp|er} between {fp|er} ... I ... Just to the {fp|er} ... right of white mountain I have remote village ...
==G: Okay.
==F: I have a poisoned stream ...
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==F: and directly above ... {fp|er} white mountain I have a lemon grove.

==F: Yeah.
==G: {fg|Erm}, I have a cobbled street between pyramid and remote village.
==F: I have {fp|er} nothing.
==G: Okay.  So {fg|erm}, go ... left and {ab|s} ... and down, like on a ... bit of a slant ... and then down the {ab|l} ... to the left-hand corner of remote village ...
==F: {fg|Er}, do I cross {ph|theeee} ... {fp|er} ... cobbled street?
==G: No.  No you don't.  You ... keep it {fg|er} ... Okay, cobbled street ...
==F: Okay.
==G: the left-hand edge of it ... is just a little bit ... past the corner of the pyramid.  So go out a little bit ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  And then, come down ... to {fp|er} ... remote village ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: the left-hand side ... Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And go straight ... under ... remote village ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and ... just to the right, is your finish. That's it.
==F: The end.
==G: Okay, Adam.  Reference your start point.
==F: Seen.
==G: Okay, do you have anything ... Do you have any landmarks right below it, like, in the ... in the line there?
==F: No, all I have is burnt forest off to the right.
==G: Then do you have anything below that?
==F: I have {ab|c} carpenter's cottage right below, like an inch below {fp|uh} burnt forest.
==G: Okay.  And you have nothing to the left of carpenter cottage.
==F: Nothing.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is {fp|uh} ... Reference your start {ab|poi} ... Okay {fp|uh} actually, reference carpenter cottage.  To {fp|uh} the right of it, an inch away, do you have anything there?
==F: I have a ravine.
==G: Okay, right above it, do you have anything?
==F: No.
==G: The ravine.  You have nothing above the ravine?
==F: Nothing.
==G: Okay, so about {fp|uh} ... an inch away from the burnt forest you have a remote village.
==F: Remote village?
==G: Yeah.
==F: So there's four of them in a little square there?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay.  You got your starting point?
==F: Got it.
==G: What you do is {fp|uh} you go south, but you head towards the burnt forest a bit.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And as as soon as ... Like, you you start aiming {ab|k} ... aiming towards the {le|b} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And as soon as your {fp|uh} pen ... like {ab|yo} ... As soon as the ink {fp|uh} comes in the same line as it, you start curving the opposite way and what you want to do is you want to swing out and, looks like, keep to the left of carpenter cottage, {ip|til=until} you get to the bottom of it, make a sharp right, go east ... until {fp|uh} ... you're right below the {le|e} in {fp|uh} the word {ci|forest} ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: then what you do is you go {fp|uh} up on a {fp|uh} northeast trajectory, and you go up above the ravine, as soon as you're on top of the ravine {ab|yo} you make a sharp right.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And so {fp|uh} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a {fp|uh} pine grove?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, what you do is {fp|uh} ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're in between the ravine and the remote village, you go about an inch, inch and a half, then what you do is {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... go ... southeast down towards the pine grove ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: And as soon as you {fp|uh} ... As soon as your pen comes in the same line as the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you swing out to the right ... Okay, do you have anything right below the pine grove?
==F: Avalanche.
==G: You have an avalanche?
==F: Do you have an avalanche?
==G: No I don't.  That's what it is.  Okay, you want to swing out {ab|arou} ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, hang on a sec ... avalanche.  Reference {fp|uh} the {le|e} in {ci|pine grove}, the last {le|e}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: It's {fp|uh} five o'clock.  It's about an inch away, so it's close to the edge of the paper.
==G: {fg|Oh}, okay, it's on the other side!
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, well, looks like what you want to do is you want to ... swing towards it, yet you don't want to go around it, so you want to swing towards it, but you want to keep to the left side of the avalanche.
==F: Okay, so ... sorry, hang on a second.  I've got ... I'm in level with the {le|p}, right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Of {ci|pine grove} ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: And I swing to the south now?
==G: {fp|Uh}, {ab|y} you're swinging towards ... {ab|Y} You're still going south but {ab|y} you {fp|uh} ... Basically, look at a pregnant lady sideways, at her abdomen, the way that it is ...
==F: Right.
==G: How it juts out and then {ab|i} it swoops back in ...
==F: So is she {ab|l} ... {ab|Wh} ... Is her belly facing the bottom of the paper?
==G: Her her belly's facing towards the {fp|uh} the edge of the paper where the avalanche is.
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay, seen.
==G: So you ... So you swing back out and then you ... {ab|whe} when you ... when you {ph|sig} swing back in, you should be right below the {le|r} in {ci|pine grove} ...
==F: So all ... I go all the way out towards the avalanche, then?  With this pregnant belly?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And I come back?
==G: You come back in, yeah.
==F: Below the {le|r}?
==G: Yeah.  Okay, so you're at the {le|r}.  Okay now, below the avalanche you have a {ab|c} a concealed hideout?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, you want to do the exact same thing, you want to swing out to the right ... Actually, yeah, you ... Okay, {ab|thi} this one you want to encircle so {ab|y} you go over top of it and you hook around ...
==F: I go between avalanche and concealed hideout?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And I go ... do a buttonhook around concealed hideout.
==G: {ab|Button} ... Yeah.  And then you go straight across so you're going straight west.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading west.
==G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...
==F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
==G: Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.

==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I don't have that.

==G: Okay now, okay, looking at the word {ci|crane bay} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: See where the {le|b} and the {le|a} is?
==F: Yes.
==G: Directly above you got, like, a {ab|p} a peak?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  As you swing around the concealed hideout you're going straight ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Soon as you reach that peak ...
==F: {ab|Y} ...
==G: you you like drop straight down and you follow that curve, going around, until you get to, like, the top of the {le|c}.  In the word {ci|crane}.
==F: Yeah.
==G: So you just follow the contour.
==F: Yeah, I'm there.  I'm at the {ab|t} ...
==G: Okay now do you have a coconut palm to the left of you?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} there's a coconut palm about an inch away from the shore of crane bay.

==G: Okay, the coconut palm is one o'clock about a {ab|ha} ... three-quarter inch away.
==F: {ab|Cocon} ...
==G: So {ab|ba} basically all's you want to do is you just want to go in between the coconut palm and the pebbled shore.  So {ab|i} {ab|w} ... if you swoop down ...
==F: {ab|A} ...
==G: and just skim across top the ... of the pebbled shore you'll miss the coconut palm.
==F: So I skim the shoreline a little bit longer?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Go underneath the coconuts ...
==G: Go ... Yeah.
==F: And above the pebbled shore?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm at the top there then.

==F: On their left side?
==G: Yeah.
==F: So I drop down?
==G: Yeah, so basically you swing around pebbled shore ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And pretty much you're going diagonally down until you come in {ab|b} ... I guess ... line with the top of that {fp|uh} washed stones ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Then you buttonhook right around ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And your finish ... your finish {le|x} is about one centimetre away from the {ab|f} {fp|uh} the shore.  Directly in line with the flagship.

==G: On the ... On ... Yeah, go underneath and go east, and that's where your finish is.  So you got to go ... along the left side of the gazelles ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and underneath them.
==F: Okay indecipherableSpeech too easy. And then go east for about two inches past the gazelles and we're there.
==G: Two, two and a half inches, right.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, then?
==F: Good to go.
==G: Okay, Mark, start-line {fp|er} just above the diamond mine.
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  We're going to go ... down ... on the {fp|er} left side of the diamond mine.
==F: Okay.
==G: We're going to come underneath the word {ci|diamond mine}, not touching the word ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  To your right is there a wagon wheel?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  But you have a rift valley?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  The {fp|er} wagon wheel ... is in the centre between the diamond mine and the rift valley, but below the rift valley.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, from the ...
==F: So it's it's more or less even with the diamond mine?
==G: {ph|Dyeah=Yeah}.  Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Pretty well level and {fp|er} ... in the centre ... between the {fp|er} rift valley and the diamond mine.  Okay.  {fp|Er} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You're now going to {fp|er} take the the line ... that's just below the {fp|er} diamond mine, and you're going to {fp|er} ... go {fp|er} ... {br|north east=northeast} on a ... ten degree angle ... and you're not going to go ... The line will not go above {ph|thuuu=the} the level of the diamond mine ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.
==F: So I'm passing under the wagon wheel?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Then for about ... when you reach about half way {br|i in=in} the centre between the rift valley {br|an and=and} the diamond mine ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: stop there.  {ph|Yi-uhl=You'll} go ... north, about half an inch ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you'll go ... northwest ... about ... another half an inch ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then from there you'll take it, and {fp|er} ... on the left side of {ab|d} of the river valley, {fp|er}, there's a bush or a tree ...
==F: {fp|Er}, the rift valley?
==G: Yeah.  On the left side.
==F: Okay.  Yeah.
==G: On the ... on the left corner there.
==F: Okay.
==G: You're going to take the line and you're going to ... {ab|s} {fp|er} swoop it over that tree without touching it and {ab|y} ... and dissect the rift valley in the centre.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  From there ...
==F: Just a sec ...
==G: you're going to go straight down south ... about two inches ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now you have rocks below rift valley?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: And you have ... a stone creek to the {fp|er} left?
==F: I have ... Yes, rapids.
==G: {fg|Er} ... white water rapids you mean?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  But you have no stone creek?
==F: {fg|Er}, no.
==G: Okay.  To the left of rocks you have a stone creek ... and above white water you have {fp|er} ... stone creek and {fp|er} ... White water and stone creek are {ph|fffairly=fairly} close together ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {fg|Er}, no more than {fp|er} ... I'd say, an inch separates the {fp|er} ... stone creek from the white water ... on the right-hand corner, top.
==F: {ab|O} ... Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You're going to take that line ... and {fp|er} on the {fp|er} ... rocks, the second boulder ... the large boulder ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You're going to take that line and you're going to go ... you're going to go {ab|n} {fp|er} southwest ... on a ... ten degree angle.  You're going to underneath stone creek ... but above white water ...
==F: Okay.  Does stone creek run parallel with the top of the rapids?
==G: {fg|Er}, yes.
==F: Okay. ... Okay, so, continue the line ... I am above the rapids now.
==G: Okay.  Now {fp|er}, on the left side of the rapids, the top ...
==F: Yes.
==G: the line will start to {fp|er} arc down.  You'll be going south ... Now below white water do you have ... anything?
==F: I have a manned fort about two inches below.
==G: Two inches below?
==F: Two, two and a half inches.
==G: Two and a half inches below ... white water, the word {ci|white water}?
==F: Yes.  The rapids.
==G: Okay.  I want you to go {ph|waaaaaay=way} ... way below ... the manned fort ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and come underneath it ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: draw draw the {ph|ss} so that you have the circle coming right underneath ... the manned fort ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and just as you get underneath it, just stop there.
==F: Okay.  What do you have ... Do you have a manned fort?
==G: I don't have a manned fort.
==F: Okay.  Do you have the stone creek or the stone slabs?
==G: I have stone slabs and I have an outlaws' hideout.
==F: Okay.  I have outlaws' hideout.
==G: And you have a {ab|s} ...
==F: Okay, so you want me to bring it under the manned fort?  Okay, I'm there.
==G: Okay, yes.  Now.  Arc the line so you're now going ... {fp|er} {br|north east=northeast} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: on about a fifty degree angle, and you're going to go directly below the word {ci|outlaws' hideout} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then the line will start to curve again and you will go down the side of the page.  You'll be no more than ... I I'd say a quarter of an inch from the edge of the page ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a gold mine just below outloiz hard out? Outlaws' hideout?
==G: {fg|Er} {ph|nnnnnn} no I don't.
==F: Okay.  I'll go between gold mine and edge of page then.
==G: Okay.
==F: It's where you want me to go.
==G: And you have noose?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  I want you to ... continue the line ... so ... that it stops ... at the word {ci|noose} ... where the line is straight down ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Stops at the ... east hand end of {ci|noose}?
==G: Yes it does.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now from there ... your line will start to {ab|c} {fp|er} ... form a circle again and {fp|er} do you have a swan pond?
==F: I do not.
==G: Okay.  You do not have a swan pond?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a saloon bar?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  The saloon bar is ... {ip|bout=about} three inches to the right ... I'm sorry, so ... the swan pond is three inches to the right of saloon bar ... and it's about ... an inch and a half down from the noose ... and about ... an inch and a half to the left.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now, the line ... You were going to {fp|er} ... form a circle. You're {ab|g} ... You're going to take that line from {fp|er} ... the {fp|er} east side of {fp|er} noose ...
==F: Yes.
==G: and go {fp|er} southwest ... and when when you get about {fp|er} ... an inch ... away from the noose ... {ph|da-da-da} {fp|er} the distance between the noose and ... {ab|n} the middle of the page there ... you'll stop there. {ab|Act} actually the line will be {br|d directly=directly} in line with stone slabs if you ... if you draw {ab|d} an imaginary straight line down ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  Now stop there and ... That's where the swan pond is.  I want you to ... go now ... {br|north west=northwest} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: so you missed the swan pond and go ... over it ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And then go ... {ph|dooown=down} ... Okay, now on the {fp|er} ... left side of stone slabs ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Draw another imaginary line straight down.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now where that line stops ... is where the {fp|er} left-hand edge of swan pond is.
==F: Okay.
==G: From there ... you're going to go underneath the saloon bar ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  You'll come up {fp|er} ... on the {fp|er} bottom left corner ...
==F: Okay.
==G: The line will start to ... go slowly {fp|er} to your {fp|er} ... {br|i it=it} will start to go up north ... and your finish line ... is {fp|er} at the top of the saloon {fp|er} bar {fp|er} ... roof ...
==F: Okay.
==G: approximately, about {ph|aan=an} inch and a half to your left.  Okay?
==F: Okay.  Even with the top of the roof?
==G: Pretty well even.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Start line's bottom left-hand corner.  You got a ... site of a forest fire, Rob?
==F: No I don't.
==G: You don't?  {gg|Ah} okay.  Well that's ...
==F: No.  I have a {ab|play} ... adventure ground here.  Adventure playground?
==G: Okay.  Well {fp|er}, site of the forest fire is {fp|er} ... right {ab|be} ... right below your {fp|er} start line, and then below that's a ...
==F: {gg|Oh} yeah, I got that.  Yeah.  Yeah.
==G: {ph|Mwaan}.  {fp|Er}, below that's the picket site ... picnic site.
==F: No.  I don't have a picnic site.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, well, we'll go round that.  And then {fp|er} ... adventure ground?
==F: Yeah.  I got that.
==G: And then, far right corner is a farm land?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  In the middle you got a ... train crossing?
==F: No.  I got a private owned fields.
==G: Say again.
==F: I have privately owned fields.

==F: Yeah.
==G: {fp|Er}, to the left, cornfields?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then another train crossing in the far left corner.
==F: Okay.  I have two things that you haven't mentioned. Iron country, it's called, right under east lake, {ip|bout=about} two fingers right below {ci|east} ...
==G: Okay.

==F: Okay.
==G: and along the top of it ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then head ... east ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: About {fp|er} ... four fingers from the right-hand side of the paper, start heading north ... right up and go around the granite quarry.

==G: Playground.
==F: Four fingers, you said?
==G: From the edge of the paper.
==F: {gg|Oh} okay.  Yeah, okay.
==G: And then {fp|er}, head up and around the granite site.
==F: Which way around the granite site?
==G: {fp|Er} ... {br|Y you're=You're} headed {fp|er} {br|s straight=straight} straight north and then go over top of the granite site.  To the left.

==F: Go up and over ... the pyramid ...?
==G: And then down around the bottom.
==F: Down around the bottom.
==G: {ip|Til=Until} {fp|erm} you come to {fp|er} ... about ... two fingers ... to the west of the {le|p} there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And then head straight down ... {fp|er} and then go right underneath the remote village there ... and then about one finger from the {le|e} is your finish line.  Of {ci|village}.
==F: Okay. {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay Jason, do you have a start on your map?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Is it above the site of the forest fire?
==F: Yes it is.
==G: Do you have a picnic site to the {fp|uh} ... south of that?
==F: To the southeast I have adventure playground.
==G: Okay.  Now, {fp|uh} do you have a finish line, or a finish mark?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay ... From your start ... point ...
==F: Yes.
==G: {fp|uh}, go to the left of the {fp|uh} site of the forest fire ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And take that line down ... about four inches.  Until it's about {ph|twooooo=two} or so inches above the bottom of the page.  Take that straight down in the south {ab|sou} southerly direction.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, now take that east until it comes about in line with the edge of the letter {le|a} in {ci|adventure playground}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now take that line straight up until you just pass the top of the cage.  Okay?
==F: Okay.
==G: Now do you have anything to the {fp|uh} east ... of adventure playground?
==F: To the east?
==G: Yeah.
==F: To the northeast I have privately owned field.
==G: Okay.  And above the privately owned field do you have a granite quarry?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Go ... to the {fp|uh} ... Go in a north easterly direction ... {fp|uh} underneath the privately owned field ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: And {fp|uh} ... up the right-hand side.  Okay?
==F: Okay.
==G: Now go up, in a {br|nor northerly=northerly} direction, up to the {fp|uh} ... up the right-hand side of the granite quarry and over the top until you reach the peak at the very top of the granite quarry.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  Now do you have a train crossing?  To the southwest of the granite quarry?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay, do you have a waterfall to the west?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, now take that line southwest or in a southwesterly direction ...
==F: Okay.
==G: for about two inches until you come about ... {fp|uh} half an inch underneath the word {ci|waterfall}, until you're in line with that, half an inch ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Take that line {fg|eh} west, due west, until you come in line with the left edge of the waterfall ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Head straight up {fp|uh} in a northerly direction until you reach the top of the waterfall or the peak of the waterfall ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Now do you have anything directly north of the waterfall?
==F: Directly north?
==G: Yes.
==F: Northeast I have public {ab|tooth} {ph|tootpath=footpath}.
==G: Okay.  Now to the northwest of that do you have a train crossing?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is go between {fp|um} ... Take your line east ... {fp|uh} across the top of the waterfall between the waterfall and that public path or whatever it is.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now to the northeast of the waterfall, do you have something there?
==F: To the northeast?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Public {ph|toothpath=footpath} ... {ph|tootpath=footpath}.
==G: {ph|Toot path=footpath}?
==F: {ph|Toot path=footpath}.
==G: {ph|Toothpath=footpath}.  Now do you have {ab|anythi} ... Yeah {ab|si} is ... Do you have anything directly north of the waterfall, though?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay.  So what you want to do is take that line east until you ... and then ... {ab|hea} {fp|uh} ... curve up the left-hand side side of the public {ph|tootpath=footpath} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And take {fp|uh} ... And then then turn {ab|r} east for about an inch and a half.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay. Now do you have anything directly north of you?  You should have a {ab|cornfiel} ...
==F: Cornfield.
==G: Cornfield, okay.  Now do you have fallen cairns?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  And that's {fp|uh} below the limestone cliffs?  Or ... It's {fp|uh} sort of {fp|uh} ...
==F: I do not have limestone cliffs.
==G: Do you have ... You have the granite quarry?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: That's to the northeast of the granite quarry?
==F: The fallen cairn?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Yes it is.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is take the line where you stopped ...
==F: Yes.
==G: go directly southeast until you come to the {le|f} in {ci|{ab|fa}} ... just off the {le|f} in {ci|fallen cairn} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then turn east and head straight underneath {fp|uh} ... go east underneath fallen cairn ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then up the right-hand side, until you come level with the rocks ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you want to turn northwest and go {br|i in=in} a northwesterly direction for about two inches ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Now, you notice up in east lake there's {fp|uh} ... in the bottom shore there's sort of two little {fp|uh} hump type lines there?
==F: On the east shore?
==G: In in east lake.
==F: Yes.
==G: There are on the ... on the {ab|southerl} {ab|souther} {ab|southerl} {ab|souther} {ph|southmorsht} shore ...
==F: Yes.
==G: there's {fp|uh} a sort of a {fp|uh} two {fp|uh} faint humps in the {fp|uh} shoreline?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay, what you want to do with that line that you just stopped, you want to be in line with the {ab|r} {fp|uh} rightmost edge of the rightmost hump, okay?
==F: Okay.
==G: Head straight up until you're about half a centimetre away from the edge of the shoreline ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Turn northwest and follow along the shoreline keeping off about half a centimetre ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And you know where you'll come to a {fp|uh} ... where the {fp|uh} lake will a {ab|n} a a northerly {fp|uh} swing ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Go about {fp|uh} an inch past that and that's your finish mark.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Done.
==G: Okay ... {fg|er} Mark.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Start line is just above crest falls.
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  To the {fp|er} left of crest falls is there anything there?
==F: {fg|Erm} ... Far west of page I have a banana tree.
==G: Okay.  A banana tree.  Okay.  Where the start line is ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you're going to ... You're going to take the line and you're going to go {fp|er} ... west {ab|a} ... Then you're going to arc it down {ph|don=on} the {fp|er} ... {ab|we} {fp|er} west side of {fp|er} crest falls ...
==F: Okay.
==G: not touching the falls at all.
==F: Okay.
==G: You're going to get about three-quarters of the way down ... Right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: And the ... the line starts to {fp|er} curve ... {fp|er} {br|south west=southwest} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And you're going to go below the banana tree ... {fp|er} so so the line's parallel ...
==F: Okay.
==G: **NEW SFO READING REQUIRED with the word {ci|crest falls} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  You're going to continue that line for about {fp|er} ... four inches ... until you're about {fp|er} two inches from the edge of the page ...
==F: Okay.  So I've passed banana tree ...
==G: Yeah.  Just just go directly underneath it so you'd miss it.
==F: Okay.  And I'm two inches from ... west border of page?  Okay.
==G: Yes.  Okay.  Stop there.  Now, do you have a footbridge?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: And you have a poisoned stream?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  Don't worry about that.  Okay. Right where the line stops ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: two inches from the page, I want you to start {fp|er} ... arcing the line, so you're going north ... straight up for about ... two inches ...
==F: Okay.  That'll take me about even with the top of the tree.
==G: {fg|Er} ... What was that?
==F: Bringing me about even with the top of the banana tree?
==G: {fg|Er} ... well, {ab|a} ... Where's the banana tree in relation to the footbridge?
==F: {gg|Oh}, you don't have a banana tree?
==G: No I don't.
==F: {gg|Oh} okay.  {fg|Erm} ... the banana tree is ...
==G: Is it below baboons?
==F: I don't have baboons.
==G: Okay.  You don't have baboons.  Okay.
==F: {fg|Er} ... The tree is ... about an inch ... southwest of the footbridge.
==G: Okay.  Well that's perfect, then.  Okay.  Continue that line ... so that you miss the {fp|er} banana tree completely ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.
==G: and you're going to take that line and you ... are going to ... actually touch the footbridge.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay the ... Okay the first part of the line ... will touch the {fp|erm} ... left side of the footbridge ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: the very top.  Okay.  Now you're going to go across ... You're going to take that line ... and about a quarter of an inch ... past the right side you're going to ... {ab|slowl} {fp|er} ... arc it down ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And stop right there.  Okay.  Now, between footbridge ... and do you have an old temple?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Now between old temple and footbridge, you have a poisoned stream.
==F: Okay.
==G: The poisoned stream ... is ... {ab|a} ... no more ... than an inch from the footbridge.  Actually I'd say about three-quarter of an inches ...
==F: Okay.
==G: So, they're very close.  So, between the ... the {ph|dyer} the poisoned stream and the footbridge ... I want you to take the line and go directly {fp|er} {br|i i in=in} the centre, down ... south, about ... an inch.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay. ... Now I want you to go ... from there, straight across, so that you miss the poisoned stream ...
==F: Okay.  Straight east?
==G: Straight east.
==F: Okay.
==G: For about {fp|er} an inch.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now, the old temple?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You're going to take the line and you're going to arc it up towards the {fp|er} west side of old temple ...
==F: Okay.
==G: so that you are now going north ... and when you get to the peak ... of old temple, stop there.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Now do you have anything {fp|er} between {fp|er} old temple ... {ab|D} Do you have an abandoned truck?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Do you have anything to the right of that?
==F: I ... Yeah, I have a slate mountain.
==G: Okay.  Where you stop with the line I want you to take that line and I want you to go over the top of the mountain so you completely miss it ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Then you're going to {ph|uhng} angle the line down ... and you're going to go down towards the {fp|er} ... letter {le|k} in {ci|truck} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: so you're missing the mountain completely ...
==F: Okay.
==G: so the {ab|ang} ... You You you're now going southwest ...
==F: Okay.  I ... Yeah.  {ab|A} ...
==G: Okay.  Once you get to the {le|k} I want you to take that line and continue it {fp|er} straight ... west ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|til=until} you get to the {le|a} ...
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: In the word {ci|abandoned}?  Okay.  Now.  Just below the the abandoned truck ... {fp|er} you don't have it but {fp|er} I have baboons ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Baboons ... and abandoned truck ... {fp|er} if if you were to take to {fp|er} ... if you were to {fp|er} ... take to {fp|er} ... {fp|er} a distance and measure them, they'd be less than ... half an inch ... from each other.
==F: Okay.
==G: But baboons is about ... {fp|er} half an inch down ... on the left side ... {br|f from=from} the word {ci|abandoned}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  So I want you to ... Where you stopped there with the ... with the line.  I want you to take that line ... and parallel with the edge of {ab|aba} {fp|er} of the abandoned truck ...
==F: Okay.
==G: I want you to go straight down about an inch ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now I want you to arc that line so you {ab|dir} {fp|er} so you're ... you're {fp|er} ... below the {ab|ba} {fp|er} baboons ... So from the abandoned truck ... that line ... you should be ... let's say, about two inches ... down, before you start to ... arcing the line and going {fp|er} straight across west ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Go west about {fp|er} an inch and a half ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You'll be about an inch from the {fp|er} edge of the paper ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And now I want you to start ... arcing it up, so you're going north ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now do you have anything above abandoned truck?
==F: I have a white mountain.
==G: {fp|Er}, okay.
==F: I have lemon grove ...
==G: You have a lemon grove where?
==F: {fp|Er} ... right up close to the top ... of the page.
==G: {fp|Er} ...
==F: I got ... Directly north of the abandoned truck I have a white mountain.  It's about {ph|twoooo=two} and a half inches north.
==G: Okay, so ... But but between white mountain and abandoned truck you have nothing?
==F: No.
==G: Okay. So the line ... where the birds are ... on ... Okay actually you don't have baboons so {ph|ha} ... you can't see the birds, but ... that line will continue on a slight diagonal ... going {br|north east=northeast} until you come up {ph|theeeee=the} {fp|er} left ... the ... actually the west face of the mountain ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You'll be no more than ... I'd say a quarter of an ... of an inch from the {ab|f} west face ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and follow ... the mountain {fp|er} ... {fp|er} the mountain {fp|er} ... shape ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: so you get to the peak ...
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: When you get to the peak I want you to take that line and go directly north, about three inches ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything above white mountain?
==F: Lemon grove.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Lemon grove.  Okay.  {fg|Er}, lemon grove.  Where is it in relation to white mountain?  Is it {fp|er} ... {ab|w} {ab|w} {ab|i} where the where the {ab|we} ...
==F: The ...
==G: the peak is in the mountain, where's the lemon grove?
==F: the westernmost edge of {ph|leven=lemon} grove is {fp|er} {ab|r} directly in line with the peak of the mountain ...
==G: Okay.
==F: and about ... two inches north.
==G: Okay.  I want you to miss lemon {fp|er} ... what is it, lemon ... tree you said?
==F: Lemon grove.
==G: lemon grove completely.  Do you have a pyramid to your right?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  I want you to {fp|er} miss lemon grove completely, go over the top of it ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and take the line and go about three {fp|er} two and a half inches ... {fp|er} east ... until you until ... you come {fp|er} come {fp|er} to the pyramid {fp|er} on the left {ab|s} {fp|er} ... side, you have some sand.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Little bits of sand.  Okay.  You'll you'll be about a quarter of an inch above that before you start arcing the line ... up, over the pyramid ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  You're going to come down ... the east ... face of the pyramid, following the the the shape of the pyramid ...
==F: About how far from the pyramid?
==G: {fg|Oh} about ... quarter of an inch.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  You're going to come ... And then you're going to stop at the {fp|er} bottom right ... {fp|er} ...
==F: Yeah.  I'm there.
==G: part of the pyramid, and you're going to arc the line so you come below the word {ci|pyramid} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and you're going to come to the {fp|er} left edge ... bottom, of the pyramid, and stop there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  You have cobbled street below that?
==F: No.
==G: Do you have remote village?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  Cobbled street and remote village and the pyramid, they're all pretty well in line.
==F: Okay.
==G: So I want you to take that line, and continue it ... I ... another ... quarter of an inch, out past the {fp|er} bottom left of {ph|theee=the} pyramid ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  And then from there, take that line and and arc it ever so ... slightly, so that you come ... straight down south ... {ip|til=until} you get to the {fp|er} left ... side ... of {fp|er} remote village, the top ... part ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  And you're going to take that line and you're going to go ... directly underneath the word {ci|remote village} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You'll be about {fp|er} quarter of an inch away from the {fp|er} actual word ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and your finish line is about ... half an inch ... past that east side of remote village.  Actually where the {le|e} is in {ci|village} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: your finish line is about half an inch past that, about a quarter of an inch down.  Okay?
==F: Okay.
==G: All right.
==G: Okay, do you have a start?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: It's beside a burnt forest?
==F: Yes it is.
==G: {fp|Uh}, to the right of the ... or to the east of the burnt forest do you have a remote village?
==F: Say again.
==G: Do you ... To the east of a burnt forest do you have an {ab|ea} ... a remote village?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay, do you have {fp|uh} a ravine {br|south east=southeast} ... of the burnt forest?
==F: Yes I do.  And directly south I have carpenter's cottage.
==G: Carpenter's cottage.  Okay, do you have a {fp|uh} pine grove to the east of the ravine?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, do you have a concealed hideout to the south?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Now, do you have anything south of the pine grove?
==F: Avalanche.
==G: An avalanche?
==F: Yes.
==G: Is that {fp|uh} ... Would you say that's sort of to the southwest of the pine grove?
==F: Yeah, it's to the southeast of the pine grove.
==G: Southeast of the pine grove?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay now, do you have anything to the south of the avalanche?
==F: {fp|Uh}, concealed hideout.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a palm tree {ab|ba} beside crane bay?
==F: No I do not.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a pebbled shore?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Okay, so {ab|fro} ... Do you have anything to the {fp|uh} south ... west southwest of the burnt forest?
==F: West southwest?
==G: Yeah.
==F: I have tiled land.
==G: Okay, do you ...
==F: {fg|Oh}, excuse me!  Tilled land.
==G: Tilled land.  Do you have anything to the south?
==F: {fp|Uh}, of tilled land?
==G: Yeah.
==F: No.
==G: {ab|oka} ... Or of the burnt forest?
==F: I have carpenter's cottage to the south.
==G: Okay.  Okay ...
==F: Between tilled land and burnt forest.
==G: Yeah.  Okay, here we go, fast and furious.  So from your start ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Go ... in a southeasterly direction ... Go {fp|uh} about an inch and a half two inches so you're just from the start to past the letter {le|b}.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then go southwest for about ... {fp|uh} ... two and a half inches, passing on the left side of your carpenter's {fp|uh} whatever there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now your line should stop so you're just in line with the {fp|uh} ... or just above the {le|r} in {ci|ravine} ...
==F: The {le|r} in {ci|ravine}, yes.  Okay.
==G: Yeah.  Now take that over until you're about an inch and a half away from the {le|r} in {ci|ravine} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Take that over east, sorry.
==F: Okay.
==G: Now head ... northeast, up the left face of the ravine ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|til=until} you're just about half a centimetre over those two little birds that are ... flying there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Go east for about {fp|uh} ... {ph|mm-one=one} two ... about two and a half inches ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you should be {fp|uh} {br|i in=in} line with the top of those trees ...
==F: {ph|Aw} ...
==G: {fp|Uh}, the pine grove ...
==F: Pine grove!
==G: Yeah.  Do you have {ab|pi} ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: You have pine grove?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay.  Turn southeast ... and head directly towards the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove} passing off the left-hand side of the pine grove and you should stop {ab|y} when you're about half centimetre away from pine grove ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Now this is where it kind of gets {ab|c} ... This is the only little {fp|uh} {ab|g} {fp|uh} {ab|croo} crooked part about it but ... {ab|Y} ... Now you'll turn ... {fp|uh} a {ab|f} ... a sharper southeast in towards your avalanche, but then as you get close to it, turn away from it.  And the diameter that you're turning is about the size of a silver dollar ... And then as soon as you come out of that you're going to immediately ... turn away from the avalanche ... {fp|uh} ... and that diameter in is is about the size of a dime but you'll be passing over the top of the hideout or the concealed hideout ... You see what I'm ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You see what I'm saying there?
==F: So I go {ab|sou} ... I go southeast in a ... semi-circle fashion ...
==G: Yeah, southeast in a semi-circle ... You're going to turn southeast, and proceed in a semi-circle fashion ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: until you're coming out of your semi-circle and then you're going to turn into another reverse semi-circle ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then you're going to go over the top of the hideout ...
==F: Okay.
==G: around the right-hand side and underneath ... the {fp|uh} ... the concealed hideout.
==F: Okay.  I I see, yes ... Okay.
==G: Okay?  So where are you now?
==F: I'm underneath the {le|c} ...
==G: {fg|Ah} ...
==F: in {ci|concealed}.
==G: Okay, good.  Do you have a boathouse to your left?
==F: {fp|Uh}, I have a boathouse ... below ...
==G: {ab|Be} ...
==F: concealed hideout.
==G: Okay.  What you want to do is go ... approximately three-quarters of an inch past the letter {le|c} in {ci|concealed} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: or the first letter {ab|concea} ... or first letter {le|c} ... and stop.  You should be just past ... the {fp|uh} ... {fp|uh} {fp|um} ... Do you know where the little point is?
==F: Yes.  Yes.
==G: Yeah.  Above the letter {le|a}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: You should be just about half a centimetre past that.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, now what you're going to do is head ... Take your line straight down towards the bay ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you're going to follow along the shoreline heading sort of out ... {ab|y} ... The the shoreline part that's heading out into the bay.  But you're you're just going to follow {ph|thlong=along} the shoreline ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|Cl} ... Hug the shoreline really close, until you come out of {ab|tha} {fp|uh} out of that {fp|uh} area just above the letter {le|c} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Keep on hugging the shoreline heading down until you come ... {fp|uh} ... Do {ab|y} ... You have pebbled shore?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: You're going to pass ... You're going to take a {ab|l} {fp|uh} west turn, and you're going to pass off close to the top of pebbled shore ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, and then you're going to take ... Do you have anything {fp|uh} {ab|b} {fp|uh} below pebbled shore?
==F: Yes, I have washed stones.
==G: Washed stones.  Okay, what you're going to do is you're going to {ab|pa} ... Do you have anything {fp|uh} ... to the {fp|uh} northeast or to the west of {fp|uh} pebbled shore?
==F: To the west of pebbled shore?  No I do not.
==G: Okay.  What you're going to do is you're going to pass off to the left going down the left-hand side ... of {fp|uh} pebbled shore ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {fp|uh} for about three inches.  And then head ... You're going to take {fp|uh} ... You're going to pass down the left-hand side of {fp|uh} {ab|s} washed stones ... So you're going to go in another large {fp|uh} semi-circle fashion ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Now you see that inlet where the flagship is?
==F: Yes.
==G: About ... half an inch west from the centre of the inlet ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: there's {fp|uh} ... There's the finish mark there and that's where you're going to be heading.
==F: Half an inch ...
==G: In from the centre of the inlet.
==F: Okay.
==G: Or just down from the centre of the inlet.
==F: Okay.
==G: That's where you'll be heading.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay? Got it?
==F: Got it.
==G: Okay, Mark!
==F: Okay, Joe!
==G: Above camera shop!
==F: Beautiful!
==G: You have start line?
==F: Yes!
==G: Okay!  Below camera shop you have parked van?
==F: I have nothing.
==G: You have what?
==F: Nothing.
==G: You have nothing.  Okay!  To {ph|thiii=the} east ... southeast of camera shop you have allotments?
==F: Yes.
==G: Okay.  Parked van ... is directly below camera shop, slightly offset east.  Approximately ... three inches.
==F: Three inches below?
==G: {ab|T} yeah ... Three inches below.
==F: Okay.
==G: And allotments of course {fp|uh} ... is no more than two inches above parked van.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  I want you to take the line and go ... on the west side of camera shop ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: straight down, missing the {le|c} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: going down for about ... {fg|ooh} five inches ...
==F: Okay.
==G: until you're about two inches from the top of ... the bottom of the page ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then I want you to take the line and arc it down ... so you're going east ...
==F: Okay.
==G: for about {fp|uh} two inches. Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: So you ... So you ... So the line stops {ab|w} ... Actually you'll be past the camera shop.
==F: Just a little bit past the camera shop?
==G: Yeah, just a ... just {ab|bi} past the the camera shop.
==F: And I'm under the van?  I'm south of the van now?
==G: That's right.  You're south of the van.
==F: Okay.  Good.
==G: Now you're going to go straight north ... over the top left-hand edge of allotments, the little barn or shack there.
==F: Going up on the left?
==G: That's right.  You know, arc the line ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, so you're at the {fp|uh} ... top edge of the barn ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now to the right of allotments do you have anything there?
==F: Got a yacht club right in the eastern edge of the page, and I've got a flight museum northeast.
==G: Okay.
==F: Of allotments.
==G: So, {ab|yo} you have abandoned monastery?
==F: No.
==G: {fg|Oh}, you don't?
==F: {fg|Oh}, yes I do.  Sorry.
==G: Okay, you do.
==F: That's {fp|uh} ... up north of west lake.  In that area?
==G: {fg|Uh}, okay.  Now.  Below ...
==F: Just sort of ...
==G: Below abandoned monastery {ab|W} {ab|d} {fp|uh} do you have anything?
==F: {fg|Uh}, {br|f flight=flight} museum.
==G: Flight museum.  Is that {fp|uh} parallel?  I mean is {ab|tha} ... is that in line with {ab|mon} abandoned monastery?  Or slightly offset in? Or out?
==F: It's only about half as wide as the abandoned monastery.
==G: Okay.
==F: Takes up the {fp|uh} ... from the centre towards the eastern edge of the abandoned monastery.
==G: Okay, so ... going back to allotments, do you have anything to the right of allotments?
==F: {fp|Uh} no.  The the flight museum is about two and a half inches northeast of the allotments.
==G: Two and a half ... Okay.  I want you to take that line ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: go diagonally ... on an angle of about {fp|uh} {ph|fff} no more than five {ph|sssix=six} degrees ... and go underneath the flight line ... until you come to the {fp|uh} right-hand edge of abandoned monastery if you draw an imaginary line down ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  If you draw a {ab|ma} an imaginary line at the top of allotments {ab|acr} straight across ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: your ... arc ... the line should be no more than ... {fp|uh} ... three-quarters of an inch.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, now you stop at the edge, of abandoned {br|mo monastery=monastery}.
==F: Okay, you want me to bring it up to the monastery?
==G: {ab|Ye} ... no no no no.  Just just ... that diagonal line ...
==F: Okay.
==G: across to the ... you know the the east edge ... but but you know but below abandoned monastery just {fp|uh} {ab|y} {fp|uh} {ab|y} ...
==F: I am below the flight museum.
==G: That's right.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now.  From there, you're going to take that line and go ... directly north, over abandoned monastery ... being careful not to touch anything ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: So ...
==G: You're going {ab|straigh} ... You're going due north now.
==F: Yeah.  Due north until I'm at ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: the upper {fp|uh} corner of abandoned monastery?
==G: Yeah, on the {fp|uh} left {ab|si} ... {ab|actua} ... Know where the {fp|uh} ...
==F: Okay.  So I'm going right over top of the monastery?
==G: Right over top of it.
==F: Okay.
==G: You know where the {le|a} is?
==F: Yeah.
==G: There's {fp|uh} some little {fp|uh} ...
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: rectangle above that?
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay, that that ... Okay, that's where your line stops.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now, you have alpine garden?
==F: Yes.
==G: Anything below that?
==F: West lake.
==G: West lake.  Okay.  Where you stopped the line at abandoned mine ... you're going to take that line, you're going to arc it down ... {ph|sssouthwest=southwest} about {fp|uh} two inches ...
==F: Okay.  So it would be at the shore of the lake?
==G: That's right but {ab|yo} {ab|y} you're going to miss the lake.  You're going to go at the bottom of the shore of the lake ... Okay, you'll be at the bottom of the lake ... You're going to arc the line ...
==F: At the ... What do you mean the bottom of the lake?
==G: Okay.  Where's where's the lake in relation to the abandoned monastery? Are they {fp|uh} parallel?  I mean, are they in line with each other?
==F: {fg|Oh}, you don't ... {fg|Oh} sorry, you don't have the lake on?
==G: No, I don't.
==F: Okay, if I ... If I take my line, like two inches southwest from ... that corner of the monastery I'm at ... {ph|thiii=the} {fp|uh} northeastern corner of the lake.
==G: Okay.  A a {ab|b} a better reference ... Use use the alpine garden. Going down from there ...
==F: Okay, {fp|uh} ... The lake ... The north shore of the lake is two inches ... south of the alpine garden.
==G: Okay.  Two inches?  Okay.
==F: Okay.  The entire north shore of the lake, without getting into all the fine details, is about three inches long and it's on a slight {fp|um} ... {ph|tchew} ...
==G: Okay.
==F: northwesterly angle.
==G: Okay.  Okay, okay.  Where the word {ci|abandoned monastery} is ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, now you take that line and you're going to arc it down so you're no more than about half an inch away from the {le|a} ... where the line ... {ab|wher} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {ab|wher} where the arc line stops.  Okay?
==F: Yeah.
==G: So from there on, just continue that line ... {fp|uh} in in in in line with the {fp|uh} the word {ci|abandoned monastery} and go across about {fp|uh} ... two inches ... and you'll be at the left-hand edge of alpine garden ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, from there you're going to go due north, up the left-hand edge of alpine garden ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  You're going to go over top of {ph|alpime=alpine} garden. You ...
==F: Okay.
==G: you're now going east, for about an inch ...
==F: Over {fg|eh} ... Going west?
==G: No, you're you're going east. You're going east now.  Stop there.  You you ...
==F: When I went across the top of the alpine garden I thought I went up ... I thought I went up the eastern edge.
==G: Yeah, right across the top of {ab|alpi} alpine garden.  Okay.  You're going east.  Okay, do you have a youth hostel?
==F: Okay.  Hold on.
==G: {fg|Oh}, okay.
==F: When I went from the abandoned monastery, did I go up the western hand edge of the alpine garden?
==G: That is right.
==F: Okay.  I went up the east side.
==G: {fg|Oh} you do ... {fg|Oh} okay, I'm sorry there.  Okay.
==F: Okay.
==G: You're going up ... Yeah, that's right the ...
==F: I'm now going east.
==G: Okay.  About three-quarters of the way into alpine garden top, okay, stop there.  Okay, do you have a youth hostel.
==F: No.
==G: You don't, {fg|eh}?  Okay, the youth hostel ... is directly ... northeast of alpine garden.
==F: Okay.
==G: It's no more than an inch ... from the {fp|uh} ... between {fp|uh} the word {ci|youth hostel} and the top of alpine garden.  {ab|Y} there's no more than an inch separating them.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now where you ... Where you are there, where you've stopped with that line, go directly north ... for about two inches ...
==F: From the edge of alpine garden?
==G: That's right.
==F: Yeah.  Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now, from there you're going to ... you're going to go directly east ... over the top of youth hostel for about {fp|uh} an inch and a half.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Telephone box?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  From the top of where you stopped, to the {le|t} in {ci|telephone box} draw a line connecting those two points.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Now from the {le|t}, take the line and go {ab|d} {fp|uh} go go beneath telephone box ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Being ... {fp|uh} {ab|y} {ab|y} actually very close to the words ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: To the {le|x} in {ci|box}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Stop there and go north about {fp|uh} an inch and a half.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now you have {ab|h} thatched hut {fp|uh} mudhat?
==F: No.
==G: You don't, {fg|eh}?  Okay.  You know east lake?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Take a line and and divide it in half ...
==F: Okay.
==G: An imaginary line.
==F: Okay, like in half north south?
==G: Okay, thatched ... If ... Okay, thatched hut ... is approximately ... an inch and a half ... in, to east lake, if you draw an imaginary line. You know, offset into it?  To {ab|ju} ... But below it.  It's about {fp|uh} an inch and a half below east lake ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And about an inch and a half ... into east lake.  Okay, {ab|no} ... the finish line ... Go to east lake.  Go along the south shore, {ip|til=until} you come to a {fp|uh} ... a little bay, just where it juts up north ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  From there, go out about an ... half an inch ... That's your finish line right there ...
==F: Half an inch west?
==G: Yes.  Half an inch west.  That's your finish line right there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay.  Now, {br|w working=working} backwards now, take your line and go ... directly along the south shore of east lake about {fp|uh} where ... yeah ... it dissects to the centre ...
==F: Okay.
==G: You know where the {fp|uh} {le|t} is in {ci|east lake}?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Actually the {le|l} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Your line ... Where you stop should be {fp|uh} pretty well {fp|uh} {fp|eh} in line with that.  Now you're going to take that line and go directly north ... {fp|ah} {ab|sou} directly south ... about {fp|uh} two inches ... Okay, you know where the {fp|uh} the telephone box is, where the {le|x} is?
==F: Yes.
==G: Where the line stopped above that telephone box ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Just connect those lines there.  And that's your ... That should lead you to the finish line.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?
==F: Sure.
==G: The {le|t} ... Okay.  {fp|Uh}, I ... Yeah, I think you've got it.
==G: All right, {fp|erm}, starting point's top, left-hand corner.
==F: Okay.
==G: You got a burnt forest?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Remote village?
==F: A what?

==F: No.
==G: Pebbled shore?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, and you have crane bay, right?
==F: Yeah, and I also have {fp|erm} ...
==G: Flagship?
==F: Washed ... Yeah.  I have {fp|er} ... a thing called {ci|washed stones} between flagship and pebbled shore.  {ph|Kkk} ... It's {fp|erm} two fingers away from that dip, above the ship ... to the west.
==G: {ph|Mmkay=Okay}.  All right.  Come down the west side, towards towards the {le|b} in {ci|burnt} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then ... do a little hook.  I don't know if there's ... Do you have something there?
==F: Yeah.  I have a carpenter's cottage.
==G: Okay.  Go {ab|ar} ... to the east around ... your cottage there ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then ... swing back down.  And then ... You have something else down here?
==F: Yeah.  It's called {ci|tilled land}.
==G: Tilled land?  {fp|Erm} ... {ph|pu-tu-tuu} ... Go ... around it, down to the bottom of it.
==F: Okay.  So, you just want me to go down the {br|l left=left} hand side of the ravine ...
==G: Yeah.  And then around in front ... of your {fp|er} cottage or whatever it is.  And then go between it and the ravine ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then ...
==F: {ab|Ar} ...
==G: turn east and go under ... remote village ...
==F: Hold on.  I don't have ...
==G: {gg|Oh}, you don't have a remote village, do you?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Erm} ...
==F: You want me to go round my tilled land, you said.  Right?
==G: Tilled {ab|lan} ... How far down's your tilled land?
==F: {fp|Erm}, it starts at three fingers down from the carpenter's cottage ...
==G: Okay.  No.  I don't want you to go round ... there.
==F: {ab|Ok} ... Okay.  Just go underneath the ravine, then?
==G: No, no.  I said, go under your cottage ... and go between your cottage and the ravine.  Go up ... Go up in between those two ... and then go underneath the remote village.  But you don't have the remote village. {ph|tu-tu-tuu} ... It's {fp|er} ...
==F: {gg|Oh} ...
==G: Draw a line ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I got you.
==G: one finger-width ... just to above ... the ravine there ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then just go straight across towards the tips of {fp|er} the the pine grove ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and then go down the west sides of those ... And then you go around something.  I don't know what that is.
==F: {fp|Er}, it's my avalanche site.
==G: Okay.  {ph|Gooo=Go} to the {ab|ea} ... around it to the east ... And then ... Do you have something else there too?
==F: Just a concealed hideout, it's called.
==G: Okay.  Well go down around ... {fg|Oh}, wait a minute. Where's your {fp|um} ... your thing in relationship to the grove?  Your pine grove.
==F: It's {fp|erm} to the east ... {fp|er} two fingers, and it starts at two fingers down ... and it's about three fingers wide.
==G: {fp|Erm}, where is it, like?  Is it right underneath the pine grove?
==F: No.  It's {fp|er} off to the ...
==G: To the west?
==F: to the east.
==G: Okay.  Go ...
==F: See where the {le|e} is, in {ci|grove}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: If you go down three fingers, that's where the start of it begins.  And it goes over ...
==G: To the west.  Okay.  Just go around that.  Around ... the concealed hideout ... towards the boathouse ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {gg|Oh}, wait a minute!  You don't have the boathouse up by the concealed hideout, do you?
==F: {fp|Erm}, mine's ...
==G: Down to the right.
==F: Is it ... Is it in crane bay, sort of?
==G: No.
==F: The {le|b} in {ci|crane} ... Okay.  I have a boathouse ... you know ... {fp|um} ... the far right-hand side of crane bay, where it goes off the paper.
==G: Yeah.  Yeah.  No, {ab|I} ... This one isn't.
==F: Or ...
==G: Okay.  It's {fp|er} ... two fingers, okay, to the ... rightmost point ... right above {le|a} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: in {ci|bay}.  Okay.  Go two fingers directly above that ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Draw the line to there, and then head directly south.  And then follow that dip around in the bay ...
==F: Okay.  So I'm going to go right under concealed hideout ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: like ...
==G: One ... {ip|bout=about} one finger width past the {le|c} ... and then head straight down to that point ... right above {fp|er} the bay there. And then follow that little ravine there, the cut ... in the bay.
==F: Okay.  So the second point, I go right to it, almost?
==G: Yeah.
==F: But don't ...
==G: Go over it.  And then, underneath the palm tree ...
==F: I don't have a palm tree.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Er}, right ... Do you have a pebbled shore?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Just hug real close to the pebbled shore without touching it.
==F: On what side?
==G: {fp|Er}, the north side.  Go around it ... and then ...
==F: So go over the top of it?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ph|Mmkay=Okay}.  And then {fp|er} ... Do you have something else down here?
==F: Yeah.  It's called {ci|washed stones}.
==G: Okay.  Go around it, to the west ... and then ... {fp|er} one finger ... width from the shoreline there, in front of your flagship ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Draw an {le|x} and that's your finish line.
==F: Okay.  Finished.
==G: Okay.  You have your {le|x} above the camp, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  You want to go straight left, for about ... centimetre and a half.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Then you're going to {ph|llloop=loop} down, to a point ... parallel to the words {ci|missionary camp} ... and about ... three centimetres over.  And on your way down you're going to pass {ip|bout=about} half a centimetre away from the missionary camp. Tent.
==F: All right.
==G: So you're going to loop down a half centimetre away from the tent and start to be parallel.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Crossing towards the missionary camp. Okay, from there ... You have a banana tree in the left-hand corner?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.
==F: Below the writing?
==G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre below the writing.
==F: All right.
==G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.
==F: Under the leaf?
==G: {fp|Uh} {ph|bii} {ph|puh} right underneath the {ab|t} base of the tree.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  Now what we're going to do is we're going to circle around the left-hand edge of the trees, up and across the river.  So what we're going to do is we're going to stay about a half a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the tree ...
==F: All right.
==G: And we're going to move up and we're going to go {ph|thththrough=through} the bridge, like across the bridge.
==F: The rope bridge?
==G: Yeah.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, so stay a half a centimetre away from the tree and gently loop up {fg|aw} it's about six seven centimetres ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: And then gradually ... turn to the right, right through the rope bridge.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay and when you get to the other side ... you're going to {ab|co} ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: You're going to come out about a half a centimetre ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: And then you're going to go down about a centimetre ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  And now ... Do you have anything left of the waterfall?
==F: No I don't.
==G: Okay.  We're going to go ... to a point ... I'm {ab|go} ... like, I'm going to give you a point and tell you where to go.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, it's about five centimetres to the right of where we are now ...
==F: All right.
==G: And about a half a centimetre above that.
==F: All right.
==G: It's ... It's on the left-hand side of the waterfall there.
==F: Yeah.
==G: We're going to go to there.  Just {ab|ea} ... gently ease up there ...
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, now we're about a half a {ab|c} ... well, maybe a quarter centimetre away from the left-hand edge of the top of the waterfall.
==F: {ip|Bout=About} a centimetre away, you said?
==G: {ip|Bout=About} a half a centimetre.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, and then we're going to go straight up, keeping about half a centimetre away from the waterfall, up to ... third ... what are they, marked {ci|pillars} on yours?
==F: Fallen pillars?
==G: Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to go straight up to there, {ip|til=until} we're about ... and keep about a half a centimetre away from them on the right ... until you're right at the top of them, and then stop there.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay, are you still on the right-hand side?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  What we're going to do is we're going to loop over top of them, and ... Do you {ab|ha} ... Do you {ab|ha} ... Do you have {br|f fallen=fallen} pillars?  Off to the left?
==F: {fp|Uh} that's like {fp|uh} what I'm at right now.  I have ... Fallen pillars is where I am.
==G: Okay, {ab|wh} what do you have to the right of there?
==F: To the right of fallen pillars?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Empty space.
==G: You don't have anything to the right of fallen pillars?
==F: Nothing at all. Should there be pillars there?
==G: I have lost steps, straight above the waterfall and to the left.
==F: No.
==G: Okay, we're going to backtrack.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay. Back to where we were below the waterfall?
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: We're going to go straight up ... about eight centimetres.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, then we're going to ... gradually turn to the left ... and we're going to go ... go up another half a centimetre ...
==F: All right.
==G: And then ease your way over to the left, about four centimetres away.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, now we're going to start to {ab|g} ... turn down again ... and the next turning point, from where we are, is about ... one centimetre to the left, and about two centimetres down.  So that's the next turning point, just gradually ease your way to that point.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, and then we're going to go ... straight left, below the fallen pillars about ... close to a centimetre below the word {ci|fallen pillars} ...
==F: All right.
==G: Parallel to there, to {fp|uh} just left of the word {ci|fallen} ... all right, left of the {le|f} and we'll stop there.
==F: All right.  I'm there.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} ... {ph|tschew} ... Do you have anything below that?
==F: {fp|Uh} {ab|fall} {fp|uh} flamingoes is down and {fp|uh} ...
==G: To the left?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, we're going to go around them.  Below them.
==F: All right.
==G: So just ... I {ab|g} ...
==F: Make a {le|u} underneath?
==G: Yeah.  Just make a big {le|u} and stay about a half a centimetre away from them.
==F: All right.
==G: And then ...
==F: {ab|Clear} ...
==G: Come up until ... {fp|uh} ... {ab|y} ... Well, just make a little {le|u}, until you're straight across from where we are now.
==F: Yeah.  That's where I am.
==G: Okay.  Now we're going to ... You have ancient ruins or, what is it, just ...
==F: Ruined city?
==G: Ruined city, yeah.  Okay, same thing.  We're going to ease up to there and stay about a half a centimetre off to the left-hand side, and just ease up to the ancient ruins.
==F: That's ruined city, right?
==G: Ruined city, yeah, sorry.
==F: All right ... I'm there.
==G: Okay, what point are you at?  At the ruined city?
==F: I'm at the very left-hand side approximately ...
==G: Okay.
==F: halfway up the ruined city.
==G: Okay.  You're going to ... See that dark ... the very dark shaded-in ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: section?  We got to go straight above that, about a centimetre.  So just stay half a centimetre away and go up about a centimetre above that.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Do ... You don't have stones at the top of the page, do you?
==F: I have rock fall?
==G: Okay.  Or, wait, is that the mountain?
==F: I have white mountain.
==G: And to the {ab|le} ... straight above the the ruined city?
==F: Straight above it I have nothing, but off to about one, one o'clock, two o'clock maybes, a rock fall.
==G: Okay.  All right.  Looks like we're going to have to go ... {ab|ar} ... on top of that and to the right.  So we're going to go up about ... five centimetres straight up.
==F: From where I am now?
==G: Yeah.
==F: One two three four five.
==G: And will you pass over top of the rock fall now?
==F: {fp|Uh} no, I'm just coming up to the bottom of it.
==G: Okay, it's marked on mine {ci|stones}.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, so we're going to turn below them about a half a centimetre away and go straight, to ... over to the right about ... okay, about {ph|ffff} five centimetres.  To the ... And then we're going to be at the base of the mountain there?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, stay about a half a centimetre away from that, and ... go all the way round it to the other side.  Above it.
==F: Of what?
==G: The mountain.
==F: Go ... So go around the left?
==G: Yeah.  Go over top of the mountain.  Staying about a half a centimetre away.
==F: All right.
==G: And then when you get to the very bottom right-hand corner of of the the mountain ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: We're going to start to turn left again.
==F: All right.
==G: And I ... I have a thing called biggest furniture store.
==F: No.
==G: Do you have gazelles?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, about five centimetres above that I have a big furniture store, {ab|bi} the {fp|uh} furniture store.
==F: All right.
==G: So we have to stay about ... a centimetre and a half below the word {ci|white mountain}.  And you're going to turn to the left and go parallel to that.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  And you stop about ... half a centimetre left of the {ph|ber} very bottom left-hand corner of the mountain ... Just below that, like, that far to the left.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, and then go down about ten centimetres, straight down ... to the bottom of gazelles ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Turn to the right and stay about a half a centimetre below the word {ci|gazelles}.  And go for about another four centimetres, to the right ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Mark an {le|x}.  That's the finish.
==F: All right.
==G: All right.  Right above the diamond mine ...
==F: {ph|Aaayym=I'm} there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, on the west side ... just one centimetre away from the ... diamond mine, do a gentle arc all the way down until you're about a half a centimetre underneath the {le|d} in {ci|diamond}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Move along to the east ... keeping half a centimetre under the writing of {ci|diamond mine} until you stop at the {le|e}. ... In {ci|mine}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  To your east do you have a wagon wheel?
==F: {fp|Er}, I do not. I have a cactus.  And a rift valley.
==G: All right.  Here's what I want you to do.  Go ... at a very ... gentle ... upward ... slope ...
==F: From where I am?
==G: From where you are.
==F: Okay.
==G: Very gentle.  But I want you to go more east.  East about ... five centimetres, up one centimetre. {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ph|aye=are} you {ph|rat=at} ... Are you at the ...
==F: Okay.  So I'm going up ... Okay.  From the diamond mine, I'm going up one centimetre and over five?
==G: Yeah.  But you're going over five first and then up one.  So it's a very gentle ... slope ...
==F: I don't ... I'm not getting that. I'm not understanding that part.
==G: All right.  From the diamond mind ...
==F: Yes.  I'm at the {le|e} ... in  {ci|diamond mine}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to go ... north ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Correction!  We're going to go east five centimetres.
==F: From diamond mine?
==G: From the diamond mine.
==F: {ph|Sss} continuing the straight line?
==G: Just go straight, east.
==F: Okay.  One two three four five.  I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go ... north ... four centimetres ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you've got your cactus and your rift valley?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to do a gentle arc over top of the cactus ... and straight down the middle of rift valley.
==F: Until I hit the {ci|cactus}, {ab|l} ... the {ab|r} ... the lettering?
==G: {fp|Er}, no, you go right over top of the cactus and you just stop right in the middle ... where it ... the sandy part of the rift valley is ...
==F: Okay.  So I'm not going anywhere close to the ... cactus at all, then?
==G: No, you're going right over top of it.
==F: Okay.  I'm here.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, underneath the rift valley do you have two rocks?
==F: {fp|Er}, yes I do.
==G: All right.  I want you to go straight down ... five centimetres ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: towards the large rock.
==F: {ph|Ooookay=Okay}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a stony creek?
==F: {ph|Nnnnnno=No} I do not.  But I have rapids.
==G: But you do have a waterfall?
==F: I have a rapids to my left.  Left of the rocks.
==G: All right.  What ...
==F: {ip|Bout=About} ten centimetres.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, take a look at the little rocks, or the rocks.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Go to the ... west of the rock.  You see a little tiny square?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Go right or {fp|er} ... left, two centimetres ...
==F: Of that rock?
==G: Of that little tiny square.
==F: Left two centimetres.
==G: Mark that point and draw a straight line from there ... all the way up to where ... I last left you.
==F: I'm there.
==G: All right.  Now I want you to make a gentle, downward bow shape.  So with ... The bow is going to go ... bend towards the south.  It just goes down one centimetre ... and then it rises back up, and the bow has to be a total of four centimetres long. ... So you got that? You're doing a gentle downward bow ...
==F: About four centimetres and then ... continuing up towards the rapids?
==G: {ab|We} ... It's one centimetre down ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: but it goes along ... to the west, a total of four centimetres. So that you stop ... just to the ... east of the ... {fp|er} ... white water or in your case the rapids.
==F: Okay, can you give me that one more time, please?
==G: Okay.
==F: We're at {ab|th} ... I'm at the square of the rocks.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're at the square of the rocks?
==F: Yes.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, can you see the white water or your rapids?
==F: My rapids are on my left side, ten centimetres over ... from the rocks.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you ... to ... You got to {ab|g} go towards the rapids but you have to make a gentle ... bend ... You know what a happy face looks like?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Make a happy face from the ...
==F: From the point I'm at ...
==G: to ...
==F: to the rapids, make a {ab|p} ... make a happy face?
==G: to the upper part, northernmost ... point ... on the east side of the {ab|r} {fp|er} {ab|wh} ... rapids.
==F: All right.  No problem then. ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm there.
==G: All right.  Do a gentle, upward arc around ... the ... rapids, going to the west ...
==F: Okay.
==G: keeping a half centimetre away.
==F: Okay.
==G: Do you have a ... item below the rapids?
==F: I have a manned fort.  And that's all I have.
==G: All right.  Here's what I want you to do.  Go ... south, in a gentle arc, and go all the way around ... the fort, at the bottom, and stop at the gate.
==F: Left side of the fort?
==G: Yes, you'd be on the left side of the fort.
==F: Okay. ... Am I keeping half a centimetre distance from the fort?
==G: Yeah.  That'd be good.
==F: {ph|Aaaaaand=And} until I reach a {ab|le} ... the lettering?
==G: {fp|Er}, the lettering or where the door is.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: All right. ... You have stone slabs to your east, but you ... And do you have a hideout ... also to the ... northeast?
==F: Yes I do.  Outlaws' ...
==G: It would ... might be a cave.
==F: Yes I do. Outlies ... Outlaws' hideout and stone slabs.
==G: All right.  Reference where I {ph|laft=last} ... last left you ...
==F: Yes.
==G: Draw ... a straight line to the {le|o} in the {ci|outlaw} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and stay about ...
==F: So that's curving upwards?
==G: It's curving upwards.
==F: Okay.
==G: Stay about ... half a centimetre under the {ab|out} ... the {ab|w} writing.
==F: I've reached the {le|o} in {ci|outlaws'}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}. Draw the line straight across until you hit the {le|t} ...
==F: Okay, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do a gentle, downward arc ... until you're about a half a centimetre away from the edge of the page ...
==F: Downwards where?
==G: So you're going east.
==F: Half a centimetres away from the page. Okay, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a noose, underneath you?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Just go straight down until you're at the ... until you're at the bottom of the {fp|er} wood {ph|scapuvilling=scaffolding} ... Actually, make it the {le|e}.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you ...
==F: Am I keeping a distance?
==G: Say again.
==F: Am I keeping any distance?
==G: {fp|Erm} ... keep about ... fairly close to the edge and about a {ab|ha} {fg|er} one centimetre away from the {fp|er} wood {ph|scaffling=scaffolding}.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: All right.  Do you have a {ab|s} a pond?
==F: {fp|Er}, I have a stone creek.  To the left of my slabs, {fp|er} three centimetres down.
==G: {gg|Hmmm}.
==F: {ip|Bout=About} five centimetres over from my stone slabs and {ab|thr} about three centimetres down, I have a stone creek.
==G: Okay.  We want to go {ab|ar} ... Arc down ...
==F: From where my ...
==G: {ab|S} ...
==F: From the noose?
==G: From where I left you, you have to go ... {fp|er} ... southwest, down {br|gent ly=gently} ... until you're underneath the ... {fp|er} noose, you're about five centimetres underneath the noose.
==F: I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not one centimetres away from the noose?
==G: No.  You're about ...
==F: Five centimetres.
==G: five centimetres down.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Then you go ...
==F: Is that over the writing?  {ci|Quad two}?
==G: Yes.  You'd be over top of the writing.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now go ... straight west, for about a centimetre, and then you {ab|sh} {fp|er} ... directly in front of that should be your object, right?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.
==F: I have no objects there.
==G: Okay.  Now I want you to go ... Remember how we did a happy face?
==F: Yes we did.
==G: I want to make a frown.  It's got to have ...
==F: From where it says {ci|follower} make a frown?
==G: Right where I left you?
==F: Yes.
==G: You're right above the {fp|er} {le|q} in the {fp|er} {ci|quadrant two}?
==F: Okay then.
==G: About two centimetres above it?
==F: {ph|Nnno=No}.
==G: The frown has to be a total of five centimetres ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And it's got to have a ... {fp|er} a two ... centimetre ... frown, you know? So ...
==F: Two centimetres tall?
==G: Two centimetres tall.
==F: But four centimetres wide.
==G: Four centimetres wide ...
==F: Okay.
==G: two centimetres tall.
==F: Okay, and do that right now?  New problem!  That's done.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Reference the saloon ...
==F: Yes?
==G: You want to do a gentle curve until you come underneath the {le|r}.
==F: I'm underneath it.
==G: Go straight to the {le|s}.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Reference the peak of the {fp|er} saloon ... Go four centimetres to your left ...
==F: From ... from where the {le|s} is?
==G: No.  {ab|Fr} ... Okay.  {ab|G} Look at the top of the {fp|er} ...
==F: I seen it.
==G: saloon ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: Four centimetres straight left?
==F: One two three four.  Seen.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Then draw from the {le|s} all the way up to that ... point, in a gentle arc, and that's the finish.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: All right.  Done!
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, Marcus, your start.  Do you have the site of the forest fire?
==F: I've got it.
==G: Okay, go to {ph|thuuh=the} west of that, leave yourself half an inch. Do you have the picnic site?
==F: {fp|Uh} no.  Got a playground.
==G: Okay, I ...
==F: Right underneath it, to the {fp|uh} southeast.
==G: Okay, you need to go {ph|st-t-t} {fp|uh} ... leave yourself half a an inch on {le|s} ...
==F: On on the {ph|sssite=site} of ...
==G: {ph|Ss} of forest fire.
==F: Okay, so I'm doing {ph|ayy=a} a doughnut here?
==G: Yeah, what you want to do though ... Wait.
==F: Yeah?
==G: Is go ... a full hand including your thumb straight south.
==F: Got it.  I'm there, so I'm about {fp|uh} a finger from the bottom of the page?
==G: {ab|Y} actually you can leave it two fingers.
==F: All right, I'm there.
==G: Okay, go to the {ph|thuuh=the} ... the stool of picnic site, go around that way, the anti-clockwise doughnut ...
==F: Okay, I'm not ... I don't have a picnic site.
==G: You don't have the picnic site?
==F: No.
==G: {fg|Oh} you don't?  Okay.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have an adventure playground?
==G: Yeah I do.  What you want to do is {fp|uh} ...
==F: The doughnut where?
==G: go go straight up that way.  You want to be on the left-hand side of the adventure playground ...
==F: Right, but I got to do a doughnut, right?
==G: Leave your ... Yeah.  Leave yourself like half a finger to the west of the cage ...
==F: All right, in {ab|m} ... I'm there.
==G: Okay.
==F: I'm up by the cage.
==G: Okay, right.  Go straight across east {ip|til=until} you hit {le|d} ...
==F: Am I underneath it or above it?
==G: You're above the playground.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay.
==F: Let's rock!
==G: What do you have ... What do you have that's like {fp|uh} ...
==F: I got ... to ...
==G: northeast of that?
==F: Northeast is a private owned field.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} reference the granite quarry ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, leave yourself half an inch ... {fp|uh} to the east of that ...
==F: To the east of the granite {ab|quar} ... Yeah.
==G: Use that as kind of your reference to judge how far to go east and then go straight up and around.
==F: I got to be around the private owned fields, all right?
==G: Yeah, go around that to your ... right.
==F: To my east, right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Half a finger from the {le|s}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm going ... Now I'm heading north?
==G: Yeah, go straight up around the granite quarry, just leave yourself {fp|uh} ... You're going around the east side ...
==F: {ab|Y} ...
==G: up over top.
==F: All right, I'm over top now.
==G: Okay.  You see the ... Do you have the train crossing?
==F: No I don't.  I have a waterfall.  {fg|Oh}, I have a train crossing way up top.
==G: Okay, don't worry about it, there's a second one.
==F: Right.
==G: What you want to do is ... Leave yourself half an inch and go underneath the waterfall and up the waterfall.  To the west.
==F: All right, so {fp|uh} I can go straight between the granite quarry and the waterfall, right?
==G: That's right, stay closer to the waterfall.
==F: I'm up at the top of the waterfall.
==G: Okay, leave yourself half an inch ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and ... You have something to the northeast of waterfall?
==F: Right, I do.  Am I going over or under?
==G: You're going over it.  So ...
==F: To the east?  So I'm I'm heading east?
==G: That's right.
==F: Over top?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Right.
==G: Go over top ...
==F: I'm over top.
==G: Okay, do you have the fallen ...
==F: Yeah, I got it.
==G: cairn?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Draw yourself a forty-five degree angle going southeast, straight underneath the fallen cairn ...
==F: Okay, I'm underneath it right now and I'm heading ...
==G: Okay, what you want to ... Do you have the limestone cliffs?
==F: {ab|Ye} {fp|uh} ... No I don't.
==G: {ab|Oka} ...
==F: I've got lion country.
==G: What do you have?
==F: Lion country. ... It's just {fp|uh} east of {fp|uh} east or it's just south of east lake.
==G: Yeah, okay.  All right.  I guess that's the same thing then.
==F: What is yours called?
==G: Limestone cliffs.  Do you have cliffs there?
==F: No I don't have cliffs.  Where are the cliffs again?
==G: Okay, I think ... You see the ... eastmost south portion of the east lake?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Directly underneath that.
==F: No I don't have them.
==G: Okay.
==F: Am I going in between them?
==G: Yeah, you're going in between, so stay closer to your ...
==F: Got it.
==G: {fp|uh} {ab|thi} ...
==F: And where ... And whereabouts at the cornfield? ... {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm in between them now, I've done a doughnut and I ...
==G: Okay, leave yourself half an inch, {ab|t} go straight up to east lake ...
==F: Yeah, I'm at east lake now.
==G: Okay.  You see the west ... the farthest westmost south tip?
==F: Yeah.  I'm there.
==G: Put one finger ... west ...
==F: Yeah?
==G: Draw an {le|x}.  We're done.
==F: Done.  Let's go.
==G: That's perfect.
==G: Okay Mark, do you have {ph|thuuh=the} crest falls?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, go down to {le|c} ...
==F: {fp|Uh}, right or ... or east or west?
==G: West side.
==F: Okay, I'm there.
==G: Do you see where ... Do you have baboons?
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.
==G: It's up a bit ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
==G: on the left side.
==F: {fp|Uh}, no.
==G: You still don't?  Okay.  Take a full hand ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: {fp|uh} and {ph|gooo=go} directly west of crest falls.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, straight across?
==G: Straight across.
==F: Done.  I got a banana tree there.
==G: Yeah, I figured you had something.  Do you have a footbridge?
==F: Yeah.  Go up into the footbridge?
==G: Yeah, go {ph|gnthg} go {fp|uh} ...
==F: {ab|Alri} ...
==G: go right to the end of it on the east side ...
==F: The east side?
==G: Yeah, go right over top ...
==F: Okay, I don't go around the banana tree?
==G: Yeah, go right around it.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, to the west though, right?
==G: To the west, that's right.
==F: Right, and then I go over to the east?  Yeah, I'm at the {ab|footbri} ...
==G: Yeah, across the footbridge.  Do you have the poisoned stream?
==F: {fp|Uh} no.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is, is as soon as you get to the ... end of the footbridge, come two fingers directly south ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Do you have the old temple?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {ab|g} {fp|uh} go right to the west side of the old temple and go up ...
==F: Now, I go south two fingers first?
==G: Yeah, go south two fingers to avoid the poisoned stream.
==F: Yeah, and then I go where?
==G: Go across ... to the old temple.  Leave yourself half an inch on the west side.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay?  Do you have the abandoned truck?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... go directly north on the west side of the old temple ... Go one finger north ... of the abandoned truck ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I've a got a mountain there.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is go over top of that mountain and {ab|undernea} ...
==F: And get over to the truck?
==G: and underneath the truck.
==F: Over and under ... All right, I'm under the ... and I'm over ... I'm at ... the {le|a} in {ci|abandoned}.
==G: Okay, perfect.  What you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ... half a finger west ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: you need to come down another ... three fingers, underneath ... what I have as baboons.
==F: Okay, and that'll take me just about to where I run into the line for the footbridge, right?
==G: Yeah, almost.  Maybe a finger?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, what you want to do then is ... {fp|Uh}, you have white mountain?
==F: Yeah.  And go up the side of white mountain?
==G: Okay ...
==F: The west side?
==G: Yeah, leave yourself enough room to get around the baboons.
==F: Got her.
==G: Go up ... Go ...
==F: I'm at the top of the mountain, Dave.
==G: Okay, go directly {fp|uh} ... Do you see where the pyramid is?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Go as far north as the base of the pyramid ...
==F: {ab|S} ... {fg|Eh} keep going up the side of the mountain?
==G: Yeah, but go straight north once you hit the peak, and ...
==F: Straight north!  I'll run into {ab|s} a lemon grove.
==G: Okay, go around the lemon grove ... {ab|g} to the west side.
==F: Yeah, I'm around the lemon grove now.
==G: Okay, go around the pyramid, up on top, and to the east.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay, do you have a ... You don't have a cobbled street, do you?
==F: No, I got a poisoned stream though.
==G: Okay, what you're doing is, go right underneath the pyramid, to the edge of the pyramid ...
==F: To the west edge, right?
==G: That's right.  Do you have the remote village?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} follow a soft line, {ph|dlike=like} go one finger west of the pyramid, and ...
==F: Yeah, I'm there now.
==G: Okay, and go directly south, underneath the remote village ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Leave yourself half an inch ...
==F: Okay, I'm there now.
==G: Okay, one finger ... east of the {le|e} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: right at the same height as the letter {le|n} in {ci|mountain} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: draw yourself an {le|x}, that's the finish.
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, you have your start point and you have ... a, like, a forest fire ... underneath it?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, go out a {ab|cen} ... like ... a centimetre to the left so you're like a half a centimetre down the left-hand side of the forest fire. Go down about ten centimetres ...
==F: Parallel with farmyard?
==G: Yeah, you want to be {ab|r} straight across from the bottom of farmyard.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay.  And then you want to go ... bend to the right about four centimetres ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And now you're going to go up the left-hand side of the adventure playground.
==F: The left-hand side?
==G: Yeah.  So you got to kind of curve back ...
==F: All right.
==G: And then ... Okay.  From the top of the adventure playground ... You have something underneath your granite quarry, don't you?
==F: Yeah, privately owned fields.
==G: Okay, we're going to go below that.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so you're going to angle up to the corner and then head straight up the page and circle above the granite quarry.
==F: {fp|Uh}, going around the right or around the left?
==G: Around the right.
==F: All right.  I'm there.
==G: So you're going to go out to the right about, what's that, ten centimetres or so?  To the ... To the right-hand edge of that ... {ph|hoo} whatever it is that's there.
==F: Okay, I came around the adventure playground on the left?
==G: Yeah.  Over ...
==F: under privately owned fields?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Hooked north?
==G: Yeah.
==F: went up over top of the granite quarry?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And I'm now sitting at the {le|g}.
==G: Okay, good.  Good.  Exactly.  Okay {fp|um} ... You don't have a ... Do you have a fence or anything underneath the waterfall?
==F: No.
==G: Okay, there's a fence about three centimetres below the word {ci|waterfall}. That runs straight across.
==F: All right.  How big is it?
==G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three centimetres straight across.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?
==G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.
==F: Okay.
==G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an angle ... and then go straight across ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm right between them now.
==G: Okay.  {br|U under=under} the waterfall, like, under the word {ci|waterfall} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and curve up the left-hand side, follow it all the way up, and then ... See that very sharp peak?
==F: Yeah.
==G: On the {br|l eft=left} hand side?  You just want to come above that to the right about a centimetre.  Go straight up {ab|unti} {ip|til=until} you're about a centimetre above it and then turn to the right.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, stop there.  Then go another two centimetres ...
==F: On that ...
==G: So {ab|y} ... you're ... you should be straight above the right-hand edge of the waterfall.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now you want to go north two more centimetres, straight north two centimetres.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: And now, do you have any obstacles around here?
==F: Yeah.  Public {fp|uh} {ph|tootpath=footpath} or something.  It's, like, about an inch to my right.
==G: Yeah, that's good.  Okay, we're going to go ... above that and then down to the right, and circle under the fallen cairn, on the right-hand edge of the paper?
==F: All right, I'm under it.
==G: Okay, you just make a big loop and come underneath the fallen cairn.
==F: I'm under it.
==G: Okay, do you have limestone cliffs or, like, limestone or ...?
==F: No.  I have an east lake.
==G: It's {ab|bet} ... It's between fallen cairn and east lake on the right-hand edge of the paper.
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Um} ... this is the tricky part, right here.  Underneath fallen cairn, when you circle back up ... {ab|y} ... you have to come back to the left ... but {fp|uh} ... Okay, I'm going to give you a point.  See the {le|e} in fallen cairn?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Five centimetres straight above that ... You you come around fallen cairn and then you loop back up to that point.
==F: All right, I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Now go {ab|s} ...
==F: I'm right at the very right-hand side of lion country.
==G: Okay, I don't have that on mine.
==F: Okay, does ...
==G: {ab|Li} ...
==F: From that point, does your line hook low or does it go high?
==G: It goes straight up.
==F: All right, heading for east lake?
==G: Yeah.  Until you're about a half a centimetre away again.
==F: All right, I'm there.
==G: And then follow it ... Okay, see the very bottom left-hand corner?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, we're going to follow it around but instead of ... when we get to that point, just keep going straight towards the cornfields for about another centimetre.
==F: Okay.
==G: Mark the {le|x}.  That's the finish.
==F: That's it.  Done.
==G: Yeah.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you're right above a falls?
==F: Yes, I am.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go ... two centimetres ... west ...
==F: Okay.
==G: And then three centimetres down.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Now.  Directly west of your falls you probably have two objects? ... Do you?
==F: I have banana tree to the very left and that's all I have.
==G: Very {ph|ferry=very} left.  All right, I want you to go ... {fp|um} {ab|s} ... even with the crescent falls to the west, it's about fifteen centimetres {ab|w} left, so you would pass your obstacle ... and then you would arc up to the north.
==F: Around my banana tree?
==G: Do you have a ... Say again.
==F: Around the banana tree?
==G: Around the banana tree.  Do you have some {ph|bidi} {fp|uh} baboons above your {ph|bananha=banana} tree?
==F: I do not.
==G: Okay.
==F: I have nothing above my banana tree.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, just up about ... six centimetres.
==F: {fp|Ah}, okay, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Do you have a footbridge?
==F: Yes, I do.
==G: I want you to go from where I left you ... arc across the footbridge and as soon as you cross ...
==F: Across?  On it?  Over?
==G: Yeah, like on it.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Soon as you get to the other side stop.  Do you have an {fp|uh} a a poison stream ... directly east of the footbridge?
==F: No, I don't but I have an old temple to the right.
==G: Okay.  What we're going to do is you're going to go straight south two ... and a half centimetres ...
==F: From my footbridge?
==G: From your footbridge.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  South two centimetres.
==G: Then you're going to go ... east ... about ... five centimetres ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, and then you have your temple ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: What you're going to do is you're going to go up ... the western side of the temple ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Up to the peak.  Now do you have a mountain just slightly to the ...
==F: {ab|S} ... Yes, I do.
==G: Go up, over top of the mountain on the western {ab|si} ... {br|a all=all} the way around and then when you get to the western side stop.  So you're going up on the east side ...
==F: To the peak?
==G: Up to the peak.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have an {ph|anbandoned=abandoned} truck?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Go down ... along the mountain and stop under the {le|k} of the {fp|uh} ... {ci|truck}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Proceed to the {le|a} ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: in {ci|abandoned}.
==F: Okay.
==G: All right.  From the {le|a} you're going to go south ... three centimetres ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you're going to go west three centimetres.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then you're going to go north three centimetres.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you have a white mountain, above your abandoned truck?
==F: Yes, I do.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to draw a line all the way up, until you're even with the peak and stay about ... half a centimetre away from the mountain. You're on the west side of the mountain.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|Y} ... Are you there?
==F: I'm at the peak.
==G: All right.  I want you to {ph|gooo=go} ... seven centimetres straight up ...
==F: From the top?
==G: From the peak.
==F: From the peak?
==G: So, it would be north seven centimetres ...
==F: Yes, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, you have a pyramid to your east?
==F: Yes, I do.
==G: Go straight to the pyramid ...
==F: Okay.  From where I am?
==G: {ph|S} ... From where you are.
==F: {ph|As=Is} that going to be the top of the pyramid?
==G: No, it would be right at the base.
==F: At the base.  I have a lemon grove right in the middle.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You've got to make sure you don't run over the lemon grove.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You got a lemon grove too?
==G: No, I don't.
==F: You don't.
==G: You've got to hit just slightly above the base ... {fp|Uh}, reference the {fp|uh} bottom ... left corner ... You're just about one centimetre above that.
==F: indecipherableSpeech Okay.  There I am.
==G: Are you there?
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to go ... to the {br|north east=northeast} up to the peak ...
==F: {fp|Uh} ...
==G: keeping about a half centimetre away from the pyramid, and then go down the other side keeping a half centimetre from the pyramid ...
==F: Tracing it?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay.
==G: And then go all the way to the {le|p} in the {ci|pyramid}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: All right, go about ... a centimetre and a half to the west of the {le|p}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: All right, do you have a remote village about ten centimetres to twelve centimetres down?
==F: That's correct.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, what I want you to do ... is draw a line ... south, but make it with a gentle bow in it ...
==F: Okay.
==G: so that you'll end up at the {le|r}.  In the {ci|remote}.
==F: On ... right underneath the {le|r}.
==G: Right underneath the {le|r}.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Go to the {le|e} in {ci|village}.
==F: Okay.
==G: About a centimetre and a half past the {le|e} draw an {le|x}.  Straight.
==F: I'm there.  Finished.
==G: Okay.  Done. Anything else?
==G: {ph|Hokay=Okay}.  We're at the start.  Okay, you ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: You want to go down, and to the right ... around whatever it is that's there, I forget.  You have a little ... ravine or something.
==F: Okay.  I have a burnt ...
==G: {fg|Oh} this is the one I did {ab|wi} ... Okay.  Sorry.
==F: Okay.  I have burnt forest ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: carpenter's cottage, and ravine.
==G: Okay.  You want to go ... to the {br|l eft=left} of the burnt forest and the right of the ravine. ... You're going to go down and make a ...
==F: Wait a minute.
==G: Yeah.
==F: To the right of the ravine?
==G: I think.  I don't have the ravine on mine.  I'm just going by memory.
==F: How far over does it hook under burnt forest?
==G: Just to the ... edge of the {le|b}.
==F: Okay.  I think I got it.  Go.
==G: And then you go back to the left so you're ... straight down from where you started, from the start.  You just ... You just ... go out to the right ... about half centimetre below the {le|b}, just swerve out to the right and then swing back.
==F: Okay.  Do you have a carpenter's cottage?
==G: No I don't.
==F: Okay.  I think that's what you're going around.  Anyways ...
==G: Yeah.  That will be it. And then, go down about another ... inch from there {ip|til=until} you're ... parallel to the top ... of the word {ci|ravine} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: It's off to the right.  You have that ravine, right?
==F: {fp|Er}, I think.
==G: It's like ... straight left of the pines.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Now we're going to go straight ... right about ... well ... an inch and a half, about three centimetres.
==F: Underneath the ravine?
==G: Well, we're going to stay to the left of the ravine right now.  Just go straight right about three centimetres.
==F: All right.
==G: {ab|A} and then we're going to go up and above the ravine ... but when we get to the top of the ravine ... we're going to go straight across ... for about ... four centimetres, before we start to curve back down.
==F: And that's heading towards pine grove?
==G: Yeah.
==F: All right.
==G: And then we're going to head down ... and just ... miss the {le|p} in {ci|pine grove}.  And stop there.
==F: Okay.
==G: Here ... There's a tricky ... This is tricky here.  {fp|Erm} ... Okay, what do you have beneath the pine trees?
==F: {fp|Er} ... I have an avalanche site.  It's a little more to the right.  And a concealed hideout.
==G: Okay.  We're going to ... I ... Your avalanche area, how far is it away from the edge of the paper?
==F: {fp|Er}, maybe a centimetre.
==G: Okay.
==F: Like, it's real close to the side.
==G: Okay, {ip|cause=because} what we do is we go out towards it ... and then we come back ... and then we go ... out again around the concealed hideout.
==F: {fg|Oh}, okay.
==G: It's it's kind of {fp|er} ... I don't know what you'd call it.
==F: Do you have avalanche on yours?
==G: No I don't.  That's why I don't know what it looks like.
==F: How close does your route go to the side of the page?
==G: About five centimetres.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ab|Ok} okay.  From the {le|p} ... you go out as far as the {le|v}. And you're about ... two centimetres straight down from the {le|v}. That's as far as you go out.
==F: Okay.  And I hook around the ...
==G: {br|A and=And} then you ... And then ... you start to ... No, you don't go down to the concealed hideout yet.  You turn back to the left ... {fp|erm} ... {ab|unti} ...
==F: And I'm at the bottom of the avalanche now.
==G: until you're underneath the {le|g} ... about a centimetre down.
==F: A centimetre down from grove?
==G: Yeah ... {ab|y} ... {fg|Oh} no no no!  {ph|Un} ... like, from where we ... where we {ab|s} ... were ...
==F: Yeah, okay.
==G: underneath the {le|v}?
==F: Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  We go down a centimetre and and back into the left until we're underneath the {le|g}.
==F: Okay.  Yeah.  I'm there.
==G: And then we swing out, to the right, around the concealed hideout ... and straight underneath it ...
==F: Pardon me.  I hope that didn't get on the tape.
==G: And {ab|sto} ... And {ab|sto} ... Stop {ab|whe} ... Stop when you get to the {le|c}.
==F: So, go around it and make a backward {le|c} and stop under the {le|c}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Do you have a {ab|b} ... You don't have the boathouse just left there, do you?
==F: Just left of it?
==G: Left of the concealed hideout.
==F: No.
==G: You just have the one below it.  Okay.
==F: I have tilled land.
==G: I do, way up, too, but that's not going to come into play here.  You just want to go a centimetre ... straight left of there.
==F: Above one of the crowns there, in crane bay?
==G: Yeah.  Just a little left of that big, first crown.
==F: All right.
==G: And then we're going to go straight down towards crane bay, and hug the shoreline ... about a half a centimetre away and ...
==F: Down to where?
==G: {ab|F} ... Okay, We're going to follow it around in this sort of {fp|er} ... I don't know, that little dip there, to the next point ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: above the {le|c} ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  And then ... you're you're gently going to ... move out ... a little farther, until you're straight across from the {le|c} on land. You'll be about a full centimetre away from the shore.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: Okay.  Go to the ... left of the {le|c}, across straight from the bottom of it ... about a centimetre in from the {ab|sh} from the {fp|er} water.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Now you have a pebbled shore, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  I have a coconut palm tree ... above that, and we have to go between them.
==F: Okay.  I'll cut it real close, then, the pebbled shore?
==G: Yeah.  About ... {fg|Oh}, about a half a centimetre'll do it.
==F: Okay.
==G: It's just north of it.
==F: I'm between them.
==G: Okay.  And then go ... go all the way round the pebbled shore, until you get to the {le|p}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Okay.  Do you have anything below that?
==F: {fp|Er} washed stones.
==G: Okay.  You're going to go round to the left of that ... and circle around, and then come back in towards the flagship.
==F: Okay.  So I go ...
==G: You're making a big loop off to the left and then coming back.
==F: So I go out, around the pebbled shore, around washed stones?
==G: Yeah. ... And then back in so {ab|y} ... And then aim straight for the flagship.
==F: I'm heading there.
==G: Like ... come down and then head straight in at the very last, and stop about a centimetre out from the shore.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
==G: That's it.
==F: Cut!
==G: All right.  {fp|Er}, you're right above a camera shop?
==F: Yes I am.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, underneath the camera shop do you have a parked van? Or a truck?
==F: {fp|Er}, no I don't but I have allotments ... on my right.
==G: Okay.  It's ... doesn't count.  {ip|Kay=Okay}.  From the ... {le|x} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: go to the west about one centimetre ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ph|goooooo=go} down ... until you're even with the {le|c} in {ci|camera shop} ...
==F: Am I making a loop?
==G: {fp|Er}, no.  You're just going straight down, almost.
==F: Okay.
==G: It's a gentle loop.
==F: Okay.
==G: To the {le|c}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You want to go {ph|dowwwn=down} six centimetres straight south ...
==F: From my {le|c}?
==G: From your {le|c}.
==F: Okay, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, then you want to {ph|gooo=go} east, {ph|abouuut=about} four centimetres, do a gentle loop at the bottom ... to the south ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|{ph|Kaay=Kay}=Okay}.  Do you see {ph|theee=the} allotments?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: The little tiny house, {ph|oooon=on} the west?
==F: Okay.
==G: You want to go up, and stop ... right there.
==F: Okay, I'm right there.
==G: All right.  From the allotments do you have something that's about ... {fp|er} twelve to fifteen centimetres east and a little bit north of it?
==F: A flight {ph|yu} ... a flight museum?
==G: Looks good.  Is it directly ...
==F: Says {ci|entrance} on it.
==G: Is it underneath the {fp|er} abandoned monastery?
==F: Yes it is.  It's about ten {ab|cent} ... six centimetres away {ab|fro} {fp|erm} ... underneath the flight {ab|mus} ... flight {ab|museu} ... {gg|Aagh}!  Six centimetres under {ph|theeee=the} monastery.
==G: Okay, what I want you to do ... is draw a gentle ... easterly {ph|northerthe} ... northern ... line, so that it goes underneath that object ...
==F: Underneath the flight {ph|yu} museum?  Like, under the ...
==G: Yes.
==F: under the words?  Yeah.
==G: And then it {fp|er} ... Soon as you pass it you turn up ...
==F: Okay.
==G: and you go straight up towards the monastery, and you pass on the east side of the {le|y} ... and you arc around monastery and stop at the {le|a}.
==F: Over the top, right?
==G: Over the top.
==F: {ph|Ooookay=Okay}, I'm there.
==G: All right.  Do you have anything to the west of your {fp|er} ... abandoned monastery?
==F: {fp|Erm}, I have a a west lake ... obviously to the west, and alpine garden above that.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  How big is west lake?
==F: West lake is about five centimetres tall and about seven {ab|seve} seven centimetres wide.
==G: Is it right underneath the alpine garden?
==F: It's about four, five, six centimetres underneath.
==G: Okay.  So I think we're going over top of ... the lake.
==F: Okay. Underneath the garden?
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Underneath ... Okay, from the {le|a} we want to go ... four centimetres west ...
==F: {ph|Oookay=Okay}.
==G: And then we want to arc up a little bit ...
==F: {gg|Mmhmm}.
==G: towards the north, and then we go straight up the {ab|n} {fp|er} ... the west side of alpine garden ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ph|aaaaand=and} you stop as soon as you're right above the garden ...
==F: I'm there.
==G: then you {ph|gooooo=go} ... two centimetres east ... Do you have a youth hostel?
==F: {fp|Erm} ...
==G: Right, {fp|er} ...
==F: No I don't.  I have nothing above ... within about ten centimetres diameter.
==G: Okay.  From where I left you you're right at the ... eastern ... corner of the {fp|er} ... garden? ... {fp|Er}, northeast corner? Of the garden?
==F: Yes I am.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to go straight north, {ph|forrr=for} ... four and a half centimetres ...
==F: Okay.
==G: three {ph|centimetrrres=centimetres} east ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Stop right there for a second.
==F: I'm there.
==G: Look {fp|erm} ... southeast.  Do you have a telephone booth?
==F: Yes I do.  Telephone box. But that's at the bit ... That's the centre ...
==G: Okay.  Booth, box, same thing.  See ...
==F: centre-right of my page.
==G: {ph|Yeright=Yes, all right}.  Do you see the {le|t}?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: From where I left you draw a straight line to the {le|t}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, go ... right along the writing ... to the east ...
==F: Underneath?  Under?
==G: Under.
==F: Okay.
==G: Then I want you to go ... up ... {fp|er} ... three centimetres once you pass the {le|x} ...
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Right above the telephone do you have a thatched, mud hut?  Or a ...
==F: Level crossing.  Looks like a fence.
==G: Doesn't count.
==F: No.  Okay I {ab|d} ... I have nothing there then.
==G: All right.  I want you to reference where I last left you.  You're about one centimetre to the east of the top of the {fp|er} ... telephone box?
==F: One {ph|centrereet} ... centimetre on top?
==G: You're about one centimetre {fp|er} ...
==F: Higher.
==G: Higher.
==F: Okay.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I want you to angle ... northwest for about two centimetres ...
==F: Forty-five degree angle?  Approximately?
==G: {ip|Bout=About} a forty-five degree angle.
==F: Okay.  I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Look up, and do you have a east lake?
==F: Yes I do.
==G: Can you see the {le|a} in {ci|lake}?
==F: {fp|Erm}, first {le|e}?  Or ...
==G: The {le|a}.
==F: First {le|a}?
==G: {le|A} in {ci|lake}.
==F: Okay.
==G: You want to go straight north towards the {le|a}.  Stop about a half a centimetre before you hit the water.
==F: I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Now you're going to turn west ... go straight along the shore of the lake ... keeping that half centimetre and as soon {rp|oon} as you pass the land ... See how it juts into the land?
==F: {fp|Erm} ...
==G: The water juts into the land?
==F: Are you talking east or west here?
==G: It would be on the {ab|wi} west side.  It's a little tiny jut.
==F: Bottom, right?
==G: On the bottom.
==F: Bottom left?
==G: Bottom left.
==F: I'm ... Bottom left, I'm there.
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, go one and a half centimetres more west ...
==F: Okay.
==G: Draw an {le|x}.
==F: I'm there.
==G: We're done.
==F: Finished!
==G: {ip|Kay=Okay}, Marcus {ph|Kental} Kendal, burnt forest?
==F: Yeah.
==G: At start?
==F: Yeah.
==G: {fp|Uh} ... Go {ab|un} ...
==F: Going under ...
==G: Okay ...
==F: Over it?
==G: No.  {ph|nn-nn} ... This'll be a bit tricky.  {ab|G} {fp|uh} at the {br|w west=west} tip in the middle ...
==F: West tip in the middle?  Yeah.
==G: {ab|Oka} {ab|we} you have a mark, {le|x}, right?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, go from that {le|x} to ... half a centimetre beside the {le|b} in {ci|burnt}.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay.  Go ...
==F: The middle log?
==G: Yeah, {ab|y} go to the {le|b} in {ci|burnt}.  You've got to go on an angle {ip|cause=because} you're avoiding something.
==F: Yeah, I see what I'm avoiding.
==G: {fg|Oh} okay, good.  All right.
==F: Is it the ravine, the cottage or what?
==G: What's below the burnt forest that you have?
==F: I've got ... I've got a carpenter's cottage and ravine.
==G: Okay, go ... down to the east side of {ph|thuuh=the} cabin ...
==F: The {ab|e} ...
==G: go under and then come back up on the east side.  And up over the ravine.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so you want me to go down the east side, go around to the west and up in between that and the ravine.
==G: Yeah, stay close to the ravine because there's a remote village above it.
==F: All right.
==G: Okay?
==F: Yeah, I'm going {ab|aro} ... I'm going underneath ... the carpenter's house?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And I'm staying to the ... the east side ...
==G: Yeah.
==F: of the ravine?
==G: That's right.  Perfect.
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm just slightly above the ravine now.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} do you have the pine grove?
==F: {fp|Uh} {ab|t} ... Yeah, it's right at the east.
==G: Okay, take your line and go ...
==F: Around it?
==G: No, you're going under it, just ... go under it closer to the pine grove ...
==F: Okay, so do I go straight across?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay, now I'm ... Now I {ab|th} ... Then I curve down and go around the pines?
==G: Yeah, you're going ... You'll stay to the west side.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Stop at {le|p}.
==F: Yeah, {ab|g} I'm stopped at the {le|p}, yeah.  I'm there, Dave.
==G: What do you have under pine grove that ...
==F: I've got ... I've got a, like, a little hill, whatever.
==G: Okay, go around it to the right.  Standard width.
==F: To the right?
==G: Yeah.
==F: So you want me to go all the way under the pine grove and then down around?
==G: Stay to the west of the pine grove ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and go in between that pine grove and whatever that little thing is.
==F: Am I going north or south, Dave?
==G: South.
==F: Okay.
==G: Okay, do you have the concealed hideout?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay ... That's just south of the other bump?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {ab|g} ...
==F: It's in between those two?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Good enough.  I'm in between them now.
==G: Okay, don't go in between them.  Make a little indent to where ... you know, they get closer, and go around that one to the east as well. And underneath.
==F: Underneath the concealed hideout?
==G: Yeah.  Come back west, straight ...
==F: Okay, I'm at the same concealed hideout.
==G: Okay, {ab|y} come back south and to the west around ...
==F: South and to {ab|th} ... around the bay?
==G: Yeah ...
==F: {ab|Stick} ... {ab|St} ...
==G: Yeah, you're ... you're coming underneath it.
==F: Underneath the bay?
==G: Underneath the concealed hideout.
==F: No I'm not. ... I'm right {ab|be} ... I'm at the west ... I'm at the west ... I'm right at {le|c} in {ci|concealed}.
==G: Okay.  No, scratch that.  Go up ... to where, you know, you first made the jog west.  You need to go around to the east.
==F: I need to go all the way around it?
==G: Yeah.
==F: And come out at where it ... At the {le|c}?
==G: That's right but go with ... go the ... go around it east, coming west.
==F: How can you go around something east, going west, Dave?
==G: Just go around to the right-hand side.
==F: Done.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} do you have the boathouse?
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, {fp|uh} hang a {ab|s} ... go directly south at the boathouse ...
==F: From the ... From the {le|c} in {ci|concealed}?
==G: Yeah.
==F: So I got to go back around?
==G: Okay, we're really screwing this up.
==F: Just keep going!  I got to go around the boathouse ...
==G: Okay right, you're east of the boathouse, right?
==F: No, I'm west of the boathouse.
==G: You're west of the boathouse!
==F: The {ab|conceal} ... the concealed {fp|uh} hideout is four fingers north ... of the boathouse.
==G: Okay, we're looking at two different boathouses.  There's another boathouse directly underneath that.
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ...
==F: Hurry!
==G: The {ab|d} ... Do you see the ... the point ...
==F: Yeah, I got the point in the bay right here.  I got it.
==G: That's east.  Go two fingers up on that ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: Okay?  Make your turn there coming straight south and follow crane bay ...
==F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  So you just ... There's a little boathouse in there that you don't want me to hit?
==G: That's right.
==F: Okay, now I'm following the bay.
==G: {ab|Oka} ...
==F: Where are we going now, Dave?
==G: Do you have the coconut palm?
==F: {ph|Nno=No}, I got {fp|uh} stones ... {fp|uh} {ab|sh} washed stones and pebbled shore.
==G: Okay, what you want to do is ... {fp|uh} ... go to ... follow crane bay and go up over top pebbled shore, stay close to pebbled shore.
==F: So keep following it {ip|til=until} I get to pebbled shore?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Okay, I'm I'm staying really close to pebbled shore.
==G: Okay, go up and around it ... up to your left ...
==F: To my left?
==G: Yeah.
==F: Why, what's there?
==G: Well, {ip|cause=because} you want to go around it, up top, that way.
==F: Okay, there's {ab|someth} ... What's in the middle of your map, Dave?
==G: Okay, {br|wh what=what} you're avoiding is a coconut palm that you don't have.
==F: Yeah, but I can go in between it, right?
==G: Yeah, that's what you want to do.  So it's ...
==F: All right.  So I'm I'm in between it, so now where am I?  I'm at the {le|p} in the {ci|{ab|p}} {fp|uh} {ci|pebbled}.
==G: Okay.  You have something underneath pebbled shore?
==F: Yeah, I got to go in between it?
