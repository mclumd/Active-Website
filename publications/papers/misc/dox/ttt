G: Giver
F: Follower
      
-2 G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then
      you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...
-1 F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?
-0 G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of
      the ravine ...


-- G: And then you connected to the two last points, and now I'm telling
      you to go due north, and you're going to go right through a river?
-- F: Yeah.  {ip|Cause=Because} the rope bridge is ... {fp|er} above and to
      the right of the banana tree.
-- G: Yeah?  So the river should {ph|beee=be} to the right of the banana
      trees.
-- F: Yeah.  But you told me to go to the left of banana tree.
-- G: Yeah.  The left of the banana trees.
-- F: Okay.  I get you.  Okay.
-- G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.
-- F: Yeah.
-2 G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
-1 F: I'll go right to the rope rope bridge.
-0 G: No, you want to go due north ...
+1 F: Yeah.
+2 G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point
      and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a
      little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of
      the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?


-2 G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...
-1 F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
-0 G: Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.


-2 G: Have you got any ...
-1 F: {fp|Er} I have lost steps but they're ... very far north of the
      waterfall.
-0 G: Okay.  No, no, no.  What you {fp|er} ... You have to go ... four
      fingers up, and then start turning to the left.  Have you got {br|f
      fallen=fallen} pillars?
+1 F: Yes.
+2 G: Okay.  You'll be going ... north, just above the pillars, and then
     you'll be turning ... west ...


-2 G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and
      you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.
-1 F: Below the writing?
-0 G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre
      below the writing.
+1 F: All right.
+2 G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.


-4 G: Okay.  Along the edge of the waterfalls, have you got ... lost steps?
      Above?
-3 F: No.
-2 G: {gg|Hmm}.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you want me to go over the waterfalls?
-0 G: No.  Alongside of it.
+1 F: Up?
+2 G: {fg|Eh} up north.


-2 G: Okay ... {gg|Oh}!  All right. ... Okay, so now you're going to go
      ... to the left-hand side ... of the forest fire site ... and go
      ... straight down south.
-1 F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?
-0 G: No.  No.  Go west.
+1 F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.
+2 G: Yeah.


-2 G: Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit {br|north
      east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ... until you come to
      in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your stopping point would be
      {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south}
      west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You see that, way up there?
      But you're still {ab|s} ...
-1 F: So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?
-0 G: No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line
      with the southeast corner ...
+1 F: So I go ...
+2 G: southwest corner, sorry, of east lake.


-2 G: You're going south.
-1 F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled
      street, I'm going before it?
-0 G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost
      ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.
+1 F: Okay.  All right, got you.
+2 G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?


-2 G: To the east of it?
-1 F: A tyre swing?
-0 G: {fp|Uh}, no, to the east of it, further.  My map's empty here.
+1 F: A privately owned fields?
+2 G: Privately owned fields.


-2 G: {fp|Uh} over the {ab|r} ... over the granite quarry ... down towards
      the train crossing and up along the west side ... of the {fp|uh}
      waterfall.
-1 F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I'm going around the train crossing?  Underneath
      it?
-0 G: No, you're going over top of the train quarry or the {ab|r} {fp|uh}
      train crossing.
+1 F: Going on top of the train crossing ...
+2 G: and along the west side of the {fp|uh} waterfall.


-6 G: {gg|Mmmm}.  We probably don't worry about that {ip|cause=because} you
      ... you're just following a straight line from the allotments over to
      the point where you head north ...
-5 F: Okay.
-4 G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.
-3 F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...
-2 G: Sure.
-1 F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
-0 G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.
+1 F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.
+2 G: Yeah.


-- G: Okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to make a little
      curve out, so that you're back in line with the ... the start ... So
      you're going to {ab|g} ... like, curve in at the {le|b}. Just make a
      little curve in ...
-- F: Yeah.
-- G: then curve back out ... and then, at the bottom of the ravine, not the
      word {ci|ravine}, the ravine itself ...
-- F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
-- G: you're going to head west.
-- F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve
      ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?
-2 G: Right.
-1 F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?
-0 G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: go west.


-- G: Okay, curve over top of the {fp|uh} ... I guess you said it was a
      ... side walk?  Public park?
-- F: Okay.
-- G: And down towards the {fp|uh} fallen ...
-- F: Fallen cairn.  {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
-2 G: Okay.
-1 F: Do I go from ... the {br|north east=northeast} corner of the
      waterfall straight down, to the rocks?
-0 G: No, you have to curve over your {fp|uh} {fp|eh} curve ...
+1 F: {ab|T} ...
+2 G: up ...


-2 G: {fp|Er} ... {br|Y you're=You're} headed {fp|er} {br|s
      straight=straight} straight north and then go over top of the granite
      site.  To the left.
-1 F: So I go around the left-hand side of it?
-0 G: No.  You go ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You go over ... the right-hand side
      of it.
+1 F: Okay.
+2 G: The east side.  Come over the top, and then down ... the west.
