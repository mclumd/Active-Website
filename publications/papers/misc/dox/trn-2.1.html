==G: Tilled land?  {fp|Erm} ... {ph|pu-tu-tuu} ... Go ... around it, down to the bottom of it.
==F: Okay.  So, you just want me to go down the {br|l left=left} hand side of the ravine ...
==G: Yeah.  And then around in front ... of your {fp|er} cottage or whatever it is.  And then go between it and the ravine ...
==F: Yeah.
==G: and then ...
==F: {ab|Ar} ...
==G: turn east and go under ... remote village ...
==F: Hold on.  I don't have ...
==G: {gg|Oh}, you don't have a remote village, do you?
==F: No.
==G: Okay.  {fp|Erm} ...
==F: You want me to go round my tilled land, you said.  Right?
==G: Tilled {ab|lan} ... How far down's your tilled land?
==F: {fp|Erm}, it starts at three fingers down from the carpenter's cottage ...
==G: Okay.  No.  I don't want you to go round ... there.
==F: {ab|Ok} ... Okay.  Just go underneath the ravine, then?
==G: No, no.  I said, go under your cottage ... and go between your cottage and the ravine.  Go up ... Go up in between those two ... and then go underneath the remote village.  But you don't have the remote village. {ph|tu-tu-tuu} ... It's {fp|er} ...
==F: {gg|Oh} ...
==G: Draw a line ...
 
 
-4G: Okay, there's a fence about three centimetres below the word
     {ci|waterfall}. That runs straight across.
-3F: All right.  How big is it?
-2G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three
     centimetres straight across.
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?
-0G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're
     going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an
     angle ... and then go straight across ...

 
-4G: there's a small wagon wheel on your north side.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: So you can mark in the wagon wheel.  And then you ... proceed
     ... counter-clockwise ... around the south and east sides of that
     wagon wheel.  So that you're actually heading northerly or {ab|eith}
     even slightly west of north, going up the east side of that wagon
     wheel.
-1F: Do you have a cactus right below the rift valley?
-0G: No, I haven't got to the cactus or the rift valley yet.  {ab|Y} ...
+1F: You said to go right to the {fg|er} ...
+2G: Towards ...
 
 
-4G: So you miss the rocks by about one finger.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: And you then can proceed about four fingers past the rocks, so that
     you're now {ab|w} ... {ab|s} west southwest of the rocks about three
     or four fingers.  On your north side there should be a stone creek.
-1F: No.  Don't have it.
-0G: No stone creek.  Well it's there, and what you do ...
+1F: {gg|Oh} Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!
+2G: {gg|Oh}.
 
 
-4G: And you're heading ... west northwest at the time.  Do you have a
     swamp marked?
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: Well, you're heading toward the swamp, but you don't go anyplace near
     the swamp, you cut a sharp left, heading south west and then south,
     around that white water, so you're actually passing counter-clockwise
     around the white water or the rapids.
-1F: Okay.  So am I going to go east, again?
-0G: No ...
+1F: Past ... No?
+2G: you're then going to go south.
 
 
-4G: Okay ... {gg|Oh}!  All right. ... Okay, so now you're going to go
     ... to the left-hand side ... of the forest fire site ...
-3F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
-2G: and go ... straight down south.
-1F: So basically, from start go east ... and then south of forest fire?
-0G: No.  No.  Go west.
+1F: Go ... {gg|Oh}, correction, west.
+2G: Yeah.
 
      
-4G: Okay?  Then curve over the top ... and go a little bit {br|north
     east=northeast} ... of the adventure playground ...
-3F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
-2G: until you come to in line with the ... so that {ab|y} ... your
     stopping point would be {ph|theee=the} ... in line with the
     ... {br|{ph|sssouth=south} west=southwest} corner of east lake.  You
     see that, way up there?  But you're still {ab|s} ...
-1F: So, the southwest ... So, do I keep ... go {ab|north} ... northeast?
-0G: No.  Don't go {ph|yor=north} north yet.  Just so that you're in line
     with the southeast corner ...
+1F: So I go ...
+2G: southwest corner, sorry, of east lake.
 
 
-4G: Yeah, okay.  And then curve up underneath the waterfall ...
-3F: So, how far south ... Okay, after I curve ...
-2G: {gg|Oh} just so that you're in line, sorry, just so that you're in
     line with the word {ci|granite quarry}.
-1F: Okay.  So just go ... just basically {br|south east=southeast} until I
     hit the granite quarry.  Okay.  And then from there?
-0G: {ph|Wa} No, no.  You you've gone up over top of the granite quarry,
     right?
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: Okay.  Then come down ... southeast, yeah?
 
 
-4G: Right.
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: Okay.  Do you have a limestone cliffs way off to the {ab|we} ... the
     east, sorry?
-1F: No.
-0G: No.  Okay. Let me see then. Okay.  You see the ... the southeast
     corner of east lake?
+1F: Southeast corner?  Yeah.
+2G: Yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, {ip|cause=because} you've stopped probably by
     now ... at the ... Okay.  {fp|Erm} ... You've come up straight towards
     the cornfields?
 
 
-4G: Okay.  About one finger-width away from the footbridge, and with the
     same northerly boundary but going down about one finger, {fp|uh}
     {ab|d} in a southerly direction there's going to be a poisoned stream.
     It's just an obstacle that we're going to have to go around.
-3F: {ab|Oka} ... Do you have a banana tree there?
-2G: {fp|Uh}, a banana tree?
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: No I don't.  Where's the banana tree?
+1F: That's {fp|uh} southwest of the ... footbridge.
+2G: Okay.  I I'll mark in a banana tree.  I probably going around it at
     one point.
 
 
-4G: Have you got the allotments, to the east southeast of the camera shop?
-3F: Yeah.  That would sort of be in the middle of the van and the camera
     shop, wouldn't it?
-2G: {gg|Mmm}?
-1F: That would be sort of in the middle?  But over to the {fp|uh} ...
-0G: {fg|Oh}, that's way off to the right.  No, the ... the ... the van is
     due south of the camera shop.
+1F: Yeah, I know, but if you were to bring that over it would be in the
     middle of them.
+2G: Bring the van over?
 
 
-4G: You will be going up to it, and you'll be passing over the north side
     of the abandoned monastery from east ...
-3F: Okay, so I have ... I have to curve ... I have to go up with the lake
     lake, then, right?
-2G: {fp|Uh}, you'll be going due north as you go up to the right-hand side
     or east side of the abandoned monastery.  But there's something in
     between, where you made that turn, that ... It's about five fingers'
     breadth ...
-1F: Okay.  Do you have ... a west lake?
-0G: {fg|Oh}.  No. You're probably going around west lake though.  I don't
     have west lake.
+1F: Okay, west lake is just to the {fp|uh} northeast of the start point.
+2G: Okay.  Well ...
 
 
-4G: It'll be inside the big loop that you're making.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: But you just go a straight line, east northeast from the north west
     corner of the allotments.  Take it about eight fingers' breadth and
     that's where you then go due north to meet the {ab|r} east side of the
     abandoned monastery.
-1F: Okay.  D'you have a flight museum?
-0G: No.
+1F: No, okay.  So I'm right at the {fp|uh} southeast corner ...
+2G: of the abandoned monastery.
 
 
-4G: to the abandoned monastery, anyway.
-3F: Just to confirm something.  Do ...
-2G: Sure.
-1F: Do you want me to come around the south of the allotments?
-0G: No.  You ... The north side of the allotments.
+1F: Okay.  So I'm {ab|c} ... I ... I went around the west, to the north.
+2G: Yeah.
 
 
-4G: you're going to head west.
-3F: Okay.  So basically I'm going to be on the ... I'm going to curve
     ... and I'm going to go on the west side of the ravine?
-2G: Right.
-1F: And then, on the word {ci|ravine}, go west, right?
-0G: No. In line with the bottom of the ravine itself ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: go west.
 
 
-4G: In line with the start.
-3F: With the start?
-2G: Yeah, with the start point.  You should be in line, like they should
     ... be in the same line, you know?
-1F: I ... No, I don't have that.
-0G: {ab|Wha} ... What do {ab|y} ... No.  Like, the ... Just {ph|ii} with
     the word {ci|start} ...
+1F: Yeah?
+2G: It should be in the ... When you come out of your curve and stop ...
 
 
-4G: you should stop so that you're in {ab|l} ... directly underneath
     ... the {le|a} in {ci|start}.
-3F: {gg|Oh} okay.  So {ab|basic} ...
-2G: Just ... In line with it.
-1F: Okay.  So, from the ravine I'm going west ... until I'm on with start?
-0G: No, no, no.  From the burnt forest ...
+1F: {gg|Uh-huh}.
+2G: you make your little curve ...
 
 
-4G: And then go due east towards the ravine ... right in line with the
     bottom of the ravine ...
-3F: Okay.  So go ... east towards the ravine then?
-2G: Yeah.  You're going ... They're still the same directions.  And then
     you're curving up to the top of the ravine ...
-1F: Okay.  So am I going to go under the word {ci|ravine}?
-0G: No.  You're you're heading east towards the ravine.
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: Right?  Then when you get to the {ab|sou} the ... the west side of the
     ravine ...
 
 
-4G: South, so that you're in line with the word ... so that you're in line
     with the bottom of the ravine.  How about that?
-3F: Okay.  That's ...
-2G: Can you do that? ...
-1F: Okay, that's where you lost me.  I thought I I was supposed to curve
     over the top of this carpenter's ...
-0G: No, no, no.
+1F: Okay.  So I go south until I'm in line with the ravine ...
+2G: Right.  Then go east ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.  Along the edge of the waterfalls, have you got ... lost steps?
     Above?
-3F: No.
-2G: {gg|Hmm}.
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do you want me to go over the waterfalls?
-0G: No.  Alongside of it.
+1F: Up?
+2G: {fg|Eh} up north.
 
 
-4G: but you haven't got lost steps.
-3F: No.
-2G: Have you got any ...
-1F: {fp|Er} I have lost steps but they're ... very far north of the
     waterfall.
-0G: Okay.  No, no, no.  What you {fp|er} ... You have to go ... four
     fingers up, and then start turning to the left.  Have you got {br|f
     fallen=fallen} pillars?
+1F: Yes.
+2G: Okay.  You'll be going ... north, just above the pillars, and then
     you'll be turning ... west ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.  And under your rapids you've got {fp|er} ... {fp|er} ...
-3F: A manned fort.
-2G: A fort?  A fort, yeah.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, to {ab|th} ...
-1F: Now, is the creek underneath ... above the rapids?
-0G: The {ab|r} ... The ... No, the {fp|er} ... The rapids is above the
     fort, right?
+1F: {fg|Ah} yes it is.
+2G: Okay, then to the right of that you'll have outlaws' ... {fp|er}
     hideaway?  Or hideout?
 
 
-4G: And then just mark in {ci|picnic site} right underneath there and we
     got it.  You got adventure playground?
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: Okay, we're heading east from adventure
     {ph|playcrowned=playground}. We go about three-quarters of the way
     across the page.  Do you have anything there?
-1F: {fp|Uh}, I've I've got privately owned fields above adventure
     playground to the right and {ph|belowww=below} it to the right I have
     farmyard.
-0G: Yeah, okay, no problem then.  Okay, privately owned field?
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: Be ... Okay. And then we go ... north, after we're across
     three-quarters of the page and we go up and we got granite quarry.  Do
     you have that?
 
 
-4G: {ph|Awwkaay=Okay}. But it's directly below the eastern, bottom,
     southern corner of {fp|uh} ... east lake?
-3F: {ab|Ok} okay, the the {ab|south} ... southeast corner ...
-2G: Yeah.
-1F: Not where the finish line is?
-0G: No, not where the finish line is.
+1F: That's the southwest corner.
+2G: That's right.  Southeast corner.
 
 
-4G: And start making your way slightly on an angle down to remote
     village. You have that?
-3F: Okay, now am I going ...
-2G: You're going south.
-1F: {br|Y yeah=Yeah} okay, but I'm ... I'm not going around cobbled
     street, I'm going before it?
-0G: No, you're going around it. Cobbled street on my map would be almost
     ... on the left-hand side of the pyramid, in line with it.
+1F: Okay.  All right, got you.
+2G: So you have to avoid the left-hand side of the pyramid?
 
 
-4G: Okay ... Have you got anything in the {fp|uh} adventure playground
     area? Like ...
-3F: Yeah, they're ... tyres?
-2G: To the east of it?
-1F: A tyre swing?
-0G: {fp|Uh}, no, to the east of it, further.  My map's empty here.
+1F: A privately owned fields?
+2G: Privately owned fields.
 
 
-4G: Do you have a waterfall?
-3F: Yes.
-2G: Okay, curve down towards the train crossing ... and up along the west
     side of the waterfall.  Stop when you get to the top of the waterfall.
-1F: Wait, my train crossing is {fp|um} {br|north west=northwest} of the
     waterfall.
-0G: {fg|Oh} no no, not that train crossing.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay ...
 
 
-4G: {fp|Uh} over the {ab|r} ... over the granite quarry ...
-3F: Okay.
-2G: down towards the train crossing and up along the west side ... of the
     {fp|uh} waterfall.
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, so I'm going around the train crossing?  Underneath it?
-0G: No, you're going over top of the train quarry or the {ab|r} {fp|uh}
     train crossing.
+1F: Going on top of the train crossing ...
+2G: and along the west side of the {fp|uh} waterfall.
 
 
-4G: And down towards the {fp|uh} fallen ...
-3F: Fallen cairn.  {ip|Kay=Okay} ...
-2G: Okay.
-1F: Do I go from ... the {br|north east=northeast} corner of the waterfall
     straight down, to the rocks?
-0G: No, you have to curve over your {fp|uh} {fp|eh} curve ...
+1F: {ab|T} ...
+2G: up ...
 
 
-4G: Close to shore but ...
-3F: Until I hit that {fp|um} bump there?
-2G: {ip|Til=Until} you ...
-1F: That corner?
-0G: {ip|Til=Until} you hit the {fp|uh} ... No, just a bit away from the
     border.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: And when you get to the corner ...
 
 
-4G: {fp|Uh} which boathouse?  How many ... Is it right beside {fp|uh}
     concealed hideout?
-3F: No.  It's on crane bay.
-2G: Okay, approximately two fingers from concealed hideout is a boathouse,
     directly to the west of it.
-1F: So it's not on {ab|le} the water?
-0G: No it isn't.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay, you'll go out two fingers, stop, and then head south, towards,
     like, a bite mark in crane bay ...
 
 
-4G: Yeah, go over the top come back down to the {le|a} on the other side.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: Okay, then you're going to ... {ab|l} make a small loop ... up, around
     left-hand side of the alpine gardens.  Stop at the top of alpine
     gardens.
-1F: Dead centre top?
-0G: No.
+1F: Okay. ... Top left side?
+2G: Top left.  Then go straight across the top to the top right-hand side.
 
 
-4G: And the river's to the right of the banana trees.
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.
-1F: I'll go right to the rope rope bridge.
-0G: No, you want to go due north ...
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: until you get between the word {ci|rope} and {ci|bridge}. Put a point
     and connect that point. And then, what I want you to do is curve up a
     little bit and {br|h hit=hit} the rope bridge ... on the left side of
     the {br|r r rope=rope} bridge ... Got me?
 
 
-4G: and from your last two dots, curve it a little bit.  Don't make it a
     straight line.  Curve the line a bit.
-3F: Got you.
-2G: Okay.  Now what I want you ... Do you have any lost steps or
     {ph|staps=steps} or something like that?
-1F: Lost steps.  {ph|Waaay=Way} way up, about {fp|er} ...
-0G: Okay.  No, no.  {ab|I} I got different lost steps.  {ip|Kay=Okay}, so
     what ... All right.  And then you have fallen pillars, right?
+1F: {fp|Er}, right in the centre of the page.
+2G: Yeah.  Okay.  Now, what I'm going to give you is an obstacle right
     beside fallen pillars, and you're going to have to go up ... So what I
     want you to do is go north from your last point ... until you are
     right in line ... with ... the middle of those pillars ...
 
 
-4G: Right towards the edge of the paper.
-3F: Right.  And I'm ...
-2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
-1F: going over outlaws' hideout to get there?
-0G: Over {fp|uh} ... No, you're going under the outlaws' hideout.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}?
 
 
-4G: Yeah.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: And then go west {fp|uh} about three inches ...
-1F: Yes.  What's over there?
-0G: {fp|Uh} stop there and {fp|uh} begin {fp|uh} ... curve, that is
     {fp|uh} dip, for {fp|uh} ... half an inch, no more than that.
+1F: Yeah, I got a palm tree over there.
+2G: {fp|Uh} so go around the palm tree.
 
 
-4G: So just go south {fp|uh} for {fp|uh} half an inch ...
-3F: Okay.
-2G: {fp|Uh} then {fp|uh} ... go ... go east for {fp|uh} one and a half
     inch ...
-1F: Is there anything over there?
-0G: {fp|Uh} no.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: {fp|Uh} then make a slight curve and go ... up north for about {fp|uh}
     two inches to the {ab|r} ... to the ... {fp|uh} and end to the
     ... left of the old temple.
 
 
-4G: And {fp|uh} ... stop around {fp|uh} half an inch from the top of the
     temple ...
-3F: Seen.
-2G: {fp|Uh} then go {fp|uh} ... {br|north west=northwest} for about an
     inch ...
-1F: Do you have the state mountain?
-0G: No {ab|A=I} ... No I don't.
+1F: {ab|D} ...
+2G: But I guess you have to go ... {fp|uh} around that.
 
 
-4G: Yeah.
-3F: Okay, seen.
-2G: {fp|Uh}, once you get to the {ab|k} {le|k}, go under the phrase
     ... right under the phrase {ci|abandoned truck} ...
-1F: Seen.
-0G: {fp|Uh} when you get to {le|a} ... {fp|uh} make a {ab|s} ... very
     slight curve and go down for about ... {fp|Er} do you have baboons? No
     you don't. {fp|Uh} ... when you get to {le|a} go straight down for
     about {fp|uh} ... one inch ... ending with a slight curve and then
     turn {fp|uh} ... west and go {ab|a} another {fp|uh} inch to the west
     ...
+1F: Seen.
+2G: And then {fp|uh} go {fp|uh} ... Do you have white mountain?
 
 
-4G: Stop there and turn {fp|uh} east ... Do you have {fp|er} pyramid?
-3F: Pyramid?
-2G: Yeah.
-1F: Yes.  You got the lemon grove there?
-0G: {fp|Uh} {ph|nnno=no} I don't.
+1F: Okay, do you got the poison stream?
+2G: {fp|Uh} yes there is one.
 
 
-4G: I want you to go around that.  Do you have a picnic site?
-3F: {fp|Uh} ...
-2G: Down below the site of the forest fire?
-1F: {fp|Uh}, adventure playground.
-0G: {fp|Uh}, no I'm looking {ab|d} due south of the site of the forest
     fire.
+1F: {fp|Uh}, nothing directly due south, no.
+2G: Okay, what I want you to do is I want you to curve out like we did
     last time, {fp|uh} to the {br|b bottom} of the {le|s}, you know where
     ... {ci|site of forest fire} ... the {le|s} there ...
 
 
-4G: Below the {ab|f} site of {ab|s} forest ... site of forest fire ... you
     want to go down three and a half to four inches.
-3F: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Got you.
-2G: Now I want you to curve to the right going due east ...
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: for about two and a half {ab|inche} ... no, three inches ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Two and a half inches.
 
 
-4G: loop around the abandoned monastery ...
-3F: Loop ...
-2G: and stop at the {le|a}.
-1F: In {ci|monastery}?
-0G: No.  The first {le|a} ...
+1F: {fg|Oh}!
+2G: {ci|abandoned}.
 
 
-4G: Okay.
-3F: I got pebbled shore.
-2G: Pebbled shore.
-1F: You got washed stones?
-0G: {fp|Uh}, no I don't.  Okay, {fp|uh} you are parallel with the bottom
     of the letter {le|c}?
+1F: Yes.
+2G: {fp|Uh} go now an inch to the west ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.  So what we're going to do is ... Okay, {ab|y} you go down, you
     go underneath the little thing, the banana trees, you keep on going
     west ...
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: until {fp|er} ... {ip|til=until} you reach ... you reach the
     gorillas. Now you want to ... You want to stay on the left-hand side
     of the gorillas.
-1F: The {ab|gori} ... Okay, the gorillas are just an inch and a {ab|ha}
     ... So ... You know the river?  Do you have a straight river?
-0G: No I don't.
+1F: {gg|Oh}, okay.  Reference rope bridge ...
+2G: Yeah.
 
 
-4G: Yeah.
-3F: that's where my rock fall is.
-2G: Okay.
-1F: So, do you ... Do I go ... Do I go ... Which side do I go?  Above the
     rock fall or below the rock fall?
-0G: No, you go above the rock fall.
+1F: Okay, so I'm above the rock fall, I do have a white mountain.
+2G: Okay.  Basically you want to ... The way the the mountain peak goes
     you do the exact same thing, sticking right by it.  You go up on the
     {fp|er} northeast trajectory, when you reach the peak you come down on
     the southeast trajectory.
 
 
-4G: Okay.  {fg|Erm} ... Go ... down ... the left side of rocks ... and
     {fp|er} ... so that you're just below the top of white water, and keep
     going left.
-3F: White water?  I don't have white water.
-2G: But {ab|st} ... Or, rapids. ... Okay?
-1F: So I'm just above ... rapids, and go left?
-0G: No, stay below the top of ... rapids, and then come up over it.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay.  {fg|Erm} ... You go over the top of rapids ...
 
 
-4G: Okay, we're going to be going straight up and around the top of that
     ...
-3F: Around the top of ... granite quarry?
-2G: Yes.
-1F: Will I be coming across underneath the privately owned fields first?
-0G: Privately owned fields?  No, you should be going ... Yeah, underneath
     that.
+1F: Okay, let me put this differently.  Do you have the farmyard?
+2G: Yes.
 
-0G: No, no, on the right-hand side, around the top.  And when you get to
     the second peak, stop.
 
-4G: Do you have that?
-3F: Yes.
-2G: Okay, from where I left you we're going to be heading underneath
     fallen cairn.  Okay?
-1F: All right.  Is there {ab|n} ... Okay.  Do you have public footpath?
-0G: No.
+1F: It is ... up one inch and right one inch up from waterfall.  Is there
     anything between fallen cairn and {ab|publi} {fp|uh} public footpath?
+2G: I have nothing.
 
 
-4G: And stop.
-3F: All right.
-2G: Go straight up the page ... {ip|til=until} you get to ... the base
     ... even with pyramid, if you have it.
-1F: Do you have lemon grove?
-0G: No.
+1F: I have pyramid ...
+2G: Okay.
 
-0G: Okay.  No, {ab|yo} you're to the right of them.
-0G: {ph|Naaaaaa=No} ... If they're right below the granite quarry you
     should be to the {fp|er} ...
 
-4G: Yeah.  Thing is though, {ab|a} as soon as you ... as soon as your pen
     comes in contact with the ... or {fp|er} the same line as the {le|g}
     in {ci|granite} ...
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: you straighten out.
-1F: Straight south?
-0G: No.  No.  No.  Straight {fp|er} west.
+1F: Do I go {ab|at} across the top of the train crossing?
+2G: Yeah.  You're you're on top of the ... the train crossing ...
 
 
-4G: {gg|Uh-huh}.
-3F: the top of it is right below the {le|c}.  About an inch and a half
     down.
-2G: Okay, now, yeah.  You {fp|er} ...
-1F: I go over top of it?
-0G: No ... No.  I don't ... I don't have the ... I don't have the footpath
     on my map at all.  So looks like you want to avoid that.
+1F: Okay.  So I'm at the tip of the waterfall still.
+2G: Okay.  Now, {ph|hya} ... Have you gone ... Have you gone {fp|er} ...
 
 
-4G: {fg|Erm}, I have a cobbled street between pyramid and remote village.
-3F: I have {fp|er} nothing.
-2G: Okay.  So {fg|erm}, go ... left and {ab|s} ... and down, like on a
     ... bit of a slant ... and then down the {ab|l} ... to the left-hand
     corner of remote village ...
-1F: {fg|Er}, do I cross {ph|theeee} ... {fp|er} ... cobbled street?
-0G: No.  No you don't.  You ... keep it {fg|er} ... Okay, cobbled street
     ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: the left-hand edge of it ... is just a little bit ... past the corner
     of the pyramid.  So go out a little bit ...
 
 
-4G: you swing out to the right ... Okay, do you have anything right below
     the pine grove?
-3F: Avalanche.
-2G: You have an avalanche?
-1F: Do you have an avalanche?
-0G: No I don't.  That's what it is.  Okay, you want to swing out {ab|arou}
     ...
+1F: {fg|Oh}, hang on a sec ... avalanche.  Reference {fp|uh} the {le|e} in
     {ci|pine grove}, the last {le|e}?
+2G: Yeah.
 
 
-4G: {ab|Button} ... Yeah.  And then you go straight across so you're going
     straight west.
-3F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, I'm heading west.
-2G: Okay now, {fp|um} ... Do you have a boathouse? ... {ab|Refere} ...
-1F: I have a boathouse in in the bottom right-hand corner.
-0G: Okay, no.  Okay, {fp|uh} ... Right above the word {ci|crane} ...
+1F: Yes.
+2G: Directly in line with concealed hideout, there's a boathouse.
 
 
-4G: Okay.  Do you have anything below that?
-3F: I have {ph|aaa=a} flight museum.
-2G: White museum right below the abandoned monastery?
-1F: Yes, right below {ph|aaaand=and} you have west lake?
-0G: {fp|Er}, no I don't.
+1F: Okay.  From your start point ... right above it is west lake {fp|er}
     ... There's {ph|aaa=a} ... about ... Okay, from ... allotments ... go
     ... two o'clock ... about three fingers ... and that's {fp|er} flight
     museum.
+2G: Flight museum, two fingers ... two o'clock?
 
 
-4G: And you have ... a stone creek to the {fp|er} left?
-3F: I have ... Yes, rapids.
-2G: {fg|Er} ... white water rapids you mean?
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: Okay.  But you have no stone creek?
+1F: {fg|Er}, no.
+2G: Okay.  To the left of rocks you have a stone creek ... and above white
     water you have {fp|er} ... stone creek and {fp|er} ... White water and
     stone creek are {ph|fffairly=fairly} close together ...
 
-0G: {fg|Er}, no more than {fp|er} ... I'd say, an inch separates the
     {fp|er} ... stone creek from the white water ... on the right-hand
     corner, top.
-0G: Then the line will start to curve again and you will go down the side
     of the page.  You'll be no more than ... I I'd say a quarter of an
     inch from the edge of the page ...
-0G: {fg|Er} {ph|nnnnnn} no I don't.
 
-4G: And then {fp|er}, head up and around the granite site.
-3F: Which way around the granite site?
-2G: {fp|Er} ... {br|Y you're=You're} headed {fp|er} {br|s
     straight=straight} straight north and then go over top of the granite
     site.  To the left.
-1F: So I go around the left-hand side of it?
-0G: No.  You go ... {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You go over ... the right-hand side of
     it.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: The east side.  Come over the top, and then down ... the west.
 
 
-4G: {fg|Er} ... What was that?
-3F: Bringing me about even with the top of the banana tree?
-2G: {fg|Er} ... well, {ab|a} ... Where's the banana tree in relation to
     the footbridge?
-1F: {gg|Oh}, you don't have a banana tree?
-0G: No I don't.
+1F: {gg|Oh} okay.  {fg|Erm} ... the banana tree is ...
+2G: Is it below baboons?
 
 
-4G: And stop right there.  Okay.  Now, between footbridge ... and do you
     have an old temple?
-3F: Yes I do.
-2G: Okay.  Now between old temple and footbridge, you have a poisoned
     stream.
-1F: Okay.
-0G: The poisoned stream ... is ... {ab|a} ... no more ... than an inch
     from the footbridge.  Actually I'd say about three-quarter of an
     inches ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: So, they're very close.  So, between the ... the {ph|dyer} the
     poisoned stream and the footbridge ... I want you to take the line and
     go directly {fp|er} {br|i i in=in} the centre, down ... south, about
     ... an inch.
 
 
-4G: Okay, so ... But but between white mountain and abandoned truck you
     have nothing?
-3F: No.
-2G: Okay. So the line ... where the birds are ... on ... Okay actually you
     don't have baboons so {ph|ha} ... you can't see the birds, but
     ... that line will continue on a slight diagonal ... going {br|north
     east=northeast} until you come up {ph|theeeee=the} {fp|er} left
     ... the ... actually the west face of the mountain ...
-1F: Okay.
-0G: You'll be no more than ... I'd say a quarter of an ... of an inch from
     the {ab|f} west face ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: and follow ... the mountain {fp|er} ... {fp|er} the mountain {fp|er}
     ... shape ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.  Parked van ... is directly below camera shop, slightly offset
     east.  Approximately ... three inches.
-3F: Three inches below?
-2G: {ab|T} yeah ... Three inches below.
-1F: Okay.
-0G: And allotments of course {fp|uh} ... is no more than two inches above
     parked van.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay.  I want you to take the line and go ... on the west side of
     camera shop ...
 
 
-4G: Okay, so ... going back to allotments, do you have anything to the
     right of allotments?
-3F: {fp|Uh} no.  The the flight museum is about two and a half inches
     northeast of the allotments.
-2G: Two and a half ... Okay.  I want you to take that line ...
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: go diagonally ... on an angle of about {fp|uh} {ph|fff} no more than
     five {ph|sssix=six} degrees ... and go underneath the flight line
     ... until you come to the {fp|uh} right-hand edge of abandoned
     monastery if you draw an imaginary line down ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay.  If you draw a {ab|ma} an imaginary line at the top of
     allotments {ab|acr} straight across ...
 
-0G: your ... arc ... the line should be no more than ... {fp|uh}
     ... three-quarters of an inch.
 
-4G: Okay?
-3F: Yeah.
-2G: Okay, now you stop at the edge, of abandoned {br|mo
     monastery=monastery}.
-1F: Okay, you want me to bring it up to the monastery?
-0G: {ab|Ye} ... no no no no.  Just just ... that diagonal line ...
+1F: Okay.
+2G: across to the ... you know the the east edge ... but but you know but
     below abandoned monastery just {fp|uh} {ab|y} {fp|uh} {ab|y} ...
 
 
-4G: That's right but {ab|yo} {ab|y} you're going to miss the lake.  You're
     going to go at the bottom of the shore of the lake ... Okay, you'll be
     at the bottom of the lake ... You're going to arc the line ...
-3F: At the ... What do you mean the bottom of the lake?
-2G: Okay.  Where's where's the lake in relation to the abandoned
     monastery? Are they {fp|uh} parallel?  I mean, are they in line with
     each other?
-1F: {fg|Oh}, you don't ... {fg|Oh} sorry, you don't have the lake on?
-0G: No, I don't.
+1F: Okay, if I ... If I take my line, like two inches southwest from
     ... that corner of the monastery I'm at ... {ph|thiii=the} {fp|uh}
     northeastern corner of the lake.
+2G: Okay.  A a {ab|b} a better reference ... Use use the alpine
     garden. Going down from there ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.
-3F: northwesterly angle.
-2G: Okay.  Okay, okay.  Where the word {ci|abandoned monastery} is ...
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: Okay, now you take that line and you're going to arc it down so you're
     no more than about half an inch away from the {le|a} ... where the
     line ... {ab|wher} ...
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: {ab|wher} where the arc line stops.  Okay?
 
 
-4G: Okay?  You're going to go over top of {ph|alpime=alpine} garden. You
     ...
-3F: Okay.
-2G: you're now going east, for about an inch ...
-1F: Over {fg|eh} ... Going west?
-0G: No, you're you're going east. You're going east now.  Stop there.  You
     you ...
+1F: When I went across the top of the alpine garden I thought I went up
     ... I thought I went up the eastern edge.
+2G: Yeah, right across the top of {ab|alpi} alpine garden.  Okay.  You're
     going east.  Okay, do you have a youth hostel?
 
 
-4G: Okay.  About three-quarters of the way into alpine garden top, okay,
     stop there.  Okay, do you have a youth hostel.
-3F: No.
-2G: You don't, {fg|eh}?  Okay, the youth hostel ... is directly
     ... northeast of alpine garden.
-1F: Okay.
-0G: It's no more than an inch ... from the {fp|uh} ... between {fp|uh} the
     word {ci|youth hostel} and the top of alpine garden.  {ab|Y} there's
     no more than an inch separating them.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: Okay.  Now where you ... Where you are there, where you've stopped
     with that line, go directly north ... for about two inches ...
 
 
-4G: An imaginary line.
-3F: Okay, like in half north south?
-2G: Okay, thatched ... If ... Okay, thatched hut ... is approximately
     ... an inch and a half ... in, to east lake, if you draw an imaginary
     line. You know, offset into it?  To {ab|ju} ... But below it.  It's
     about {fp|uh} an inch and a half below east lake ...
-1F: Okay.
-0G: And about an inch and a half ... into east lake.  Okay, {ab|no}
     ... the finish line ... Go to east lake.  Go along the south shore,
     {ip|til=until} you come to a {fp|uh} ... a little bay, just where it
     juts up north ...
+1F: Yeah.
+2G: Okay.  From there, go out about an ... half an inch ... That's your
     finish line right there ...
 
 
-4G: Okay.  You'll be going around that.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: {fp|Er}, boathouse?
-1F: Yeah.
-0G: No?
+1F: Yeah!
+2G: {fp|Er}, there's two, {fg|eh}?
 
-0G: Okay.  No.  I don't want you to go round ... there.
-0G: No, no.  I said, go under your cottage ... and go between your cottage
     and the ravine.  Go up ... Go up in between those two ... and then go
     underneath the remote village.  But you don't have the remote
     village. {ph|tu-tu-tuu} ... It's {fp|er} ...
-0G: No.
-0G: Yeah.  Yeah.  No, {ab|I} ... This one isn't.
 
-4G: Crossing towards the missionary camp. Okay, from there ... You have a
     banana tree in the left-hand corner?
-3F: Yes I do.
-2G: Okay, you're going to move parallel to the bottom of the page ... and
     you want to be about a centimetre below that {ab|ba} banana tree.
-1F: Below the writing?
-0G: {ph|YYYes=Yes}.  No!  Below the tree itself, about half a centimetre
     below the writing.
+1F: All right.
+2G: And you want to stop on the left-hand edge of the tree.
 
-0G: {fp|Er}, no, you go right over top of the cactus and you just stop
     right in the middle ... where it ... the sandy part of the rift valley
     is ...
-0G: No, you're going right over top of it.
 
-4G: {ab|S} ...
-3F: From the noose?
-2G: From where I left you, you have to go ... {fp|er} ... southwest, down
     {br|gent ly=gently} ... until you're underneath the ... {fp|er} noose,
     you're about five centimetres underneath the noose.
-1F: I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not one centimetres away from the noose?
-0G: No.  You're about ...
+1F: Five centimetres.
+2G: five centimetres down.
 
 
-4G: Go straight to the {le|s}.
-3F: Okay.
-2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  Reference the peak of the {fp|er} saloon ... Go four
     centimetres to your left ...
-1F: From ... from where the {le|s} is?
-0G: No.  {ab|Fr} ... Okay.  {ab|G} Look at the top of the {fp|er} ...
+1F: I seen it.
+2G: saloon ...
 
 
-4G: Okay, there's a fence about three centimetres below the word
     {ci|waterfall}. That runs straight across.
-3F: All right.  How big is it?
-2G: Well, it starts about the {le|a} in waterfall ... and it's about three
     centimetres straight across.
-1F: {ip|Kay=Okay}, do I go around the bottom of it?
-0G: Yeah, you're going to go ... you're going to {ab|g} ... No, no, you're
     going to go above it, between there and the word {ci|waterfall}.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: So you're going to come down like three centimetres to the left on an
     angle ... and then go straight across ...
 
 
-4G: Go straight to the pyramid ...
-3F: Okay.  From where I am?
-2G: {ph|S} ... From where you are.
-1F: {ph|As=Is} that going to be the top of the pyramid?
-0G: No, it would be right at the base.
+1F: At the base.  I have a lemon grove right in the middle.
+2G: {ip|Kay=Okay}.  You've got to make sure you don't run over the lemon
     grove.
 
-0G: No, I don't.
 
-4G: Just to the ... edge of the {le|b}.
-3F: Okay.  I think I got it.  Go.
-2G: And then you go back to the left so you're ... straight down from
     where you started, from the start.  You just ... You just ... go out
     to the right ... about half centimetre below the {le|b}, just swerve
     out to the right and then swing back.
-1F: Okay.  Do you have a carpenter's cottage?
-0G: No I don't.
+1F: Okay.  I think that's what you're going around.  Anyways ...
+2G: Yeah.  That will be it. And then, go down about another ... inch from
     there {ip|til=until} you're ... parallel to the top ... of the word
     {ci|ravine} ...
 
 
-4G: Okay, {ip|cause=because} what we do is we go out towards it ... and
     then we come back ... and then we go ... out again around the
     concealed hideout.
-3F: {fg|Oh}, okay.
-2G: It's it's kind of {fp|er} ... I don't know what you'd call it.
-1F: Do you have avalanche on yours?
-0G: No I don't.  That's why I don't know what it looks like.
+1F: How close does your route go to the side of the page?
+2G: About five centimetres.
 
-0G: {br|A and=And} then you ... And then ... you start to ... No, you
     don't go down to the concealed hideout yet.  You turn back to the left
     ... {fp|erm} ... {ab|unti} ...
-0G: Yeah ... {ab|y} ... {fg|Oh} no no no!  {ph|Un} ... like, from where we
     ... where we {ab|s} ... were ...
 
-4G: go to the west about one centimetre ...
-3F: I'm there.
-2G: {ph|goooooo=go} down ... until you're even with the {le|c} in
     {ci|camera shop} ...
-1F: Am I making a loop?
-0G: {fp|Er}, no.  You're just going straight down, almost.
+1F: Okay.
+2G: It's a gentle loop.
 
 
-4G: {fp|Uh} ... Go {ab|un} ...
-3F: Going under ...
-2G: Okay ...
-1F: Over it?
-0G: No.  {ph|nn-nn} ... This'll be a bit tricky.  {ab|G} {fp|uh} at the
     {br|w west=west} tip in the middle ...
+1F: West tip in the middle?  Yeah.
+2G: {ab|Oka} {ab|we} you have a mark, {le|x}, right?
 
 
-4G: Okay, {fp|uh} do you have the pine grove?
-3F: {fp|Uh} {ab|t} ... Yeah, it's right at the east.
-2G: Okay, take your line and go ...
-1F: Around it?
-0G: No, you're going under it, just ... go under it closer to the pine
     grove ...
+1F: Okay, so do I go straight across?
+2G: Yeah.
 
 
-4G: Yeah, you're ... you're coming underneath it.
-3F: Underneath the bay?
-2G: Underneath the concealed hideout.
-1F: No I'm not. ... I'm right {ab|be} ... I'm at the west ... I'm at the
     west ... I'm right at {le|c} in {ci|concealed}.
-0G: Okay.  No, scratch that.  Go up ... to where, you know, you first made
     the jog west.  You need to go around to the east.
+1F: I need to go all the way around it?
+2G: Yeah.
 
 
-4G: Yeah, that's what you want to do.  So it's ...
-3F: All right.  So I'm I'm in between it, so now where am I?  I'm at the
     {le|p} in the {ci|{ab|p}} {fp|uh} {ci|pebbled}.
-2G: Okay.  You have something underneath pebbled shore?
-1F: Yeah, I got to go in between it?
-0G: No, go around it further to the left ...
+1F: Right.
+2G: Okay?  Now ... {ab|f} continue the loop around, and you see the
     flagship?
