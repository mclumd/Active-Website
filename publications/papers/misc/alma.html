<h1>Dialogue System</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Conversational Adequacy</h2>

One major ongoing application of <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active">active logics</a> is that of
building a "conversationally adequate" dialogue agent (see paper on <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active/doc/conversational-adequacy/ver1_ss.html">
Conversational Adequacy</a> -- one can view such an agent as having the
ability to learn in McCarthy's sense of advice-taking, via
conversation).<p>

The long-range research plan envisions the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Process a few simple queries via voice input, requiring the use of
    negative introspection, in the context of the Rochester TRAINS system
    rewritten to employ active logic;
<li>Handle apparent contradictions as in "Send the Boston train to NYC...
    [here the system does something]... No, send the Boston train to NYC"
    where the system has misunderstood the first request and so the user
    says "no" and repeats the same request. This requires the system to
    recognize that "no" refers to the systems response rather than to the
    user's first request;
<li>Understand and generate spelling in metadialogue ("The word I am saying
   is spelled 'xyz'...");
<li>Definitions and/or definitional queries ("What does the word 'xyz'
    mean?");
<li>More general metadialogue: You said, I said, you meant, I meant, etc.;
<li>Reasoning about the physical and social worlds;
<li>Focus, attention and memory;
<li><a

    Conversational adequacy</a>.
</ol>

<!--
We recognize that this is a very daunting list of abilities; currently
we're nearly done with step 1 and preparing to address step 2.

<h3>Alma-Carne</h3>

Alma is an <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/active">active logic</a>
execution system. The major parts are the database and a set of inference
rules. The database evolves through discrete states by applications of the
inference rules and addition of information from external sources through
the Carne process. This process repeats indefinitely.<p>

A ``theory'' of the domain that is being reasoned about can be loaded into
Alma when it is started and the external information can be added by
separate processes or by the user at the interface. The contents of the
database can be viewed at the interface. The evolution of the database can
be recorded in a history file. We should have a query function too.<p>

The Alma language has terms corresponding to the current time and the times
at which formulas were derived. Formulas in the language can also be used
as terms. A built in inference rule detects direct contradictions in the
Alma database, removes them and asserts that there has been a
contradiction. This enables the user to reason about inconsistencies in the
database without the consequences of the contradiction spoiling the whole
database.<p>

Alma together with Carne can be used to specify the behavior of an agent
that can reason about and in a dynamic environment using the theory in Alma
and act and observe that environment using the procedures in Carne.<p>
