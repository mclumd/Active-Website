The long-range research plan envisions the following steps:

   1. understand and generate spelling in metadialogue ("The word I am
saying is spelled 'xyz'...")

   2. definitions and/or definitional queries ("What does the word
'xyz' mean?")

   3. more general metadialogue: You said, I said, you meant, I meant,
etc

   4. reasoning about the physical and social worlds

   5. focus, attention and memory; keeping track of dialog states,
obligatons, aims, etc.

What was the third word?

Is Metroliner and engine?

Which train did you mean when you said "Boston train"?

Is going through Albany an appropriate way to send Metroliner to NYC?

Should I do that now, or after I send Bullet through?

Is it there now?
