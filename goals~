The long-range research plan envisions the following steps:

   1. understand and generate spelling in metadialogue ("The word I am
saying is spelled 'xyz'...")
   2. definitions and/or definitional queries ("What does the word
'xyz' mean?")
   3. more general metadialogue: You said, I said, you meant, I meant,
etc
   4. reasoning about the physical and social worlds
   5. focus, attention and memory
   6. conversational adequacy
