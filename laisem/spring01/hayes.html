Abstract:            </b>
<p>
Interval relations on a line form a familiar algebraic structure with 
13 elements. For many purposes, however, it is convenient to think of 
time as a circle. Interval relations on a circle form a similar 
structure with 16 elements, which is much more symmetrical than the 
linear case, and can be generated from a four-element set 
(corresponding to four ways to place a point with respect to an 
interval) by applying three natural invertible mappings (two 
inversions and a reflection). The transitivity table of this larger 
structure exhibits the same regularities. The linear case can be 
obtained from the cyclic case by a projective transformation from a 
point chosen to be 'at infinity'. The resulting system of constraints 
seems to have several advantages over the traditional one used for 
temporal reasoning.
