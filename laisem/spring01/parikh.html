Abstract:            </b>
<p>

We suggest that the issue of constructing and verifying social
   procedures, which we suggestively call {\em social software}, be pursued
   as systematically as computer software is pursued by computer scientists.
   There are certain complications arising with social software which do not
   arise with computer software, but the similarities are nonetheless
   strong, and tools already exist which would enable us to start work on
   this important project.  We give a variety of suggestive examples like
   that of Solomon and the two mothers, or the problem of the two horsemen,
   and indicate some theoretical work which already exists.  Tools used
   include Game logic, an extension of Dynamic Logic, and Game theory in
   the sense of von-Neumann, Morgenstern and Nash.
