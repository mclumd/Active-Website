<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Human Belief Revision''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

  Belief revision is seen as the required change to an initial set of
beliefs, modeled as a set of propositional sentences, when new
information presents an inconsistency with the initial set. Certain
prescriptive notions of belief revision, such as epistemic entrenchment
and minimal change (which are common in the AI literature) depend on
the representational assumptions adopted for modeling the belief
state, in particular whether a syntactic or model-theoretic perspective is
taken. These perspectives were examined by manipulating the
syntactic form of sentences comprising the initial belief state that
subjects had.  When new and inconsistent information was
encountered, subjects were to select among several alternative sets of
sentences as their preferred new sets of beliefs....the alternatives
differing according to which of the initial beliefs were abandoned in
order to define a new consistent belief set.
<p>
   Four definitions of a minimal change in belief state (from the AI
literature) are surveyed and it is shown that subjects do not follow any
of them. Further, subjects always preferred to eliminate logical
inconsistency by abandoning conditional statements rather than
non-conditional ones, even though either option would lead to a
consistent new belief state.  Revision choices were also affected by
whether the initial belief state included a modus ponens or modus
tollens inference, and whether the problems involved abstract symbols
or natural language cover stories.
<p>
  Various issues are discussed involving the relevance of empirical
evidence of studies like these for notions like minimal change and
epistemic entrenchment in both prescriptive and descriptive principles
of belief revision.

-------------------------
<p>
Jeff Pelletier received a BS in Math and an MA in Philosophy at the
University of Nebraska. He received his PhD at UCLA, where he wrote a
dissertation on "Mass Terms", a subject which continues to hold his
interest.  He also holds master's degrees in Linguistics and Computer
Science from the University of Alberta.  He currently is Professor of
Philosophy and of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

<p>

Much of his writing in philosophical logic/formal semantics is on such
topics as vagueness and the correct representation of "interesting"
natural language constructions like Generics and Mass Terms.  More
recently he has become interested in such Cognitive Science topics
such as how people deal with "belief revisions" and "default
reasoning."  He is currently working on a book called 'Non Standard
Methods for Automated Reasoning in Non Standard Logics' and is editor
of `The Generic Book'. He has been the Executive Editor for *Canadian
Journal of Philosophy* and `Linguistics and Philosophy', and is on the
editorial boards of several other journals.  He has also written a
book and edited anthologies in Ancient Greek Philosophy.
