<H3 CLASS=ABSTRACT>Abstract:</H3>
<P CLASS=ABSTRACT>In the relational model of databases 
a database state is thought of as a
finite collection of relations between elements. 
For many applications it is convenient to pre-fix an infinite
<I>domain</I> where the finite relations are going to be
defined. Often, we also fix a set of domain
functions and/or relations.
These functions/relations are infinite
by their nature.
Some special problems arise if we use such an approach.
In the paper we discuss some of the problems.
e show that there exists a recursive domain with
decidable theory in which (1)&nbsp;there is no recursive syntax for finite
queries, and in which (2)&nbsp;the state-safety problem is undecidable.
<P>
We provide very general conditions on the FO theory of an ordered domain
that ensure collapse of order-generic extended FO queries to pure order
queries over this domain:
the <I>Pseudo-finite Homogeneity Property</I> and
a stronger <I>Isolation Property</I>.
We further distinguish
one broad class of ordered domains satisfying the Isolation Property, the
so-called <I>quasi-</I> domains.
This class includes all  domains,
but also the ordered group of integer numbers and
the ordered semigroup of natural numbers, and some other domains.
<P>
We generalize
all the notions to the case of finitely representable database
states -- as opposed to finite states -- and develop a general lifting
technique that, essentially, allows us to extend any result of the
kind we are interested in, from finite to finitely-representable
states. We show, however, that these results cannot be
transferred to arbitrary infinite states.
<P>
We prove that safe
-programs do not have any effective syntax.
<P>
Open questions
<P>
1.
<P>
Further work needs to be done for integer numbers. For instance, the
authors are under impression that an effective translation algorithm
for locally generic queries over  <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline36" SRC="img1.gif"  >  
can be extracted from
a Fra&#239;ss&#233;-Ehrenfeucht-style proof of decidability of Presburger
Arithmetic.
2.
<P>
In general, we <B>conjecture</B> that
if, for an expansion of  <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline38" SRC="img2.gif"  >  or another expanded domain,
the first order theory of the expanded domain is decidable and
locally generic extended queries do not express more than restricted
ones, then there is an effective translation algorithm.
<P>
3.
<P>
Then, how much higher than + in  <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline38" SRC="img2.gif"  >  can we go?
Obviously,  <IMG WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="img3.gif"  >  make locally generic extended queries impossible to
express as pure order ones because, for example, the query
&quot;the cardinality of <I>P</I> is even&quot; is locally generic and expressible
in the FO extended language but not in the restricted language.
We <B>conjecture</B> that
if, in an expansion of  <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline38" SRC="img2.gif"  > , locally generic extended
queries express more than restricted ones, the first order theory of the
expanded domain is undecidable.
<P>
4.
<P>
Moreover, we <B>conjecture</B> that
if, in an expansion of  <IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline38" SRC="img2.gif"  > , locally generic extended
queries express more than restricted ones, then
there is such a first order formula  <IMG WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline52" SRC="img4.gif"  > 
in the language of the expansion
that for any finite subset <I>A</I> of integer numbers there is such a natural
number <I>b</I> that
<P> <IMG WIDTH=326 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath58" SRC="img5.gif"  > <P>
<P>
5.
<P>
On the side of finitization, a natural question is, can the results for
finitely presented states be extended to more powerful
constraint databases, say, to linear constraint databases? If yes, for
which domains? A specific <B>open problem</B> is, can it be done for
linear constraints with at least one constant over rational or real
numbers.
