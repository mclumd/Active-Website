Evaluating Spoken Dialogue Agents

Recent advances in dialogue modeling, speech recognition, and natural
language processing have made it possible to build spoken dialogue
agents for a wide variety of applications. Potential benefits of such
agents include remote or hands-free access, ease of use, naturalness,
and greater efficiency of interaction.  However, a critical obstacle
to progress in this area is the lack of a general framework for
evaluating and comparing the performance of different dialogue agents.
<p>
This talk presents PARADISE (PARAdigm for DIalogue System Evaluation),
a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents that
integrates and enhances previous work.  PARADISE decouples task
requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, specifies the
relative contribution of various task and dialogue factors to
performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing
different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.  The application
of PARADISE to an experimental spoken dialogue agent that accesses
train schedule information from the web will be discussed.
