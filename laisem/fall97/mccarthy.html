THE LOGIC APPROACH TO HUMAN-LEVEL AI
<p>
John McCarthy, Stanford university
<p>


  It is not surprising that reaching human-level AI has proved to be
  difficult and progress has been slow---though there has been
  important progress.  The slowness and the demand to exploit what has
  been discovered has led many to mistakenly redefine AI, sometimes in
  ways that preclude human-level AI---by relegating to humans parts of
  the task that human-level computer programs would have to do.  In
  the terminology of this paper, it amounts to settling for a
  \emph{bounded informatic situation} instead of the more general
  \emph{common sense informatic situation}.
 <p>
  Overcoming the ``brittleness'' of present AI systems and reaching
  human-level AI requires programs that deal with the \emph{common
    sense informatic situation}---in which the phenomena to be taken
  into account in achieving a goal are not fixed in advance.
<p>
  We discuss reaching human-level AI, emphasizing logical AI and
  especially emphasizing representation problems of information and of
  reasoning.  Ideas for reasoning in the common sense informatic
  situation include nonmonotonic reasoning, approximate concepts,
  formalized contexts and introspection.
