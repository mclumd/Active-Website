How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Box

	In building an agent using logic, a basic danger is that to
   compute a needed conclusion may require an unreasonably large
   derivation.  This talk explores ways this danger can be avoided by
   using modal logic as a specification language.  The results of
   formalizing intuitions about agents and actions in modal logic can
   be regarded as providing declarative specifications of search
   control.  When properly designed, these specifications can ensure
   that needed proofs will be compact, so that proofs are easily
   discovered and search spaces easily exhausted by automatic methods.
   As an illustration, we consider describing, in modal logic, the
   evolving computational state of an agent that can only take limited
   information into account.  Such descriptions specify transparently
   correct computations, but can yield exponential reductions in the
   (worst-case) size of proofs by repeatedly using stored computations
   and by resolving multiple ambiguities modularly in separate parts
   of a proof.
