Adding A Collaborative Agent to Graphical User Interfaces
<p>
Candy Sidner
<p>

In this talk I will discuss the development of an application-independent
toolkit, called Collagen, which we have used to build a software agent that
collaborates with a user of a direct-manipulation graphical interface by
following the rules and conventions of human discourse.  One of the main
results is an interaction history that is segmented according to the
structure of the agent's and user's goals without requiring the agent to
understand natural language.  I will discuss the architecture of the
toolkit and also present a videotaped demo of the working system.  This
work is a joint effort with Chuck Rich, of MERL, A Mitsubishi Electric
Research Lab.
