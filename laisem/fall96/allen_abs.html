<b>TITLE:</b>  
``The TRAINS System: A Conversational Planning Agent''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

 
A conversational agent is a system that can engage in natural language
conversation in order to further its goals. In our TRAINS project, the
goals consist of simple planning and scheduling tasks, and the system
supports mixed initiative planning using several modes of communication:
spoken and keyboard natural language, mousable map displays, and menus. The
project represents a concerted effort to bring work in natural language
understanding, dialog modeling, and planning into a single coherent system.
The TRAINS system is a specific agent that can support unconstrained
dialogue in order to assist the user in solving randomly generated route
planning tasks. Significant effort has been made to make the system robust,
so that it can perform well even in the face of inevitable speech
recognition errors, and can continue the dialogue in a natural way under
any circumstances. This talk will discuss the overall project and its
accomplishments so far, and then focus on a few specific mechanisms that
enable robust dialogue behavior. Because the system can interact in close
to real time, it provides a firm basis for experimentation and data
collection to study different strategies for human-computer dialogue for
collaborative problem solving.
