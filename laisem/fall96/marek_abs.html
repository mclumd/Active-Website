<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Default Reasoning System DeReS and supporting system TheoryBase''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
DeReS is the first implementation of Default Logic of Reiter based on
techniques specially tailored towards optimization of the process of the
computation of extensions. The system is currently running on SUN
workstations at Kentucky and several other places. The system is 
currently able to handle reasonably large theories, often with thousands
of defaults. Since stable models for logic programs can easily be
represented by default theories we  compute stable semantics (for
propositional logic programs) as well.

<p>

In order to test the DeReS we had to build a testing system which
provides us with a wealth of testing examples. This system, TheoryBase,
uses Knuth's Stanford GraphBase as a source of graphs which are
translated into default theories so that extensions correspond to
various combinatorial problems for the graphs.
