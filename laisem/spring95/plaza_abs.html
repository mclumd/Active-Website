<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Soundness and Completeness versus Lifting Property''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
We will give new formulations of the property of soundness and
completeness of a resolution system and of the lifting lemma, and
discuss their relationship.

The discussion will point out why certain resolution systems are not
complete, and that there is a simple method for showing that a
resolution system is ``absolutely incomplete'' -- that there is no
notion of program completion and no logic which could give soundness
and  completeness.  The method will be demonstrated on the case of
basic variants of the SLDNF-resolution.

If time allows, we will mention results of a joint research project
with Dr. Stephen Murrell which is devoted to the development of
the theory of a complete resolution system and to implementation of 
LOGOS - a truly declarative (untyped) logic programming language.
