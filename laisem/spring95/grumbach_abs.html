<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Constraint Databases''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
Until very recently, databases were restricted to the storage and the
manipulation of finite collections of data items.  New applications
such as those involving temporal and spatial data (e.g., geographical
databases) lead very naturally to more general data models allowing
infinite collections of items to be stored in the database.  A new
generation of data models, allowing the representation of infinite
collections is now emerging in the literature.  Various classes of
infinite databases have been considered.  The choice of an adequate
data model is governed by two fundamental principles:
 (i) infinite databases should admit a finite representation 
	 (finite memory), and 
 (ii) a reasonable set of queries should be tractable on the infinite
	  databases (efficiency).

<p>
The finitely representable databases, considered in this talk, are
definable by means of first-order formulas, following the trend opened
by Kanellakis, Kuper and Revesz in PODS'90, where they introduced the
constraint query languages.  The basic idea is to generalize the
relations of the relational model by defining generalized tuples as
conjunctions of constraints.  For instance, (x^2 + y^2 = 1) AND (x <=
0) defines a binary generalized tuple.  We will address various
fundamental issues such as query languages, expressive power and
efficiency, and a few implementation problems.
