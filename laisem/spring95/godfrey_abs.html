<b>TITLE:</b>  
``An Architecture (and Implementation) of a Cooperative Database System''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
Current database systems (and information systems in general) are
uncooperative.  They respond to a query with just the query's
evaluation, the answer set.  This can sometimes be misleading to the
user.

<p>
For database systems to be more cooperative, they sometimes must
respond with more information than just the answer set to the user's
query.  We call such responses cooperative, and such database systems
cooperative.

<p>
We have been designing and implementing such a cooperative database
system (CDBS).  We call our prototype CARMIN.  The system is a shell
that extends a relational database system (RDBMS).  By building on top
of an RDBMS, we reuse existing relational technology (we do not have to
reinvent it), we inherit the optimizations that RDBMSs make, and our
system can be immediately used with existing relational databases.

<p>
In this talk, I introduce the core cooperative techniques that we
support.  I then discuss an architecture for a CDBS that interfaces
with an RDBMS.  The architecture must accommodate the computational
complexities of the various cooperative techniques appropriately, and
it must handle the constraints introduced by the RDBMS interface.  I
will also indicate the technical challenges that arise in an
implementation, such as algorithms that are needed to actuate certain
cooperative techniques efficiently.  (However, in this talk I will not
discuss the implementation issues in any detail, although we address
them in the CARMIN project.)  The architecture also introduces an
appropriate modularity for a CDBS which allows the system to be
constructed incrementally.
