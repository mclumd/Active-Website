<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Reasoning about Actions -- A logic programming perspective''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>
In this talk we discuss several aspects of reasoning about actions,
such as the frame problem, the qualification problem, ramification
problem,  state constraints and their manifestation as qualification
and ramification and actions with complex and non-deterministic
effects.

<p>
We discuss certain similarities between the field of reasoning about
actions and deductive databases and argue why logic programming with
situation calculus notation is a good candidate to represent actions
and their effects. We show how most of the (tricky) aspects of
reasoning about actions mentioned above can be represented using 
logic programs.
