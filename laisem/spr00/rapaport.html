Abstract:            </b>
<p>
No doubt you have on occasion been reading some text that contained an
unfamiliar word, but you were unable or unwilling to find out from a
dictionary or another person what the word meant.  You might, however,
have figured out a meaning for it.  If you never saw the word again,
it would not have mattered.  But if you had seen the word again, you
would have had an opportunity to revise your hypothesis about what it
meant.  The more times you saw the word, the better your definition
would become.

We are developing a theory of computational vocabulary-acquisition
from context.  The system (Cassie) consists of the SNePS
knowledge-representation, reasoning, and acting system together with
a knowledge base of background information representing the knowledge
that a reader (e.g., Cassie) brings to the text containing the unknown
term.  Input to the system consists, in part, of information from the
text being read, which is parsed and incorporated directly into the
knowledge-representation formalism.  Cassie's other input is questions
asked about the material being read.  In particular, we can ask,
"What does <word> mean?"  This triggers a deductive search of the
knowledge base, consisting of background information plus information
from the text, all marked with its "degree" of immunity from revision.
Output consists of a report of Cassie's current definition of the word
in its context, or answers to other queries.

This talk will show how SNePS--a "good old fashioned" symbolic AI
system--works in general, and how Cassie works in particular.
