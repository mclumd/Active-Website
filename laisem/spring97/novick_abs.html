<b>TITLE:</b>  
``A Multi-Factor Approach to Mixed-Initiative Interaction''
<!--=================================================================-->
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<p>

Mixed-initiative interaction is key element in making human-machine
interaction more "natural."  However, mixed-initiative interaction seems to
be one of those things that people think that they can recognize when they
see it even if they can't define it.  Thus what current definitions mean,
in practice, is a cloudy question.  In this talk, I will argue that what we
see as mixed-initiative is actually a product of three component factors:
choice of speaker, choice of task, and choice of outcome.  A series of
dialogue scenarios will illustrate the effects of each of these factors.  I
will further argue that these factors can be negotiated.  In particular,
analysis of turn-taking behaviors suggest that both parties in a dyadic
conversation act in concert to transfer control.  Some aspects of these
behaviors can be modeled with computational agents.

<b>RESUME:</b> 

<p>

David G. Novick is director of research at the European Institute of
Cognitive Sciences and Engineering, in Toulouse, France, and associate
professor of computer science and engineering at the Oregon Graduate
Institute in Portland, OR.  His research interests focus on interactive
systems, including computational models of conversation, technologically
mediated communication, and human-computer interaction. Applications of
these interests include systems design and development methods,
particularly in aviation and aerospace.  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer
and Information Science from the University of Oregon, and his J.D. from
Harvard Law School.  He is an active member of the bars of Oregon and
District of Columbia.
