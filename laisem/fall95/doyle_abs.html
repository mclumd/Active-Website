<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Goals, Preferences and Ceteris Paribus Comparatives''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>
Normal use of comparative relationships, including relative
probability, desirability (preference), height, seaworthiness, and
others, covers both relations among individuals, for which the
meanings are straightforward, and relations among classes of
individuals, for which a variety of interpretations are possible.

<P>
This talk presents a theory of meaning and inference for generic
comparatives that lifts comparisons of individuals to comparisons of
classes ``other things being equal'' by means of {\em contextual
equivalences}, equivalence relations among individuals that vary with
the context of application.  We show how the novel semantical basis
aids in the incremental capture and exploitation of comparatives in
automated reasoning systems by permitting one to construct appropriate
representations from the data, rather than hypothesizing
representations prior to information capture.

<P>
Applied to preferences, the theory provides a common semantical
framework linking the AI planning notion of ``goal'' with the
decision-theoretic notion of ``utility'', interpreting goals as
preference {\em ceteris paribus}, and provides an interesting
alternative to previous logics of preference (von Wright, Hansson).

<P>
This work stems from collaborations with Michael Wellman and Yoav
Shoham.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to attend.
