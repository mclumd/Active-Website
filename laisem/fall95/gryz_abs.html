<b>TITLE:</b>  
``Semantic Query Optimization for Bottom-Up Evaluation''

<P>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>

<P>
 Semantic query optimization uses semantic knowledge in databases (in
 the form of integrity constraints) to rewrite  queries and logic
 programs for the purpose of more efficient query evaluation.  Much
 work has been done to develop various techniques for optimization.
 Most of it, however, is only applicable to top-down query evaluation
 strategies.  Moreover, little attention has been paid to the cost of
 the optimization itself.

<P>
 In this talk, I address the issue of semantic query optimization for
 bottom-up query evaluation strategies with an emphasis on overall
 efficiency.  I restrict my attention to a single optimization
 technique, join elimination.  I discuss various factors that influence
 the cost of semantic optimization, and present an abstract algorithm
 which combines query evaluation with semantic optimization using
 heuristics to achieve the largest possible savings.

<P>
Everyone is welcome to attend.
