<DL ><DT><STRONG>My motivations:</STRONG>
<DD>&nbsp; <BR> Find suitable abstract account of human
reasoning for implementation in artificial agent
<UL><LI> Practical, implementable<LI> close to common sense intuitions<LI> useful for language reasoning/interacting with humans
</UL>
<DT><STRONG>Harman Basics</STRONG>
<DD>&nbsp;
<UL><LI> theoretical (beliefs) vs. practical (intentions, plans)
reasoning<LI> reasoning vs. argument/proof
<DL ><DT><STRONG>reasoning</STRONG>
<DD> actual changes, non-monotonic, inductive, non-logical
<DT><STRONG>argument</STRONG>
<DD> principles of implication, monotonic information increase, deductive, 
<DT><DD> no need for non-monotonic or inductive logic, or deductive
principles of revision
<P>
 </DL><LI> phases in reasoning:
<OL><LI> reflection (consider possibilities)<LI> revision (actual changes)<BR> 
not necessarily conscious
</OL><LI> Explicit vs. implicit belief
</UL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Logic and Reasoning</STRONG>
<DD>: defeasible revision principles
<P>
<OL><LI> *<B>Logical Implication Principle:</B> The fact that one's view
logically implies P can be a reason to accept P.<LI> *<B>Logical Inconsistency Principle</B> Logical Inconsistency is
to be avoided.<LI> *(revision of 1) <B>Logical Closure Principle</B> One's 
beliefs should be <EM>closed under logical implication</EM> In other
words, there is something wrong with one's beliefs if there is a
proposition logically implied by them which one does not already
believe in. In that case, one should either add the implied
proposition to one's beliefs or give up one of the implying beliefs.<LI> <B>clutter avoidance</B> One should not clutter one's mind with
trivialities (explicit beliefs). Accept a new belief P, only if one
has an interest in whether it is true,<LI> *(revision of 1) <B>recognized logical implication principle</B>
One has a reason to believe P if one recognizes that P is logically
implied by one's view.<LI> *(revision of 2) <B>recognized logical inconsistency principle</B>
One has a reason to avoid believing things one recognized to be
logically inconsistent.<LI> (revision of 5) <B>recognized  implication principle</B> One has a reason
to believe P if one recognizes that P is implied by one's view.<LI> (revision of 6) <B>recognized  inconsistency principle</B> One has a
reason to avoid believing things one recognized to be inconsistent.
</OL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Positive versus Negative Undermining</STRONG>
<DD>&nbsp;
<P>
<UL><LI> Foundations theory of belief revision
<UL><LI> keep track of <EM>reasons</EM> for belief<LI> drop beliefs that have no satisfactory justification<LI> add beliefs that don't need justification, or or are justified
by other justified beliefs
</UL><LI> coherence theory of belief revision
<UL><LI> don't need to keep track of reasons<LI> don't need to justify ongoing beliefs<LI> need justification only when there is reason to doubt<LI> drop beliefs when incoherent<LI> strive for minimal change to increase overall coherence
</UL><LI> Karen's aptitude test: (1) test results say scored low in
history (2) believe low aptitude in history (3) believe history course
scored well in was easy (4) decide not to take more history (5) find
out score was erroneous.
<UL><LI> foundations theory says drop all beliefs, reconsider all
decisions based on (1). Seems normatively correct<LI> coherence theory says keep beliefs about ease of course, etc.,
because coherent with other beliefs - only get rid of aptitude belief
which is not consistent with new info. Seems descriptively correct,
based on , e.g., debriefings of psych experiments
</UL><LI> <B>Principle of Positive Undermining</B> One should stop
believing P whenever one positively believes one's reasons for
believing P are no good.<LI> *<B>Principle of Negative undermining</B> One should stop
believing P whenever one does not associate one's belief in P with an
adequate justification (either intrinsic or extrinsic)<LI> Positive undermining (or drop reasons for believing P is no
good). Problem with remembering justification and negative undermining
is clutter avoidance<LI> <B>Principle of Conservatism</B> One is justified in continuing
fully to accept something in the absence of a special reason not to.<LI> <B>Full Acceptance</B> &nbsp;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD> allows oneself to use P as part of starting point for future
theoretical and practical reasoning
<DT><DD> stop investigating P
<DT><STRONG>-</STRONG>
<DD> accepting as working hypothesis has only first principle
<P>
 </DL></UL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Principles of Belief Revision</STRONG>
<DD>&nbsp;
<P>
<OL><LI> <B>clutter avoidance</B>  (see above)<LI> <B>Interest condition (on theoretical reasoning)</B> One is to
add a new proposition P to one's beliefs only if one is interested in
whether P is true (and it is otherwise reasonable for one to believe P).<LI> <B>Interest in the Environment</B> One has a reason to be
interested in objects and events in one's immediate environment.<LI> <B>Interest in facilitating Practical reasoning</B> If one
desires E and believes M's being true would facilitate or hinder E,
one has a reason to be interested in whether M is true.<LI> <B>Interest in Facilitating Theoretical Reasoning</B> If one is
interested in whether P is true and has reason to believe knowing
whether Q is true would facilitate knowing whether P is true, one has
a reason to be interested in whether Q is true <EM>(DRT: backward chaining?)</EM><LI> <B>Interest in Not being Inconsistent</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD> tendency to avoid holding beliefs that are immediately
inconsistent
<DT><DD> tendency to avoid holding beliefs one recognizes to be
indirectly or less obviously inconsistent.
<DT><STRONG></STRONG>
<DD> <B>Get Back Principle</B> One should not give up a belief that one can
easily (and rationally) get right back (so can't just drop the belief
that a set of facts are inconsistent).
<P>
 </DL></OL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>revising intentions</STRONG>
<DD> (practical reasoning)
<P>
<UL><LI> Principles of intention revision:
<OL><LI> <B>principle of conservatism</B> - minimize changes in intentions<LI> <B>principle of coherence</B> change intentions to to make them
more coherent with each other and one's beliefs, discourage changes
which make them less coherent<LI> <B>principle of desire satisfaction</B> encourage change that
promise to promote the realization of one's ends, and discourage
changes that promise frustration of those ends
</OL><LI> types of intention
<OL><LI> explicit - factors in further reasoning<LI> implicit?<LI> positive - involves the thought that it will lead to intended
action<LI> negative - intention not to do something (which one might not do
anyway, so doesn't cause lack of action, but this settles the matter)<LI> conditional - intermediate case - leads one to do something only
if  conditions occur.
</OL><LI> positive intentions require a plan - need to know a way to bring
this intention about<LI> distinction between intentional action and action that is
intended<LI> distinction between ``intends'' and ``aims'' (goal?) - e.g.,
aiming for a hole in one<LI> negative intentions are not aims<LI> rejection of <EM>putative principle that prediction excludes
intention</EM>: ``One cannot for the intention of doing something one can
predict one will do whether one has that intention or not.''
