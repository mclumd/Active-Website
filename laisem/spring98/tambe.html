Abstract:
<br>
Multi-agent  collaboration  or  teamwork  is  becoming increasingly critical in
domains ranging from  virtual  environments  for  training  and  education,  to
information  integration  on  the  internet,  to  interactive entertainment, to
potential  multi-robotic  space  missions.  Coherent  and  effective  teamwork,
surmounting  the  severe uncertainities of these complex, dynamic domains, is a
central challenge. Simply fitting individual  agents  with  fixed  coordination
plans  is  insufficient,  for  their  rigidity  can  cause  severe  failures in
teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reuse.  Instead, highly flexible
coordination and communication is essential.

The  approach  we  propose  is  the development of explicit, domain-independent
teamwork models that  will  enable  agents  to  reason  about  commitments  and
responsibilities in teamwork, and flexibly plan coordination and communication.
Furthermore, these models enable reuse across  domains,  saving  implementation
effort   and   enforcing   consistency.    Additionally,  these  models  enable
"model-based diagnosis" of teamwork failures.    We  are  developing  one  such
teamwork  model, called STEAM, based both on the Joint Intentions theory (Cohen
& Levesque, 96) and the SharedPlans theory (Grosz and Kraus, 96), but with  key
extensions   for   monitoring   and   replanning   in  teamwork,  as  well  for
decision-theoretic  communication  selectivity.  STEAM  has  been  successfully
applied in building several pilot-agent teams for large-scale real-world combat
simulations. STEAM's reuse is also seen in our synthetic Soccer team,  for  the
Robocup tournaments, where we won the third-place prize in over 30 teams in the
simulation league at IJCAI'97.
