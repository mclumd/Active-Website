<p>Project LISTEN:  A Reading Tutor that Listens

Project LISTEN is an inter-disciplinary research project at Carnegie Mellon
University to develop a novel tool for literacy -- an automated Reading
Tutor that displays stories on a computer screen, and listens to children
read them aloud.  To provide a pleasant, authentic experience in assisted
reading, the Reading Tutor lets the child choose from a menu of
high-interest stories from Weekly Reader and other sources -- including
user-authorable stories.  The Reading Tutor adapts Carnegie Mellon's
state-of-the art Sphinx-II speech recognizer to analyze the student's oral
reading.  When the reader asks for help, makes mistakes, or gets stuck, the
Reading Tutor responds with assistance modelled in part after expert
reading teachers [Mostow et al., 1994 National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence], but modified to fit technological limitations and
possibilities [Aist & Mostow, CALL'97 Conference on Multimedia].

In a 1996-97 pilot test at an inner-city elementary school, six third
graders who started almost three years below grade level used the Reading
Tutor with individual supervision by a school aide and gained an average of
two years in under eight months [Mostow & Aist, 1997 Workshop on Perceptual
User Interfaces].  At a July 1997 school reading clinic, 62 children in
grades K-5 tested subsequent versions in a "reading lab" containing eight
Reading Tutors, supervised by a single Human-Computer Interaction master's
student (Dan Barritt).  We are now studying use of the Reading Tutor under
regular classroom conditions by over 100 children in grades 1-5.
<br> <br>
Research questions range from how to support usage without adult
assistance, to how to evaluate and improve the Reading Tutor's
effectiveness based on analysis of gigabytes of data captured by the
Reading Tutor [Mostow & Aist, 1997 National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence; Aist & Mostow, 1998 AAAI Spring Symposium on
Applying Machine Learning to Discourse Processing].

Project LISTEN is directed by Dr. Jack Mostow, Robotics
Institute/Language Technologies Institute/Human-Computer Interaction
Institute.  In a related project in the Statistics Department with
supervision by Professors Rob Kass and Larry Wasserman, PhD student
Tzee-Ming Huang is developing a statistical student model to predict
oral reading performance.
