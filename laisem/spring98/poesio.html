Abstract:
Conversations involve all sorts of verbal activities beyond those
strictly related to the performance of the task at hand. Among other
things, the participants in a conversation have to make sure they both
understand what's going on, to manage turn taking, and to keep each
other informed about their progress in achieving their task.  The
participants share information about the status of all of these
processes; this suggests that the view of the conversational score
they share is more complex than traditionally assumed in models that
concentrate on the propositional content of assertions, in that it
involves both semantic and pragmatic information. In this talk I will
present the latest developments in ongoing work towards a formal model
of the conversational score which attempts to bridge the gap between
theories developed in formal semantics and theories developed in
Artificial Intelligence, but which takes into account all of these
varieties of shared information.  After a brief introduction to some
of the building blocks of our theory, I will show how we are currently
using our model to give a partial specification of the effect of the
dialogue acts included in the Discourse Resource Initiative (DRI)
dialogue act coding scheme.
