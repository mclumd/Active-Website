Abstract:            </b>
<p>
We consider some implementation issues of the deductive query
language for SYNTHESIS - a system for heterogeneous information
resource integration.  The language is characterized
by a collection of advanced features which creates considerable
problem of clean query semantics definition and preserving the
efficiency of query evaluation.  In this talk we focus on
 formulae with bounded universal quantifier, considering the
 problem in the context of extended Datalog: Datalog^{\forall}.
 We consider evaluation of Datalog^{\forall} queries under
 different semantic assumptions, and analyze the Sideways
 Information Passing process, which is not so straightforward
 as in the case of conjunctive body rules.  In particular,
 there is no more a uniform way of having  next supplementary
 relation from a previous one.  We define a  concept of
 relevant formula, which is used for supplementary rule
 generation and describe an algorithm for constructing
 of relevant formula. Then, we specify a magic sets rewriting,
 and more efficient improved magic sets method for Datalog^{\forall}
 queries.
 The methods are generalizations of traditional magic sets technique, and
 can be naturally applied to conjunctive body rules.
