Abstract:            </b>
<p>
What is the difference between a word-giving and a promise?  Speech-act
theorists usefully say that word-givings exhibit a direction of fit "from
word to world," while for promises  the direction is "from world to word."
How can this helpful metaphor be unpacked?  I suggest that there is no hope
under the (anyhow false) assumption of indeterminism.  I suggest that there
is partial illumination to be had by borrowing the austere concept of a
[strategy] as worked out in the theory of agents and choices in branching
time.  The idea is that the intensional content of a speech act such as a
promise is a certain strategy.  Describing such a strategy seems to require
a subtle "double time reference," both to the moment of promising and to
moments at which the promise is satisfied, or infringed, or neither.  The
difference between the strategies attached to word-givings and those
attached to promises help us understand the difference between the
word-to-world direction of fit, and the world-to-word direction.   Of
special interest is that we are then in a position to illuminate the
distinction between two speech acts that are especially easy to confound:
[Giving your word] that you will do something and [promising] that you will
do it.
