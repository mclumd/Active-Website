<p>Title: "Estimators for Stochastic ``Unification-based'' Grammars "

Abstract:</b>
<p>
Developing stochastic versions of ``unification-based'' and other 
linguistically-realistic theories of grammar is difficult because 
they do not naturally decompose into tree-structured dependencies. 
Abney's (1997) Markov Random Field approach provides a general 
framework for describing such non-tree-structured dependencies, 
but the estimator he proposes seems impractical. We describe an 
estimator based on pseudo-likelihood, and use it to develop a 
stochastic version of Lexical Functional Grammar, which we test on 
two small hand-parsed corpora.  Joint work with S. Geman, S. Canon, 
Z. Chi and S. Riezler.
