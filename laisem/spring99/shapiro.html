Abstract:            </b>
<p>
The use of logic for knowledge representation and reasoning
systems is controversial.  There are, indeed, several ways that
standard First Order Predicate Logic is inappropriate for modelling
natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning.  However, a
more appropriate logic can be designed.  This chapter presents several
aspects of such a logic.
