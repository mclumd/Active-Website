My talk will be a contribution to epistemic logic
that has both conceptual and technical sides.
<br><br>

On a conceptual level, we present a modeling
of group-level epistemic actions and the resulting
changes to the knowledge states of agents.  The
actions that we can model include things like honest
announcements to groups, announcements intercepted
by suspicious outsiders, etc.   We work on top of
the standard logic of knowledge, using the Kripke
semantics.  But our system enriches this with new
operators for epistemic actions.   The first people
to mention an enrichment in this way are Jan Plaza and, 
independently, Jelle Gerbrandy.
<br><br>

On the technical side, we study logics with the new
operators and also common knowledge operators.
These are logic of knowledge and change, not knowledge
and time. We have complete axiomatizations, the logics are 
decidable, and there are a number of expressive
power results.  
<br><br>
The work reported here is being applied (sometimes
with interesting modifications) to the modeling
of things like: dialog, probabilistic reasoning,
games, and security.   I hope to survey the applications
of this area as well.

The basic source for my talk is a paper with the same
name, written jointly with Alexandru Baltag and 
Slawomir Solecki.  You can find it at
