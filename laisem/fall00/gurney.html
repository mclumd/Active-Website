Abstract:            </b>
<p>

In this talk I will explain how the Natural Language and Virtual Reality
system implements a simulation of natural language understanding involving
certain types of deixis. Computational implementation of deictic theory
is, of course, not straightforward. This means that semantic theories of
deixis, e.g., based on work by Kripke, Kaplan and Dretske leave some
things unexplained, such as How do people do it?, and How is it possible?
Short of answering these questions we use the NLVR system as a processing
(as opposed to formal) model - showing how something perhaps like deictic
understanding might be done in this instance.
<br><br>
A user of NLVR navigates his point of view through a virtual landscape in
real-time by talking:
<dd>
  Start heading for the Tiefort Mountains
<dd>
  Look to your right
<dd>  Go twice this fast
<dd>  How far is that guy? [pointing at an object]
<br>
The third utterance uses deixis to a property; the last uses deixis to a
perceived object - all simulated.

<br><br>
I will show some video tape first. Then I will concentrate on some of the
relevant representational and computational details of the system.
