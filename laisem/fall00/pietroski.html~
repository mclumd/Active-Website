Abstract:            </b>
<p>

This presentation reports some analyses of student's arguments in 
a learning activity entitled "Argue Graph". This activity is intended to 
make students understand the relationship between learning theories and 
design choices in courseware development. Students twice respond to an 
on-line questionnaire about concrete design choices, a first time alone and 
a second time in pairs. While doing so, they have to provide arguments that 
support their opinions. Pairs are formed so as to maximise differences 
within a pair according to the answers the students gave to the individual 
questionnaire. The analysis of arguments is centered on the effects of 
discussion and opinion conflict on the elaboration of arguments. The 
analysis of written discussion is ongoing and first results will be also 
presented.
