<h2>Misidentification Errors</h2>
<p>An example of a misidentification error is recognizing an object (e.g., an
enemy plane in restricted airspace) and drawing various inferences
about it (it is going too fast to force down, it must be shot down)
and then discovering it is not an enemy plane after all, and that the
belief that it must be shot down should be rejected, whereas the belief
that it is going too fast to force down should not be rejected (it
still is violating restricted airspace and if it cannot be forced down
    then it still must be dealt with somehow but not fired upon).</p>
<p>
We have found automated solutions to problems of this sort using active
logics, where there is no &ldquo;canned&rdquo; solution as to what to do when a
plane is first misidentified, conclusions are drawn, then the error is
found. We have general inference rules that make use of the history
and also of the <i>Now</i> predicate, that allow the system to figure out on
its own what past conclusions it should reject and which to keep, on
    the basis of its knowledge about the world. </p>
