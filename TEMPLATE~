<!-- The above line should be left exactly as it is; it will read
the indicated header material and sidebar into your page when it
is viewed. So you do NOT need to include the standard <html>, <head>,
<title>, <body>, <style>, etc items, nor the terminations </title>

You WILL need </body> and </html> at the end, however. -->
